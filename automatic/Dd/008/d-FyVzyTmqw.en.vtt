00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
also speaking of those original paper

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.290 
also speaking of those original paper
designs<00:00:06.689> you've<00:00:06.930> been<00:00:07.400> so<00:00:08.400> kind<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.790> dig<00:00:09.120> into

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
designs you've been so kind to dig into

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.879 
designs you've been so kind to dig into
the<00:00:09.509> archives<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.049> give<00:00:10.200> us<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.410> few<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.710> those

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the archives and give us a few of those

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.530 
the archives and give us a few of those
which<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.580> think<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> lot<00:00:12.089> of<00:00:12.120> us<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
which I think a lot of us are going to

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240 
which I think a lot of us are going to
be<00:00:12.599> seen<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:13.559> time<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> want

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
be seen for the first time if you want

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.190 
be seen for the first time if you want
to<00:00:14.429> switch<00:00:14.670> over<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.020> map

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
to switch over to some of these map

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.570 
to switch over to some of these map
design<00:00:16.379> talk<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> little<00:00:17.039> bit<00:00:17.189> about<00:00:17.340> how<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
design talk a little bit about how a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.460 
design talk a little bit about how a
midship<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.180> change<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.779> some<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.260> maps

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
midship a change and some of these maps

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.980 
midship a change and some of these maps
change<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.070> paper<00:00:20.220> design<00:00:20.519> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.810> one

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
change from the paper design so this one

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
change from the paper design so this one
this<00:00:22.380> one's<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.830> fun<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.130> midship

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this one's a lot of fun this is midship

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.630 
this one's a lot of fun this is midship
and<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.289> midship<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> very

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and this is actually midship is the very

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.910 
and this is actually midship is the very
first<00:00:27.000> map<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> ever<00:00:27.900> designed<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.740> put

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
first map that I ever designed like put

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.550 
first map that I ever designed like put
pen<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> paper<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.670> design<00:00:30.140> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
pen to paper in design which is that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800 
pen to paper in design which is that
this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.580> chris<00:00:32.760> Carney's<00:00:33.150> version

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
this is this is chris Carney's version

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.350 
this is this is chris Carney's version
of<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.260> took<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> redid<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:35.910> layout

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of he took it over and redid my layout

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.300 
of he took it over and redid my layout
but<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> chris<00:00:37.530> Carney's<00:00:37.860> version<00:00:38.220> of

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
but this is chris Carney's version of

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.370 
but this is chris Carney's version of
the<00:00:38.430> layout<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.970> mid<00:00:39.630> ship<00:00:39.810> has<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.170> blows

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
the layout and mid ship has just blows

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.930 
the layout and mid ship has just blows
my<00:00:40.560> mind<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> became<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.460> popular<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
my mind that it became so popular I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
my mind that it became so popular I
think<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.330> think<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> became<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.560> most

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
think I think it became one the most

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
think I think it became one the most
popular<00:00:44.160> among<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> competitive

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
popular among all the competitive

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
popular among all the competitive
players<00:00:45.810> also<00:00:46.140> yeah<00:00:46.650> was<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> only<00:00:47.190> map<00:00:47.760> i

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
players also yeah was the only map i

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
players also yeah was the only map i
think<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.180> halo<00:00:48.390> history<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:48.930> serve<00:00:49.170> every

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
think in halo history to serve every

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.320 
think in halo history to serve every
tournament<00:00:50.070> game<00:00:50.340> type<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.790> free-for-all

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
want to have a two-on-two CTF map

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.290 
want to have a two-on-two CTF map
because<00:01:05.160> I<00:01:05.309> figured<00:01:05.370> I<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:05.940> going<00:01:06.120> online

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
because I figured I we're going online

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.420 
because I figured I we're going online
but<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:06.870> me<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> bunch<00:01:07.230> people<00:01:07.530> who<00:01:07.710> still

but there's me a bunch people who still
don't<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> internet<00:01:09.630> back<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.230> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
don't have the internet back then this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
don't have the internet back then this
is<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> while<00:01:11.100> ago<00:01:11.340> sir<00:01:13.550> CTF<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.730> so<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.000> fun

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
is a while ago sir CTF is so much fun

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.490 
is a while ago sir CTF is so much fun
and<00:01:15.390> I'd<00:01:15.510> love<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.690> people<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.170> playing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and I'd love for people just playing

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
and I'd love for people just playing
four-way<00:01:16.860> split<00:01:16.980> screen<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.520> able<00:01:17.670> play<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> CTF

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
four-way split screen be able play a CTF

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.020 
four-way split screen be able play a CTF
game<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.800> do<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> two-on-two<00:01:20.430> CTF

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
game so I'm going to do a two-on-two CTF

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
game so I'm going to do a two-on-two CTF
map<00:01:21.300> so<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> basic<00:01:22.200> idea<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.680> map<00:01:22.890> was

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
map so the basic idea in this map was

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.250 
map so the basic idea in this map was
that<00:01:23.340> you'd<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.670> two<00:01:23.850> flags<00:01:24.260> basically

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
that you'd have two flags basically

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.780 
that you'd have two flags basically
across<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.710> chasm<00:01:25.950> looking<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.550> each<00:01:26.670> other

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
across the chasm looking at each other

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170 
across the chasm looking at each other
and<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.720> were<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.020> close<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.040> guy<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and they were so close that the guy the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
and they were so close that the guy the
one<00:01:30.510> guy<00:01:30.540> goes<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.930> offense<00:01:31.260> one<00:01:31.470> stays<00:01:31.710> on

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
one guy goes on offense one stays on

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
one guy goes on offense one stays on
defense<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> guy<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.210> back<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.540> on

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
defense and the guy that's back there on

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
defense and the guy that's back there on
defense<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:34.560> participate<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.250> offense

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
defense can still participate on offense

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
defense can still participate on offense
so<00:01:35.760> he<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.030> lob<00:01:36.450> grenades<00:01:36.630> across<00:01:37.200> he<00:01:37.440> can

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so he can lob grenades across he can

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
so he can lob grenades across he can
still<00:01:37.830> shoot<00:01:38.040> shoot<00:01:38.909> across<00:01:39.120> yeah<00:01:39.870> and<00:01:39.960> that's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
still shoot shoot across yeah and that's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
still shoot shoot across yeah and that's
this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.560> pretty<00:01:41.010> close<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.670> final

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this is pretty close to what the final

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910 
this is pretty close to what the final
map<00:01:42.060> ended<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.840> did<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.350> two

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
map ended up as and we did this like two

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
map ended up as and we did this like two
years<00:01:44.130> before<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.640> game<00:01:44.760> shipped<00:01:45.030> actually

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
years before the game shipped actually

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.320 
years before the game shipped actually
that's<00:01:46.020> awesome<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.350> we've<00:01:46.530> also<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:47.330> also

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
that's awesome and we've also got also

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.910 
that's awesome and we've also got also
got<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.570> early<00:01:48.870> ascension<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.590> similarly

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
got an early ascension which similarly

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
got an early ascension which similarly
similarly<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.850> midship<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.780> look<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.860> bit

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
similarly the midship does look a bit

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.500 
similarly the midship does look a bit
different<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.940> terms<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> map

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
different just in terms of the map

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.140 
different just in terms of the map
layout<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:56.190> was<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.700> rework<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
layout this was actually a rework of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.360 
layout this was actually a rework of
ascension<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:57.840> ascension<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:58.920> were

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
ascension because ascension which were

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.160 
ascension because ascension which were
showing<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.729> here<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.150> turned<00:02:00.870> out<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
showing off here and turned out to be a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
showing off here and turned out to be a
really<00:02:01.320> popular<00:02:01.530> map<00:02:01.890> ascension<00:02:02.340> almost<00:02:02.610> got

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
really popular map ascension almost got

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
really popular map ascension almost got
cut<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.020> first<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:04.350> ascension

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
cut because when we first did ascension

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.649 
cut because when we first did ascension
it<00:02:04.830> was<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.370> any<00:02:05.580> fun<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it was really not any fun I'm had a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.180 
it was really not any fun I'm had a
similar<00:02:06.990> problem<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.500> lock<00:02:07.650> out<00:02:07.830> which<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
similar problem to lock out which is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.059 
similar problem to lock out which is
that<00:02:08.369> every

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
that every

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.649 
that every
all<00:02:09.159> of<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.429> traffic<00:02:09.640> routed<00:02:10.269> through<00:02:10.509> that

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
all of the traffic routed through that

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.630 
all of the traffic routed through that
dish<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> middle<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.769> there<00:02:12.310> was<00:02:12.400> no<00:02:12.519> way

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
dish in the middle and there was no way

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.190 
dish in the middle and there was no way
to<00:02:12.670> get<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:13.030> any<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.389> three<00:02:13.930> satellites

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
to get to any of the three satellites

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.379 
to get to any of the three satellites
without<00:02:14.769> going<00:02:14.950> through<00:02:15.219> that<00:02:15.310> dish<00:02:15.579> so<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:16.389 
without going through that dish so the

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.179 
without going through that dish so the
map<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.689> wasn't<00:02:17.049> working<00:02:17.409> so<00:02:17.439> this<00:02:18.069> is

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
map just wasn't working so this is

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.649 
map just wasn't working so this is
actually<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.609> drawing<00:02:18.819> when<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> got<00:02:19.239> my<00:02:19.389> hands

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
actually my drawing when I got my hands

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.720 
actually my drawing when I got my hands
on<00:02:19.749> it<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.469> was<00:02:20.560> proposing<00:02:20.950> some<00:02:21.280> changes

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
on it and I was proposing some changes

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.879 
on it and I was proposing some changes
to<00:02:21.969> kind<00:02:22.749> of<00:02:22.780> make<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.079> work<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.439> adding<00:02:23.739> these

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
to kind of make it work and adding these

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.970 
to kind of make it work and adding these
peripheral<00:02:24.879> lower<00:02:25.090> has<00:02:25.689> around<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.230> outside

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
peripheral lower has around the outside

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.879 
peripheral lower has around the outside
which<00:02:27.219> weren't<00:02:27.400> there<00:02:27.579> originally<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> leap

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
which weren't there originally the leap

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.280 
which weren't there originally the leap
of<00:02:30.040> faith<00:02:30.219> was<00:02:30.549> real<00:02:30.969> you<00:02:31.329> can<00:02:31.689> see<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.900> want<00:02:32.260> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
of faith was real you can see I want to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.110 
of faith was real you can see I want to
have<00:02:32.439> this<00:02:32.590> spot<00:02:33.219> where<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.549> jump<00:02:33.760> down<00:02:33.819> if

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
have this spot where you jump down if

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.759 
have this spot where you jump down if
you<00:02:34.209> look<00:02:34.389> up<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.750> left<00:02:35.139> you<00:02:35.319> see<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.560> says

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
you look up in the left you see it says

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.679 
you look up in the left you see it says
fog<00:02:36.099> right<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.669> yeah<00:02:37.090> some<00:02:37.299> awesome

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
fog right there yeah some awesome

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.409 
fog right there yeah some awesome
drawings<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:39.069> idea<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.639> for<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.150> leap<00:02:40.299> of

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
drawings the idea was for the leap of

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.940 
drawings the idea was for the leap of
faith<00:02:40.599> actually<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.200> you'd<00:02:41.319> run<00:02:41.530> up<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
faith actually that you'd run up and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.409 
faith actually that you'd run up and
you'd<00:02:42.340> look<00:02:42.519> down<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.000> all<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.269> would<00:02:43.389> see

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419 
you'd look down and all you would see

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.780 
you'd look down and all you would see
was<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.719> bank<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.139> fog<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.129> then<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.579> just<00:02:45.760> have

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
was a bank of fog and then you just have

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.250 
was a bank of fog and then you just have
to<00:02:46.000> jump<00:02:46.239> down<00:02:46.359> through<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.750> fog<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.109> hope

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to jump down through the fog and hope

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.069 
to jump down through the fog and hope
you<00:02:47.379> landed<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.340> was<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.669> was

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
you landed it so that was what that was

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.539 
you landed it so that was what that was
indicating<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.290> yeah<00:02:50.439> this<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.799> yeah<00:02:51.340> after

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
indicating so yeah this one yeah after

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.819 
indicating so yeah this one yeah after
we<00:02:51.579> made<00:02:51.790> these<00:02:51.939> changes<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.680> totally<00:02:53.680> turned

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
we made these changes it totally turned

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.679 
we made these changes it totally turned
around<00:02:53.919> the<00:02:54.129> map<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.639> uh<00:02:54.669> got<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.299> lot<00:02:55.510> better

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
around the map so uh got a lot better

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.869 
around the map so uh got a lot better
and<00:02:56.439> this<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:56.919> uh<00:02:56.949> this<00:02:57.129> next<00:02:57.730> one<00:02:57.819> that

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
and this is this uh this next one that

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.220 
and this is this uh this next one that
we're<00:02:58.000> gonna<00:02:58.090> go<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.299> right<00:02:58.569> after<00:02:58.689> this<00:02:58.959> slide

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
we're gonna go to right after this slide

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.990 
we're gonna go to right after this slide
is<00:02:59.409> I<00:02:59.859> think<00:02:59.919> a<00:03:00.129> last-minute<00:03:00.519> addition<00:03:00.909> we

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is I think a last-minute addition we

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.209 
is I think a last-minute addition we
just<00:03:01.180> got<00:03:01.329> this<00:03:01.540> paper<00:03:01.840> design<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.500> this

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
just got this paper design in this

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.250 
just got this paper design in this
morning<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.819> sure<00:03:03.969> it's<00:03:04.120> also<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.449> fan

started looking at what we had and we

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.759 
started looking at what we had and we
realized<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.389> we<00:04:01.810> really<00:04:02.139> didn't<00:04:02.560> have

realized that we really didn't have

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.589 
realized that we really didn't have
anything<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.310> we<00:04:03.400> thought<00:04:03.519> was<00:04:03.699> sexy<00:04:04.209> enough

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
anything that we thought was sexy enough

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.830 
anything that we thought was sexy enough
43<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:06.039> we<00:04:06.159> kind<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.400> scrambled<00:04:06.909> all<00:04:07.629> of<00:04:07.810> a

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
43 so we kind of scrambled all of a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.999 
43 so we kind of scrambled all of a
sudden<00:04:07.900> we<00:04:08.139> had<00:04:08.259> a<00:04:08.289> bunch<00:04:08.469> of<00:04:08.590> additional

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
sudden we had a bunch of additional

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.099 
sudden we had a bunch of additional
resources<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.789> make<00:04:09.939> something<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.840> we<00:04:10.959> sort

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
resources to make something so we sort

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.990 
resources to make something so we sort
of<00:04:11.199> scrambled<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.889> this<00:04:12.009> is<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.699> paper

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
of scrambled and this is the the paper

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.839 
of scrambled and this is the the paper
