me<00:00:49.989> anyway<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.350> think<00:00:50.649> it's<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.489> app<00:00:51.730> we<00:00:51.940> use

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
me anyway I think it's the app we use

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.139 
me anyway I think it's the app we use
and<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:53.320> sort<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.800> advised<00:00:54.100> us<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.430> look<00:00:55.000> at

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
and he sort of advised us to look at

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.420 
and he sort of advised us to look at
your<00:00:55.239> wall<00:00:55.450> wait<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.170> that's<00:00:56.440> how<00:00:56.680> we<00:00:56.739> decided

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
your wall wait and that's how we decided

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.600 
your wall wait and that's how we decided
the<00:00:58.120> lineup<00:00:58.450> so<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:59.260> can't<00:00:59.920> see<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.280> war<00:01:00.430> went

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
the lineup so you can't see the war went

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.760 
the lineup so you can't see the war went
into<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.910> water<00:01:01.149> remember<00:01:01.930> how<00:01:02.079> you<00:01:02.110> find<00:01:02.559> it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
into the water remember how you find it

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.020 
into the water remember how you find it
out<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.920> think<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.340> have<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.489> get<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.760> enemy

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
out I think you have to get the enemy

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.160 
out I think you have to get the enemy
clan<00:01:04.180> after<00:01:04.329> the<00:01:04.479> war<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.689> get<00:01:04.869> your<00:01:04.989> wall

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
clan after the war and get your wall

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.260 
clan after the war and get your wall

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
rankings but essentially we split the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.800 
rankings but essentially we split the
teams<00:01:07.479> based<00:01:07.810> on<00:01:08.049> rank<00:01:08.319> so<00:01:09.479> three<00:01:10.479> town<00:01:10.689> or

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
teams based on rank so three town or

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.609 
teams based on rank so three town or
10-7<00:01:11.469> town<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.770> lines<00:01:12.009> each<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.350> going<00:01:14.560> to

10-7 town on lines each it's going to

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.859 
10-7 town on lines each it's going to
beat<00:01:14.799> you've<00:01:14.950> probably<00:01:15.509> faces<00:01:16.509> probably

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:42.959 
days I just wanted to give you a little
bit<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.810> heads<00:01:40.990> up<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.319> it's<00:01:41.740> happened<00:01:42.189> I'm

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
bit the heads up that it's happened I'm

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.419 
bit the heads up that it's happened I'm
not<00:01:43.119> going<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.359> go<00:01:43.419> through<00:01:43.569> all<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.779> bases

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
not going to go through all the bases

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.760 
not going to go through all the bases
maybe<00:01:45.429> after<00:01:46.419> the<00:01:46.569> ward<00:01:46.779> I<00:01:47.020> don't<00:01:47.439> know<00:01:47.590> it's

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
maybe after the ward I don't know it's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.169 
maybe after the ward I don't know it's
very<00:01:47.889> difficult<00:01:48.279> because<00:01:48.609> people<00:01:49.060> aren't

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
very difficult because people aren't

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.149 
very difficult because people aren't
going<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.389> want<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.599> see<00:01:49.749> the<00:01:49.869> their<00:01:50.709> base<00:01:50.919> is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
going to want to see the their base is

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.339 
going to want to see the their base is
shown<00:01:51.429> but<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.969> suppose<00:01:52.630> that's<00:01:52.659> part<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.259> the

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
shown but I suppose that's part of the

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.279 
shown but I suppose that's part of the
