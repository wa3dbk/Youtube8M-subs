00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
slide to unlock nothing of that so you

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.090 
slide to unlock nothing of that so you
put<00:02:52.690> your<00:02:52.810> nail<00:02:53.050> here<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.920> just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
put your nail here and then you just

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.620 
put your nail here and then you just

as of yet what I like about the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.390 
as of yet what I like about the
interface<00:04:51.419> is<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:52.380> always<00:04:52.500> did<00:04:52.949> that<00:04:53.130> they

optimus black and now you're doing it
with<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.610> phone<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.090> they<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.169> separate

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
with this phone is they have a separate

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.650 
with this phone is they have a separate
section<00:05:01.800> in<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.910> case<00:05:03.150> they<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:03.389> separate

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
section in this case they are separate

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.779 
section in this case they are separate
section<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:03.990> 3d<00:05:04.320> applications<00:05:04.979> also<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.699> in

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
section for 3d applications also so in

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.909 
section for 3d applications also so in
case<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.000> download<00:05:06.570> any<00:05:06.780> other<00:05:06.990> 3d<00:05:07.320> apps<00:05:07.590> they

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
case you download any other 3d apps they

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.219 
case you download any other 3d apps they
show<00:05:08.160> up<00:05:08.280> here<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:09.900> your<00:05:09.930> standard

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
show up here you have your standard

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.300 
show up here you have your standard
applications<00:05:11.009> here<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:12.860> whatever<00:05:13.860> absolute

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
applications here and whatever absolute

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.219 
applications here and whatever absolute
download<00:05:14.849> show<00:05:15.270> up<00:05:15.419> in<00:05:15.599> a<00:05:15.720> separate<00:05:16.050> section

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
download show up in a separate section

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.800 
download show up in a separate section
so<00:05:16.800> basically<00:05:17.729> there<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.060> no<00:05:18.270> clutter<00:05:18.539> you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
so basically there is no clutter you

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.540 
so basically there is no clutter you
don't<00:05:19.020> have<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.320> search<00:05:19.530> between<00:05:20.009> 50

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
don't have to search between 50

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.339 
don't have to search between 50
applications<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.330> find<00:05:21.569> what<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:21.870> want<00:05:22.110> you

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
applications to find what you want you

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.200 
applications to find what you want you
probably<00:05:22.919> will<00:05:23.250> know<00:05:23.460> where<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.880> will<00:05:23.970> find

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
probably will know where you will find

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.909 
probably will know where you will find
immediately<00:05:25.490> nice<00:05:26.490> nicely<00:05:27.060> for<00:05:27.240> our<00:05:27.360> thing

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.469 
of up converting any 2d video into 3d
now<00:05:52.409> how<00:05:52.830> you<00:05:52.889> do<00:05:53.159> this<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.550> we've<00:05:54.030> passed<00:05:54.330> the

now how you do this is we've passed the

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.969 
now how you do this is we've passed the
video<00:05:54.750> here<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.229> we<00:05:55.259> can<00:05:55.500> show<00:05:55.650> you<00:05:55.680> how

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
video here so that we can show you how

video here so that we can show you how
we<00:05:56.039> do<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.400> there's<00:05:56.969> this<00:05:57.090> little<00:05:57.300> key<00:05:57.990> here

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
we do it there's this little key here

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.790 
we do it there's this little key here
it's<00:05:59.520> currently<00:06:00.060> 2d<00:06:00.479> 2d<00:06:00.900> is<00:06:01.080> bigger<00:06:01.380> in<00:06:01.590> size

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
it's currently 2d 2d is bigger in size

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.020 
it's currently 2d 2d is bigger in size
which<00:06:02.099> means<00:06:02.340> this<00:06:02.460> video<00:06:02.759> is<00:06:02.849> currently

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
which means this video is currently

see<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.319> is<00:06:39.590> what<00:06:39.979> essentially<00:06:40.520> an

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
see this is what essentially an

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.300 
see this is what essentially an
upconverting<00:06:41.270> 2d<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.229> 3d<00:06:42.259> video<00:06:42.860> looks<00:06:43.099> like

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
upconverting 2d to 3d video looks like

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.600 
upconverting 2d to 3d video looks like
on<00:06:43.490> this<00:06:43.610> phone<00:06:44.530> not<00:06:45.530> really<00:06:45.889> sure<00:06:46.099> how<00:06:46.400> much

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
on this phone not really sure how much

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.670 
on this phone not really sure how much
of<00:06:46.789> the<00:06:46.879> 3d<00:06:47.210> effect<00:06:47.449> you<00:06:47.990> would<00:06:48.229> have<00:06:48.349> seen

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
of the 3d effect you would have seen

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.790 
of the 3d effect you would have seen
through<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:48.979> video<00:06:49.220> but<00:06:49.580> what<00:06:49.819> we<00:06:50.000> can<00:06:50.240> say<00:06:50.449> is

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
through the video but what we can say is

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.490 
through the video but what we can say is
for<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:51.949> glass<00:06:52.280> lyst<00:06:52.610> 3d<00:06:53.030> bit<00:06:53.300> this<00:06:54.229> thing

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
for the glass lyst 3d bit this thing

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.149 
for the glass lyst 3d bit this thing
does<00:06:54.710> quite<00:06:55.340> ok<00:06:55.729> however<00:06:56.949> there<00:06:57.949> are<00:06:58.129> times

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159 
does quite ok however there are times

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.279 
does quite ok however there are times
when<00:06:58.610> you<00:06:58.729> still<00:06:59.030> feel<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.389> eye<00:06:59.569> strain<00:07:00.050> I

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
when you still feel the eye strain I

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.189 
when you still feel the eye strain I
particularly<00:07:00.889> did<00:07:01.220> after<00:07:01.580> watching<00:07:01.750> 10<00:07:02.750> or<00:07:02.900> 15

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
particularly did after watching 10 or 15

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.800 
particularly did after watching 10 or 15
minutes<00:07:03.349> of<00:07:03.530> 3d<00:07:03.800> content<00:07:04.159> on<00:07:04.370> this<00:07:04.659> your<00:07:05.659> lies

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
minutes of 3d content on this your lies

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.330 
minutes of 3d content on this your lies
will<00:07:06.080> still<00:07:06.380> feeling<00:07:06.650> the<00:07:06.740> strain<00:07:06.919> so<00:07:07.130> don't

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
will still feeling the strain so don't

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.689 
will still feeling the strain so don't
think<00:07:07.580> without<00:07:07.970> glasses<00:07:08.900> 3d<00:07:09.259> basically<00:07:10.220> means

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
think without glasses 3d basically means

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.050 
think without glasses 3d basically means
stress<00:07:11.389> free<00:07:11.659> 3d<00:07:11.930> no<00:07:12.199> that's<00:07:12.500> not<00:07:12.650> the<00:07:12.800> case

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
stress free 3d no that's not the case

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.779 
stress free 3d no that's not the case
secondly<00:07:14.530> the<00:07:15.530> big<00:07:15.770> question<00:07:16.159> is<00:07:16.280> how<00:07:16.550> much<00:07:16.729> of

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
secondly the big question is how much of

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.820 
secondly the big question is how much of
3d<00:07:17.330> will<00:07:17.569> you<00:07:17.659> actually<00:07:17.870> be<00:07:18.199> using<00:07:18.650> on<00:07:18.770> the

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
3d will you actually be using on the

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.520 
3d will you actually be using on the
phone<00:07:19.099> with<00:07:19.610> the<00:07:19.729> screen<00:07:20.090> about<00:07:20.690> 4.3<00:07:21.289> inches

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530

in<00:07:21.710> size<00:07:21.970> because<00:07:23.470> ideally<00:07:24.470> 3d<00:07:25.039> is<00:07:25.219> meant<00:07:25.490> to

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
be viewed on screens bigger than 32 or

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.790 
be viewed on screens bigger than 32 or
the<00:07:29.090> wrong<00:07:29.270> as<00:07:29.449> if<00:07:29.630> 40<00:07:29.990> inches<00:07:30.319> for

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
comfortable moving so this one

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.350 
comfortable moving so this one
essentially<00:07:33.289> it's<00:07:33.560> a<00:07:33.860> novelty<00:07:34.430> feature<00:07:34.669> which

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
essentially it's a novelty feature which

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.320 
essentially it's a novelty feature which
you<00:07:35.509> might<00:07:35.750> use<00:07:36.080> a<00:07:36.469> few<00:07:36.919> times<00:07:37.129> but<00:07:37.699> I<00:07:38.000> don't

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.330 
you might use a few times but I don't

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.360 
you might use a few times but I don't
