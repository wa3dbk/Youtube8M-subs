alibi Tony and I'm pretty sure these are
only<00:00:20.010> engaging<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:20.970> try<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.600> grind<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
only engaging you can try and grind it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.400 
only engaging you can try and grind it
on<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> floor<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.939> they're<00:00:23.939> probably<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.410> so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
on the floor but they're probably not so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
on the floor but they're probably not so
right<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
right here you can kind of see like this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
right here you can kind of see like this
little<00:00:27.390> lot<00:00:27.599> area<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.650> it's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
little lot area but it's not there it's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.650 
little lot area but it's not there it's
kind<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> road<00:00:29.519> you'll<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
kind of down the road you'll see and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.420 
kind of down the road you'll see and
that's<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> police<00:00:31.800> stinger<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.250> it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that's where the police stinger is it's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
that's where the police stinger is it's
the<00:00:32.610> fastest<00:00:33.120> car<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.290> um<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.829> Tony

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the fastest car I think in um you Tony

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.610 
the fastest car I think in um you Tony
and<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.149> amazingly<00:00:36.870> fast<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and it's amazingly fast like it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
and it's amazingly fast like it's
probably<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> best<00:00:38.760> card<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.300> as

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
probably the best card I can use as

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.610 
probably the best card I can use as
pretty<00:00:40.649> distant<00:00:40.980> handling<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> speed<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
pretty distant handling the speed is the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.110 
pretty distant handling the speed is the
speed<00:00:43.739> types<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.250> salt<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
speed types of salt and you know I can

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.630 
speed types of salt and you know I can
easily<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.600> away<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:45.840> anything<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.640> right

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
easily get away from anything and right

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
easily get away from anything and right
here<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.780> doesn't<00:00:49.110> respond<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.680> not

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
here I it doesn't respond if it's not

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
here I it doesn't respond if it's not
here<00:00:50.129> guys<00:00:50.280> when<00:00:50.610> um<00:00:50.930> first<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
here guys when um first get there just

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.400 
here guys when um first get there just
do<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.539> drive<00:00:54.539> around<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
do what I do gonna drive around in a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.910 
do what I do gonna drive around in a
circle<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.750> it'll<00:00:57.750> probably<00:00:57.899> respond<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
circle and it'll probably respond and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920 
circle and it'll probably respond and
right<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> APC<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.480> guys<00:01:00.719> you
