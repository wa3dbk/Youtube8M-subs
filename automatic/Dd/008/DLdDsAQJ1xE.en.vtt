through<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> gap<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.869> unfortunately

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
through the gap and there unfortunately

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
through the gap and there unfortunately
doable<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.400> um<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:26.790> completely<00:01:27.240> unable

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

to<00:01:27.780> kill<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.280> hit<00:01:29.430> market<00:01:29.729> or

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to kill and I think we get hit market or

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
to kill and I think we get hit market or
something<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.119> made<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> hit<00:01:30.509> market<00:01:30.780> i'm<00:01:30.869> not

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
something I made of hit market i'm not

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
something I made of hit market i'm not
entirely<00:01:31.560> sure<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.939> can't<00:01:33.150> kill<00:01:33.329> them

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
entirely sure but I just can't kill them

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880

probably over the weekend i'm going to
split<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.110> parts<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> fairly

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
split it into two parts because a fairly

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
split it into two parts because a fairly
long<00:01:59.070> latch<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.579> think<00:01:59.759> it's<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> 12<00:02:00.270> minutes

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
long latch I think it's like 12 minutes

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.270 
long latch I think it's like 12 minutes
or<00:02:00.630> something<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.380> sprint<00:02:01.649> 26

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
or something like that so sprint 26

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.219 
or something like that so sprint 26
minutes<00:02:02.460> parts<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> real<00:02:03.960> relic

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
minutes parts and but a real relic

game I put some dish on my hat and then

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.040 
game I put some dish on my hat and then
trying<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.910> bleep<00:02:49.060> spit<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.450> out<00:02:49.690> for<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.900> guys

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
trying to bleep spit it out for you guys

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.120 
trying to bleep spit it out for you guys
so<00:02:50.230> you're<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:50.650> getting<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.890> bit<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.070> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
so you're so you're getting a bit of a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.880 
so you're so you're getting a bit of a
mix<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:52.239> I'm<00:02:52.750> really<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.380> really<00:02:53.440> like<00:02:53.739> in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
mix but I'm really really really like in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.470 
mix but I'm really really really like in
battlefield<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.730> definitely<00:02:54.880> think<00:02:55.209> this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
battlefield and I definitely think this

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.690 
battlefield and I definitely think this
game<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.870> better<00:02:56.680> than<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.190> more<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:57.519> three<00:02:57.670> I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
game is better than one more for three I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.610 
game is better than one more for three I
think<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.239> more<00:02:58.360> polished<00:02:59.019> it's<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.410> kind

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
think it's more polished it's more kind

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.070 
think it's more polished it's more kind
of<00:02:59.709> finished<00:03:00.100> but<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:01.090> modern<00:03:01.300> 143<00:03:01.750> it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
of finished but as I think modern 143 it

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.229 
of finished but as I think modern 143 it
just<00:03:02.410> feels<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:03.940> know<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> just

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
just feels like I don't know it just

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.750 
just feels like I don't know it just
feel<00:03:04.569> shit<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.860> it's<00:03:06.069> something<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.400> may<00:03:06.519> talk

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
feel shit and it's something I may talk

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.610 
feel shit and it's something I may talk
about<00:03:07.000> actually<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:07.810> was<00:03:08.200> thinking<00:03:08.500> about

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
about actually like I was thinking about

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.350 
about actually like I was thinking about
doing<00:03:08.680> us<00:03:08.980> our<00:03:09.130> bathroom<00:03:09.550> see<00:03:09.730> again<00:03:10.000> smaller

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
doing us our bathroom see again smaller

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.970 
doing us our bathroom see again smaller
off<00:03:10.480> with<00:03:10.600> your<00:03:10.720> bathroom<00:03:11.140> key<00:03:11.350> verses<00:03:11.590> modern

one-fourth e can a common tree maybe on

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.880 
one-fourth e can a common tree maybe on
the<00:03:13.810> conquest<00:03:14.200> game<00:03:14.380> or<00:03:14.500> some<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.739> that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the conquest game or some of that

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.979 
the conquest game or some of that
because<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:16.060> don't<00:03:16.329> all<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.630> been<00:03:16.750> played

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
because I don't all just been played

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.150 
because I don't all just been played
I've<00:03:17.170> been<00:03:17.320> playing<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:17.650> game<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
I've been playing this game and I just

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.100 
I've been playing this game and I just
feel<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.820> game<00:03:18.850> feels<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:19.780> much<00:03:19.900> better

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
feel like this game feels so much better

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.750 
feel like this game feels so much better
it<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.440> feels<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:21.010> they<00:03:21.160> put<00:03:21.340> more<00:03:21.579> time

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
it just feels like they put more time

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.069 
it just feels like they put more time
until<00:03:22.090> they<00:03:22.180> put<00:03:22.299> more<00:03:22.480> effort<00:03:22.810> into<00:03:22.930> this

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
until they put more effort into this

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.960 
until they put more effort into this
game<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.829> deserves<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.400> better<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.910> be

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
game it deserves to be better to be

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.640 
game it deserves to be better to be
honest<00:03:25.209> terribly<00:03:25.810> recognized<00:03:26.380> as<00:03:26.530> being

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
honest terribly recognized as being

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.190 
honest terribly recognized as being
better<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.700> definitely<00:03:28.209> do<00:03:28.420> think<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.780> a
