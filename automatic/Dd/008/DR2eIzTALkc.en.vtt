00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
holding down our button and it should

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.410 
holding down our button and it should
throw<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> nade<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:47.030> let's<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
throw a nade and let's see if it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
throw a nade and let's see if it
explodes<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:51.440> don't<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> to

explodes there I don't know you have to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.080 
explodes there I don't know you have to
believe<00:00:53.520> mix<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> angles<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.780> bad<00:00:54.989> but

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
believe mix it angles really bad but

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.110 
believe mix it angles really bad but
it's<00:00:57.090> cliff<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.440> Navy<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.890> thrown<00:00:59.280> after<00:00:59.579> you

die<00:01:01.760> steel<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.229> we

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
die steel one more time here see if we

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.359 
die steel one more time here see if we
can<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> better<00:01:04.650> camera<00:01:05.250> angle<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:07.369> all

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
can get a better camera angle here all

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
can get a better camera angle here all
right<00:01:08.960> hold<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:12.380> let's<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.560> here

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
the angles so bad but you can believe me

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.499 
the angles so bad but you can believe me
hopefully<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:39.509> hope<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.990> boil<00:01:40.200> it
