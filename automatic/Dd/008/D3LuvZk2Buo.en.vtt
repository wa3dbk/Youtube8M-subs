00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello today i'm with josiane 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.410
 coach self-confidence of all my 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.750
 coaches point fr so if you are 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.120
 ask a lot for example at 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 job that we ask you piles of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 things to do the problem is that we 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.330
 can not say yes to everyone 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 josiane will show you how to do 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.670
 to know how to say no look well in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.910
 effect will tell us it's very difficult in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.920
 no longer say no to his children 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.079
 to say no to his boss is not at all 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 the same thing 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.710
 the issues in any case are not the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.710
 even say no to his colleagues 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.469
 it is also to take the risk of returning 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.360
 in conflict but at the same time that they have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 want to be good 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:58.469
 resolve engage the conversation 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 demand and so on with awareness 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.780
 that we are in our right and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.860
 that actually we can not 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.320
 to comply with all requests 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.750
 it's part of our quality of life 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 imagine if you can not say 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 no how are you going to manage your 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 schedule and then how do you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.320
 are going to do next time you do not 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 can no longer say no once you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.659
 go say yes people will take 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.060
 the habit of constantly asking you 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 services what always needs 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.790
 to have in mind is to communicate in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
 empathy what are we building 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.140
 attention empathy is not the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 sympathy 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.159
 empathy it's actually 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 understand what the other person is saying 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.970
 emotions but also to be respected 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.340
 that is, the other respect the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.970
 your emotions as well as the other 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.960
 hear what you have to say it's 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.740
 finally a winning communication 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:17.920
 winner to simplify things 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:21.010
 I'll take an example imagine it 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.590
 is 18 hours you are about to 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.920
 leave and your colleague that you like 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 by the way well come ask you a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.010
 service say I could not finish the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.520
 folder x 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.510
 I absolutely have to go do you 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.030
 could do it for me 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.300
 and then you really got engaged 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 to see them the dance show of 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.550
 your daughter and it's so much 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.260
 important to her for you that 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 it is out of the question 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.780
 but in your heart you know it 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.060
 know that you accept and yet the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.709
 colleague 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.100
 it's also important in these cases 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.380
 there I will give you points on 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 could apply are always the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:19.989
 even the first point to give himself the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.280
 right to tell us the second point does not 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.910
 not to justify 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.590
 just explained the justification it's 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.070
 when you really get into 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.610
 details 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.420
 yes you understand my daughter is not going to be 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.209
 content 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.070
 stir up after how am I going to feel if 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.620
 I will not see the dance show 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.320
 so that's the justification does not end 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.950
 not and in addition to the self styles 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.000
 it's not so good we explain 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.600
 said no I promised my daughter to go 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.959
 to look for her 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 daly look to see with her I 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.090
 promised and so on I have to leave 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.310
 the third time actually we can 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.970
 negotiate not to stay on one 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.720
 feeling of failure 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.330
 a negative feeling about the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.920
 nobody with whom we are 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.190
 discuss but we can negotiate 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 only once you say no 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.459
 to make things easier 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.160
 and then maybe that will serve as 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.200
 conclusion this may be the point you 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.350
 warns in any case that will be a point 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.210
 super important is when you do not have 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.010
 at all want to say yes how is 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.870
 always the sentences by saying first 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.430
 no and then repeated this negation 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.680
 no I'm sorry but I can not 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.380
 no, I promised my daughter to go 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.390
 search 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.800
 If you want the next time when you me 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.520
 will ask for a service it's me 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.350
 warn already in advance and there you will see 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.190
 I will do my best to help you 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.850
 but today it's no it's not 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.030
 possible 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.120
 here I hope all these points 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:13.520
 can help you to have a 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.690
 better life with others and then 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.290
 respect yourself and others 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.290
 will respect
