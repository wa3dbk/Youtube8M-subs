00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello and welcome on how 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.629
 to photograph at the point as then in 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.340
 this video I was talking about small 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.410
 habits and good reflexes to have 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 when we are going to go from the amateur stage and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.639
 professionals I have a month to be 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 gone through there are always some 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 difficulties of the questions that we 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 there are pitfalls 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.330
 there are some little things that are 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830
 details it's not going to break three paws at 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.060
 a duck 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 this will not bring the ultimate solution 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 to succeed in making a living 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.179
 of his passion but it can indeed you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.349
 avoid certain difficulties and 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.050
 mistakes that can cost you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 thereafter then the first things 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 is that when we are amateur and we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.070
 wants to go professional because we do not have 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 already stopped the difference the contrast 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 who's going to be between this amateur status 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 and pros when it is low amateur 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 is still searching but still 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.000
 in demand of the look of the others 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.640
 we are always looking for we are a little 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 timorous and while when we are going to pass 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 professional we will have the sooner the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.949
 look at our customers so there he will not 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.270
 must be that happens to me 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660
 is in demand it will have to be more 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.030
 early on the care 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.229
 reassure the client not to be 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.280
 I really have to have a picture of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.190
 someone strong who knows where he is going 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.360
 not be bothered by the slightest worry 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.830
 to really be someone who goes 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.610
 look in front of you and spent his 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.680
 time to look behind 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.050
 it's really advanced reassuring the client 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.780
 by this approach there someone who knows 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.820
 what is he talking about and where is he going 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 an important thing when we start 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 as professional the thing too who 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.789
 is essential is to have a good site 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 Internet 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.289
 so here it's mostly me to have seen 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.950
 a lot of websites of two 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.140
 confreres and that makes me every time 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.780
 it makes me want to scream it 's 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.179
 to say but your image is important 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 it's essential for you if you do not have 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.990
 no studio is no structures 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 fixed your website will be your 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 showcase 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.470
 so you will be judged we will you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.450
 feel good about it even if it's 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.179
 arbitrary even if it's not logical 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.649
 it will be like that we will judge your 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.090
 work and who you are 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.360
 we will judge you by this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.430
 intermediate there so be careful 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 do you most internet sites 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.290
 possible soft place to the image you are 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.380
 photographer places to the picture stop the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 Christmas tree sites with motors of 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.470
 things that are flashing in 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.610
 all the senses that looks like nothing you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.799
 do not go for horns anymore 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.799
 that something else is sober 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.370
 do you create a small smaller image 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.140
 mark whether it's your name a name 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 other does not matter but do you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.180
 something fixed of lasting in the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.989
 time that you recognize that it is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.959
 your signature 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.370
 that's super important to your website 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.380
 also hunt for dead links 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.450
 because already in normal times if you 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.310
 have a customer a potential prospect who 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.950
 falls on your site it's already good 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 so if in addition he will click some 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.760
 part and who falls on a dead link there 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.560
 damn it 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.209
 you will be 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 discredit because not only 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.830
 your client your prospect is going to be 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.140
 happy already fallen on will see what 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.730
 you do is up to you to spot 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 parakou already compared to what they 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.140
 fall on your site but if they 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.190
 fall on a tie to death it's like 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.709
 his name says it's dead for you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.700
 if you pay attention to that 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.230
 404 errors all to avoid all that do 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.510
 attention also go to the hunt for 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.440
 spelling mistakes 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.980
 that's something I know it's 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.260
 complicated but have your site re-read 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 or your important mails your 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.220
 important emails by people 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.410
 who know a little about 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.780
 spelling and grammar avoid 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 misspellings that's essential 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.410
 for your image 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.750
 it may seem small details but 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.150
 it's important as soon as you want 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.220
 move upmarket in terms of customers 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.620
 pay attention to all these things 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.940
 another little thing that may seem 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.340
 innocuous but important 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.349
 avoid gmail hotmail email addresses 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.190
 all this do you take a domain name 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.239
 perso a professional domain name 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.140
 bought the domain name that your site 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.549
 on number of models that you 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.950
 fake email address on that same in the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.480
 area that is a total osmosis 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.940
 with this domain name are related 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.269
 with your brand 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.470
 that's really professional it's 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.380
 always small details but it has 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.360
 its importance because to avoid to your 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.400
 prospect to ask questions about 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.830
 you especially the negative questions of the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 style to whom it is then in time 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.840
 he writes us he knows what is his 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.950
 box he writes me if we do not do it 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.940
 relationship between the email address and 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.740
 business 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.680
 it's not good if they ask themselves 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.139
 questions avoid all that so be very 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.060
 homogeneous of course everyone does not have 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.919
 the means from a com agency for 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.270
 have a logo make a mark and everything 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.280
 and all a site that goes with behind 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 but there are free solutions 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.180
 or not expensive at all to do the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.490
 things properly besides good I'm 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.230
 developing a training 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.340
 business in the photo we will not talk about 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.510
 mistakes we speak only business 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.190
 how to get the customer how 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.840

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.100
 of his passion 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.169
 I am working on it and 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.050
 I have a special template developed 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.240
 a wordpress website for the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.950
 photographer for us and this theme played 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.320
 will be incorporated into this training 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.500
 and I will show you step by step how 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.330
 buy a common domain name 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.480
 buy an accommodation at the same time as 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.240
 this domain name and then how does the 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.570
 go up and set it to everything from a to 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.250
 z 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.170
 but I'll tell you a lot 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.180
 later to start in front of them 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.950

 be able to launch it in September 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.980
 something else too once one is 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.090
 launched as a professional and that if 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.530

 humble not take the melon 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.080
 it can be difficult sometimes because 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.300
 some will appreciate your work 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.560
 are you going to praise and we tend 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.380
 also to take the big head 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.150
 so pay attention to that 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.370
 you are not at the head of a 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.410
