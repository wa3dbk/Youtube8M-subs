00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
a couple times and there's some hint of

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.670 
a couple times and there's some hint of
a<00:02:46.890> romance<00:02:47.340> between<00:02:47.580> them<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.690> never<00:02:48.989> did

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
a romance between them but it never did

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.290 
a romance between them but it never did
come<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.040> fruition<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.670> might<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
come to fruition and it might in the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.250 
come to fruition and it might in the
future<00:02:51.410> games<00:02:52.410> are<00:02:52.680> folks<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.810> as<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.140> now

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
future games are folks but as for now

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.449 
future games are folks but as for now
they're<00:02:55.500> very<00:02:55.769> awkward<00:02:56.310> around<00:02:56.610> each<00:02:56.730> other

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
they're very awkward around each other

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.590 
they're very awkward around each other
it's<00:02:59.459> actually<00:02:59.760> pretty<00:02:59.940> funny<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.300> awkward

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
it's actually pretty funny how awkward

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's actually pretty funny how awkward
they<00:03:00.720> are<00:03:01.160> but<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.920> obviously<00:03:04.920> she<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.180> was

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
they are but so obviously she it was

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.210 
they are but so obviously she it was
after<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> Infinity<00:03:07.500> Blade<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:07.769> we<00:03:07.829> don't

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
after the Infinity Blade now we don't

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.009 
after the Infinity Blade now we don't
know<00:03:08.519> why<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> guess<00:03:09.150> she<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.510> thinks<00:03:09.600> his<00:03:09.810> use

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
know why I guess she just thinks his use

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.449 
know why I guess she just thinks his use
it's<00:03:10.620> useful<00:03:12.560> because<00:03:13.560> she<00:03:13.950> does<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.430> about

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
it's useful because she does know about

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's useful because she does know about
the<00:03:14.790> deathless<00:03:15.239> she<00:03:15.420> knows<00:03:15.570> quite<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> bit<00:03:16.079> now

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the deathless she knows quite a bit now

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.960 
the deathless she knows quite a bit now
we<00:03:16.320> don't<00:03:16.680> know<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:16.950> she<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.130> deathless<00:03:17.640> or<00:03:17.820> not

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
we don't know if she is deathless or not

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300 
we don't know if she is deathless or not
that<00:03:18.780> might<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.110> revealed<00:03:19.350> later<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.190> we're

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that might be revealed later but we're

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.590 
that might be revealed later but we're
not<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.610> sure<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:20.970> she's<00:03:21.120> definitely<00:03:21.570> not

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
not really sure if she's definitely not

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.330 
not really sure if she's definitely not
right<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:23.510> she's<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.140> good<00:03:25.530> fighter<00:03:26.070> in

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
right now she's not a good fighter in

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220 
right now she's not a good fighter in
the<00:03:26.489> sense<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.299> Aegis<00:03:27.660> phones<00:03:27.870> which<00:03:28.110> are

the sense of the Aegis phones which are

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.470 
the sense of the Aegis phones which are
the<00:03:28.320> main<00:03:28.500> fighting<00:03:28.950> style<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.090> Infinity

followed the aegis forms they just

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.789 
followed the aegis forms they just
formed<00:03:45.660> they're<00:03:45.780> not<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.380> her<00:03:46.530> she's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
not very good at them which is why I've

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.080 
not very good at them which is why I've
said<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:49.950> previous<00:03:49.980> videos<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.579> don't<00:03:50.640> think

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
said in previous videos I don't think

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.220 
said in previous videos I don't think
we'll<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.239> playing<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:51.660> her<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.900> Infinity

this stresses started quite a lot so I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.120 
this stresses started quite a lot so I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.719 
looks similar to Sadie's staff on upside
now<00:04:31.650> although<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.040> not<00:04:32.130> exactly<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:35.100> we<00:04:35.580> may

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
now although it's not exactly so we may

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.000 
now although it's not exactly so we may
be<00:04:35.790> playing<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.150> her<00:04:36.270> I'm<00:04:36.419> not<00:04:36.570> sure<00:04:37.010> my

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
be playing this her I'm not sure my

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.640 
be playing this her I'm not sure my
personal<00:04:38.910> thing<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.389> well<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:39.930> mean<00:04:40.050> if<00:04:40.350> she<00:04:40.530> is

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
personal thing is well I mean if she is

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.590 
personal thing is well I mean if she is
deathless<00:04:41.130> then<00:04:41.400> we<00:04:42.000> could<00:04:42.210> play<00:04:42.389> as<00:04:42.450> her

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
deathless then we could play as her

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.820 
deathless then we could play as her
because<00:04:42.780> she<00:04:42.900> got<00:04:43.020> open<00:04:43.260> all<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.440> seals<00:04:43.650> but

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
because she got open all the seals but

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.200 
because she got open all the seals but
if<00:04:43.950> she<00:04:44.070> isn't<00:04:44.190> death<00:04:44.430> list<00:04:44.639> and<00:04:44.820> she<00:04:44.970> couldn't

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
if she isn't death list and she couldn't

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.920 
if she isn't death list and she couldn't
really<00:04:45.300> free<00:04:46.139> Syrus<00:04:46.560> from<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> vault<00:04:47.130> because

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
really free Syrus from the vault because

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.390 
really free Syrus from the vault because
you<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.169> die<00:04:49.350> four<00:04:49.680> times<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.190> come<00:04:50.280> back

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
you have to die four times and come back

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.990 
you have to die four times and come back
to<00:04:50.550> life<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:51.389> do<00:04:51.539> that<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.400> she<00:04:53.430> couldn't<00:04:53.880> do

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
to life to do that so she couldn't do

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.060 
to life to do that so she couldn't do
that<00:04:54.120> now<00:04:54.289> if<00:04:55.289> she<00:04:55.470> isn't<00:04:55.590> definitely<00:04:56.010> I'm

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
that now if she isn't definitely I'm

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.159 
that now if she isn't definitely I'm
assuming<00:04:56.400> rager<00:04:56.760> are<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.510> rager<00:04:57.810> iron<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.050> to

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
assuming rager are this rager iron it to

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.330 
assuming rager are this rager iron it to
secret<00:04:58.500> way<00:04:58.620> out<00:04:58.650> of<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.010> vault

secret way out of the vault

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.029 
secret way out of the vault
and<00:04:59.990> he<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.139> come<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.350> Cyrus<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:01.860> we're

and he can come to Cyrus but we're

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.830

ESET in this video I do not think will

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.210 
ESET in this video I do not think will
play<00:05:06.510> sorcery<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.169> actually<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:07.919> know<00:05:08.039> what

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
play sorcery but actually you know what

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.839 
play sorcery but actually you know what
let's<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:09.060> go<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.590> 4951<00:05:10.590> chain<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:13.849> don't

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
let's just go a 4951 chain I don't

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.190 
let's just go a 4951 chain I don't
really<00:05:14.970> know<00:05:15.150> what<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.300> think<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.780> mean<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:16.020> guess

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
really know what I think I mean I guess

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.060 
really know what I think I mean I guess
it's<00:05:16.380> 50/50<00:05:16.919> but<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:19.680> ISA

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
it's 50/50 but so ISA

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.469 
it's 50/50 but so ISA
interesting<00:05:20.639> character<00:05:21.030> we<00:05:21.180> don't<00:05:21.210> know<00:05:21.450> a

interesting character we don't know a
whole<00:05:21.750> lot<00:05:21.810> about<00:05:21.960> her<00:05:23.000> just<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.150> she's<00:05:24.360> an

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
whole lot about her just that she's an

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.690 
whole lot about her just that she's an
assassin<00:05:25.289> kind<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.800> sneak<00:05:26.039> up<00:05:26.190> on<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.490> got

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
assassin kind of sneak up on you got

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.580 
assassin kind of sneak up on you got
kind<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:27.030> guy<00:05:27.210> she<00:05:27.599> is<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:29.150> weathered<00:05:30.380> person<00:05:31.380> in

kind of guy she is a weathered person in

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.230 
kind of guy she is a weathered person in
the<00:05:31.860> newly<00:05:32.370> new<00:05:32.520> person<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:32.849> guess<00:05:33.000> that's<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
the newly new person I guess that's the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.839 
the newly new person I guess that's the
word<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.419> was<00:05:33.479> looking<00:05:33.570> for<00:05:33.780> earlier<00:05:34.190> she<00:05:35.190> has

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
word I was looking for earlier she has

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.180 
word I was looking for earlier she has
been<00:05:36.030> around<00:05:36.210> for<00:05:36.479> a<00:05:36.510> while<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:36.870> knows<00:05:37.190> knows

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
been around for a while and knows knows

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.170 
been around for a while and knows knows
what's<00:05:38.460> up

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
what's up

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.070 
what's up
so<00:05:39.830> he's<00:05:40.830> up<00:05:41.070> not<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.430> lot<00:05:41.639> about<00:05:41.910> her<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:42.780> she

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
so he's up not a lot about her but she
