00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.299 

so<00:00:08.080> far<00:00:08.320> we've<00:00:08.500> been<00:00:08.530> looking<00:00:08.950> at<00:00:09.040> block

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
so far we've been looking at block

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.610 
so far we've been looking at block
printing<00:00:09.760> with<00:00:09.879> one<00:00:10.120> single<00:00:10.629> block<00:00:10.870> now<00:00:11.530> I'd

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
printing with one single block now I'd

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.470 
printing with one single block now I'd
like<00:00:11.740> to<00:00:11.799> move<00:00:12.100> on<00:00:12.309> to<00:00:12.430> actually<00:00:12.879> creating

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
like to move on to actually creating

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.359 
like to move on to actually creating
patterns<00:00:13.690> using<00:00:14.350> two<00:00:14.590> blocks<00:00:14.949> which<00:00:15.190> is

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
patterns using two blocks which is

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.510 
patterns using two blocks which is
called<00:00:15.609> block<00:00:15.879> on<00:00:16.119> block<00:00:16.480> now<00:00:17.260> you<00:00:17.949> guys<00:00:18.189> I've

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
called block on block now you guys I've

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.009 
called block on block now you guys I've
already<00:00:18.820> started<00:00:19.119> this<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.630> something<00:00:19.990> a

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
already started this is something a

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.990 
already started this is something a
piece<00:00:20.199> of<00:00:20.380> fabric<00:00:20.920> that<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.340> printed<00:00:21.789> earlier

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
piece of fabric that you printed earlier

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.210 
piece of fabric that you printed earlier
and<00:00:22.570> we're<00:00:22.960> going<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.200> go<00:00:23.350> back<00:00:23.590> to<00:00:23.620> that<00:00:23.950> piece

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
and we're going to go back to that piece

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.609 
and we're going to go back to that piece
because<00:00:24.640> I<00:00:24.760> don't<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.420> do<00:00:25.600> is<00:00:25.869> actually

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
because I don't you to do is actually

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.400 
because I don't you to do is actually
print<00:00:27.100> a<00:00:27.400> different<00:00:28.240> block<00:00:28.630> on<00:00:28.869> top<00:00:29.140> of<00:00:29.320> the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
print a different block on top of the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.529 
print a different block on top of the
same<00:00:29.619> disc<00:00:29.860> on<00:00:30.070> top<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.550> same<00:00:30.760> design<00:00:31.330> is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
same disc on top of the same design is

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.020 
same disc on top of the same design is
that<00:00:31.630> okay<00:00:31.930> so<00:00:32.500> if<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:32.739> get<00:00:32.949> started<00:00:33.280> now

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
that okay so if you get started now

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.270 
that okay so if you get started now
remember<00:00:34.629> with<00:00:35.079> your<00:00:35.260> second<00:00:35.829> block<00:00:36.250> a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
remember with your second block a

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.810 
remember with your second block a
different<00:00:36.850> block<00:00:37.120> print<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.960> exactly<00:00:38.680> on<00:00:39.070> top

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
different block print it exactly on top

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.710 
different block print it exactly on top
all<00:00:40.180> right

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
all right

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.139 
all right
and<00:00:40.810> because<00:00:41.500> these<00:00:41.800> blocks<00:00:42.399> actually<00:00:42.970> are

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
and because these blocks actually are

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.880 
and because these blocks actually are
the<00:00:43.300> same<00:00:43.540> size<00:00:43.870> they<00:00:44.200> fit<00:00:44.500> very<00:00:44.530> well

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
the same size they fit very well

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.340 
the same size they fit very well
together<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.640> it's<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.120> very<00:00:46.360> easy<00:00:46.660> starting

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
together and it's a very easy starting

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.610 
together and it's a very easy starting
point<00:00:47.710> while<00:00:48.579> you're<00:00:48.760> doing<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.600> shall<00:00:50.079> go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
point while you're doing that I shall go

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.979 
point while you're doing that I shall go
on<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:50.980> showing<00:00:51.399> you<00:00:51.520> exactly<00:00:52.390> what<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.630> mean<00:00:52.780> by

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
on to showing you exactly what I mean by

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.350 
on to showing you exactly what I mean by
block<00:00:53.410> on<00:00:53.620> block<00:00:53.890> I'd<00:00:54.430> like<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.850> show<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.090> how

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
block on block I'd like to show you how

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.229 
block on block I'd like to show you how
he<00:00:55.420> created<00:00:56.020> this<00:00:56.170> new<00:00:56.410> surface<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.760> had<00:00:57.969> this

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
he created this new surface we had this

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.479 
he created this new surface we had this
block<00:00:58.570> here<00:00:58.899> which<00:00:59.260> was<00:00:59.469> printed<00:00:59.770> with<00:01:00.160> blue

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
block here which was printed with blue

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.479 
block here which was printed with blue
all<00:01:00.940> across<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.809> piece<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.200> fabric<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.890> once

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
all across the piece of fabric and once

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.639 
all across the piece of fabric and once
the<00:01:03.760> whole<00:01:03.969> piece<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.449> fabric<00:01:04.659> was<00:01:05.079> covered

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
the whole piece of fabric was covered

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.810 
the whole piece of fabric was covered
we<00:01:06.039> then<00:01:06.310> covered<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.229> block<00:01:08.619> again<00:01:09.549> on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
we then covered the this block again on

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.750 
we then covered the this block again on
top<00:01:10.570> so<00:01:11.200> you've<00:01:11.350> actually<00:01:11.530> got<00:01:11.920> two<00:01:12.310> layers<00:01:12.549> of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
top so you've actually got two layers of

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.940 
top so you've actually got two layers of
different<00:01:13.150> blocks<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.930> different<00:01:14.200> colors<00:01:14.770> on

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
different blocks of different colors on

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.740 
different blocks of different colors on
top<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.400> each<00:01:15.520> other<00:01:15.790> which<00:01:16.299> if<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.600> look

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
top of each other which if you look

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.500 
top of each other which if you look
closely<00:01:17.140> really<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.130> create<00:01:18.549> a<00:01:18.580> very<00:01:18.940> exciting

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
closely really do create a very exciting

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.719 
closely really do create a very exciting
texture<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.780> this<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.710> exactly<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.520> same

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
texture also this is exactly the same

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.880 
texture also this is exactly the same
two<00:01:25.000> blocks<00:01:25.360> but<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.170> creates<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.680> totally

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
two blocks but it creates a totally

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.100 
two blocks but it creates a totally
different<00:01:27.520> look<00:01:27.729> if<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.420> see<00:01:28.630> here<00:01:28.960> we've

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
different look if you see here we've

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.649 
different look if you see here we've
used<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.560> red<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.430> blue<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.909> it's<00:01:31.420> very

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
used the red and the blue and it's very

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.749 
used the red and the blue and it's very
clear<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.140> see<00:01:32.350> how<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.830> two<00:01:33.250> colors<00:01:33.610> have

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
clear to see how the two colors have

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.660 
clear to see how the two colors have
interacted<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.049> two<00:01:35.229> blocks<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:38.670> think

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
interacted and the two blocks I think

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.460 
interacted and the two blocks I think
Rebecca<00:01:39.939> it's<00:01:40.390> just<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.659> matter<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:40.990> trial<00:01:41.320> and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
Rebecca it's just a matter of trial and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.170 
Rebecca it's just a matter of trial and
error<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.920> just<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.220> matter<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:42.520> having<00:01:42.700> fun

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
error it's just a matter of having fun

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.020 
error it's just a matter of having fun
playing<00:01:43.960> with<00:01:44.229> things<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.670> seeing<00:01:45.909> what

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
playing with things and just seeing what

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.660 
playing with things and just seeing what
you<00:01:46.509> actually<00:01:46.780> like<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.590> mean<00:01:47.920> here<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.640> a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you actually like I mean here this is a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.819 
you actually like I mean here this is a
very<00:01:48.939> deliberate<00:01:49.540> complementary<00:01:50.350> color<00:01:50.560> so

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
very deliberate complementary color so

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.340 
very deliberate complementary color so
blue<00:01:51.189> sorry<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.210> beg<00:01:52.390> your<00:01:52.479> pardon<00:01:52.540> purple<00:01:53.229> and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
blue sorry I beg your pardon purple and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.499 
blue sorry I beg your pardon purple and
yellow<00:01:53.530> are<00:01:53.979> complementary<00:01:54.880> colors<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
yellow are complementary colors and

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.560 
yellow are complementary colors and
these<00:01:56.200> really<00:01:56.560> blend<00:01:56.979> in<00:01:57.159> very<00:01:57.189> nicely<00:01:57.670> and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
these really blend in very nicely and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.399 
these really blend in very nicely and
here<00:01:58.930> we've<00:01:59.140> got<00:01:59.380> some<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> first

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
here we've got some this is the first

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.889 
here we've got some this is the first
layer<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.310> block<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.390> see<00:02:04.630> here

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
layer of the block and you can see here

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.200 
layer of the block and you can see here
this<00:02:05.079> was<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.500> block<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.220> used<00:02:06.549> for<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
this was the block that we used for the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.389 
this was the block that we used for the
first<00:02:07.450> layer<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.560> looks<00:02:08.769> quite<00:02:09.039> intricate

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
first layer and it looks quite intricate

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.959 
first layer and it looks quite intricate
and<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.909> very<00:02:10.119> detailed<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.670> hold

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
and it's very detailed so I just hold

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.240 
and it's very detailed so I just hold
that<00:02:13.059> for<00:02:13.389> you<00:02:13.419> can<00:02:13.779> see<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.379> clearly

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that for you can see that very clearly

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.960 
that for you can see that very clearly
and<00:02:16.340> then<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.090> got<00:02:17.270> another<00:02:17.690> block<00:02:18.050> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and then we got another block and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.000 
and then we got another block and
printed<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.120> top<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.800> how

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
printed on top of it and can you see how

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.040 
printed on top of it and can you see how
that's<00:02:22.220> created<00:02:22.760> more<00:02:23.030> depth<00:02:23.330> more<00:02:23.720> layers

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's created more depth more layers

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.280 
that's created more depth more layers
and<00:02:24.470> more<00:02:24.980> intrigue<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.180> personally<00:02:27.050> think

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
and more intrigue so I personally think

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.680 
and more intrigue so I personally think
that<00:02:27.440> once<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.920> get<00:02:28.100> involved<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.970> block<00:02:29.510> on

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
that once you get involved in block on

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.410 
that once you get involved in block on
block<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.260> finding<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.520> combination<00:02:32.330> of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
block and finding the combination of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.449 
block and finding the combination of
blocks<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.080> really<00:02:33.440> love<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.250> can

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
blocks that you really love you can

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
blocks that you really love you can
create<00:02:34.700> some<00:02:34.970> absolutely<00:02:35.720> beautiful<00:02:35.840> things

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
create some absolutely beautiful things

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.670 
create some absolutely beautiful things
and<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.430> total<00:02:38.000> contrast<00:02:38.510> there's<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.990> bag<00:02:39.260> here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
and in total contrast there's a bag here

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.970 
and in total contrast there's a bag here
that<00:02:40.340> we've<00:02:40.670> used<00:02:40.940> two<00:02:41.330> blocks<00:02:41.660> these<00:02:42.560> two

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
that we've used two blocks these two

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.940 
that we've used two blocks these two
here<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.720> see<00:02:44.930> those<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.590> that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
here so can you see those there's that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.370 
here so can you see those there's that
block<00:02:46.250> there<00:02:46.610> we've<00:02:46.940> used<00:02:47.240> for<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> pink<00:02:48.080> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
block there we've used for the pink and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.800 
block there we've used for the pink and
this<00:02:49.100> block<00:02:49.459> here<00:02:49.760> we've<00:02:50.060> used<00:02:50.300> for<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> blue

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
this block here we've used for the blue

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.810 
this block here we've used for the blue
and<00:02:51.140> they're<00:02:51.530> not<00:02:51.709> actually<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.220> top<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.700> each

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
and they're not actually on top of each

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.270 
and they're not actually on top of each
other<00:02:52.970> exactly<00:02:53.420> they're<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.320> slightly<00:02:54.590> sort

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
other exactly they're just slightly sort

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.570 
other exactly they're just slightly sort
of<00:02:55.400> freestyle<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.110> even<00:02:57.500> freestyle<00:02:58.190> works

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
of freestyle and so even freestyle works

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.630 
of freestyle and so even freestyle works
very<00:02:58.940> well<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.480> block<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.870> block<00:03:00.640> so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
very well with the block on block so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910 
very well with the block on block so
again<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.900> block<00:03:03.170> on<00:03:03.320> block<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.739> can

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
again with this block on block you can

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.010 
again with this block on block you can
apply<00:03:04.220> whatever<00:03:04.790> rules<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.480> like<00:03:05.660> all<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
apply whatever rules you like all the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.020 
apply whatever rules you like all the
walls<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.380> we've<00:03:06.590> learnt<00:03:06.860> about<00:03:07.130> rows<00:03:07.610> and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
walls that we've learnt about rows and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.699 
walls that we've learnt about rows and
rotation<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.959> thing<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.560> actually

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
rotation and all that thing can actually

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.520 
rotation and all that thing can actually
be<00:03:10.220> used<00:03:10.550> with<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:11.930> again<00:03:12.110> with

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
be used with this but again with

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.960 
be used with this but again with
different<00:03:12.680> blocks<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.400> create<00:03:13.760> different

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
different blocks to create different

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.020 
different blocks to create different
stunning<00:03:14.660> effects<00:03:15.340> one<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.580> techniques

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
stunning effects one of the techniques

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.790 
stunning effects one of the techniques
that<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.270> particularly<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.500> bread

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
that I particularly like is this bread

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.789 
that I particularly like is this bread
basket<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.750> working<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> three

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
basket and working on a three

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.220 
basket and working on a three
dimensional<00:03:22.430> object<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.030> actually<00:03:23.720> I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
dimensional object and actually I

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.990 
dimensional object and actually I
present<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.830> with<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> bit<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.730> challenge

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
present you with a bit of a challenge

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.270 
present you with a bit of a challenge
sometimes<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.380> if<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.620> look<00:03:27.799> at<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.070> block

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
sometimes so if you look at this block

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.600 
sometimes so if you look at this block
here<00:03:28.900> we've<00:03:29.900> got<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.350> block<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.430> can

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
here we've got this block and you can

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.820 
here we've got this block and you can
see<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.570> we've<00:03:32.780> actually<00:03:32.959> created<00:03:33.350> this

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
see that we've actually created this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.400 
see that we've actually created this
bread<00:03:34.160> basket<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:35.180> obviously<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.660> can<00:03:35.959> imagine

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
bread basket but obviously I can imagine

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.750 
bread basket but obviously I can imagine
looking<00:03:36.590> at<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.070> think<00:03:37.100> well<00:03:37.430> how<00:03:37.610> on

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
looking at it you think well how on

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.670 
looking at it you think well how on
earth<00:03:37.970> do<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.239> get<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> neat<00:03:38.780> impression<00:03:39.470> of

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
earth do you get a neat impression of

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.759 
earth do you get a neat impression of
this<00:03:40.340> block<00:03:40.670> printing<00:03:41.209> when<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.170> actually

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
this block printing when it's actually

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.370 
this block printing when it's actually
very<00:03:42.920> difficult<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.850> actually<00:03:44.480> get<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.049> flat

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
very difficult to actually get a flat

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.710 
very difficult to actually get a flat
surface<00:03:45.680> well<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.700> actual<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.239> technique

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
surface well the actual the technique

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.069 
surface well the actual the technique
for<00:03:47.989> using<00:03:48.470> those<00:03:48.620> two<00:03:48.950> blocks<00:03:49.220> together

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
for using those two blocks together

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.259 
for using those two blocks together
would<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.230> course<00:03:51.470> be<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:52.489> create<00:03:52.880> something

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
would of course be to create something

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.870 
would of course be to create something
flat<00:03:53.810> first<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.410> what<00:03:54.590> we<00:03:54.890> would<00:03:55.250> suggest<00:03:55.459> you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
flat first so what we would suggest you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.030 
flat first so what we would suggest you
do<00:03:56.060> is<00:03:56.329> if<00:03:56.900> you're<00:03:57.049> making<00:03:57.410> something<00:03:57.680> like<00:03:58.010> a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
do is if you're making something like a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.180 
do is if you're making something like a
bread<00:03:58.400> basket<00:03:58.640> then<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.230> assemble<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.160> whole

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
bread basket then you assemble the whole

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.910 
bread basket then you assemble the whole
thing<00:04:01.640> first<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.360> then<00:04:03.200> once<00:04:03.470> you've<00:04:03.709> got<00:04:03.890> a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
thing first and then once you've got a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.699 
thing first and then once you've got a
nice<00:04:04.299> completed<00:04:05.299> item<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.380> love<00:04:06.590> it

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
nice completed item if you love it

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.650 
nice completed item if you love it
obviously<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.190> can<00:04:07.340> keep<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:07.730> this<00:04:07.880> but

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
obviously you can keep it like this but

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.650 
obviously you can keep it like this but
I<00:04:08.720> would<00:04:09.110> then<00:04:09.380> use<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.880> actually<00:04:11.299> block

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
I would then use this and actually block

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.229 
I would then use this and actually block
print<00:04:11.989> directly<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.459> idea<00:04:13.850> with<00:04:14.030> these

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
print directly and the idea with these

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.099 
print directly and the idea with these
is<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.840> actually<00:04:15.489> select<00:04:16.570> certain<00:04:17.570> areas<00:04:18.079> that

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
is to actually select certain areas that

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.349 
is to actually select certain areas that
you<00:04:18.410> want<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.769> blob<00:04:19.010> print<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.640> it<00:04:20.090> may<00:04:20.299> be

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
you want to blob print and it may be

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.680 
you want to blob print and it may be
that<00:04:20.630> some<00:04:20.900> areas<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.350> leave<00:04:21.709> plain<00:04:22.570> with<00:04:23.570> the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
that some areas you leave plain with the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.560 
that some areas you leave plain with the
two<00:04:23.870> different<00:04:24.260> blocks<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.039> with<00:04:25.880> some<00:04:26.120> areas

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
two different blocks and with some areas

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.960 
two different blocks and with some areas
you<00:04:27.050> might<00:04:27.229> have<00:04:27.470> them<00:04:27.650> overlapping<00:04:28.130> it's

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
you might have them overlapping it's

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.390 
you might have them overlapping it's
come

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
come

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.320 
come
lately<00:04:29.520> up<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.889> there's<00:04:31.889> another

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
lately up to you there's another

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.820 
lately up to you there's another
technique<00:04:33.330> here<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.500> background

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
technique here this is this background

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.430 
technique here this is this background
fabric<00:04:35.370> was<00:04:36.120> actually<00:04:36.509> our<00:04:36.630> serendipity

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
fabric was actually our serendipity

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.860 
fabric was actually our serendipity
cloth<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.009> had<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.570> we've<00:04:39.570> used

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
cloth that we had and we've used

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.439 
cloth that we had and we've used
slightly<00:04:40.470> overlapping<00:04:41.250> block<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.880> block<00:04:42.150> and

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
slightly overlapping block on block and

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.960 
slightly overlapping block on block and
that<00:04:42.870> worked<00:04:43.110> very<00:04:43.500> well<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.370> bag<00:04:44.669> has

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that worked very well and this bag has

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
that worked very well and this bag has
been<00:04:45.000> made<00:04:45.389> with<00:04:45.870> some<00:04:46.320> lined<00:04:46.740> with<00:04:47.039> some

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
been made with some lined with some

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.140 
been made with some lined with some
wadding<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:47.850> then<00:04:48.690> done<00:04:49.080> some<00:04:49.880> quilting<00:04:50.880> with

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
wadding and then done some quilting with

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.540 
wadding and then done some quilting with
some<00:04:51.360> gold<00:04:51.600> thread<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.199> I<00:04:52.590> think<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:53.100> really

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
some gold thread and I think that really

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.719 
some gold thread and I think that really
really<00:04:53.970> works<00:04:54.300> nicely<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.289> there's<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.220> sort

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
really works nicely and there's a sort

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.370 
really works nicely and there's a sort
of<00:04:56.789> nice<00:04:57.139> coordinating<00:04:58.139> inside<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.870> let's<00:05:01.199> see

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
of nice coordinating inside so let's see

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.900 
of nice coordinating inside so let's see
how<00:05:01.530> you've<00:05:01.680> been<00:05:01.800> getting<00:05:02.130> on<00:05:02.280> how<00:05:02.520> has<00:05:02.880> it

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
how you've been getting on how has it

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.080 
how you've been getting on how has it
been<00:05:03.090> going<00:05:03.240> Rebecca<00:05:03.750> it's<00:05:04.410> been<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.860> fine

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
been going Rebecca it's been going fine

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.490 
been going Rebecca it's been going fine
would<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.120> like<00:05:06.389> to<00:05:06.570> explain<00:05:06.870> what<00:05:07.169> you've

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
would you like to explain what you've

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.129 
would you like to explain what you've
got<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:08.340> first<00:05:08.729> row<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.150> really<00:05:09.479> interesting

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
got that first row is really interesting

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.840 
got that first row is really interesting
can<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.380> explain<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.039> three<00:05:11.400> different

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
can you explain the three different

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.360 
can you explain the three different
stages<00:05:12.120> you've<00:05:12.479> got<00:05:12.660> there<00:05:12.870> well<00:05:13.500> basically<00:05:14.010> I

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
stages you've got there well basically I

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.909 
stages you've got there well basically I
left<00:05:14.760> two<00:05:15.060> open<00:05:15.690> because<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.229> had<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.380> gap<00:05:16.620> there

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
left two open because I had a gap there

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.430 
left two open because I had a gap there
so<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.220> printed<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.940> pink<00:05:18.180> one<00:05:18.389> there<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:19.229> that

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
so I printed the pink one there so that

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.740 
so I printed the pink one there so that
it<00:05:19.680> shows<00:05:19.949> you<00:05:20.310> which<00:05:20.490> blocks<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:21.120> used<00:05:21.479> and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
it shows you which blocks I used and

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.010 
it shows you which blocks I used and
then<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.500> just<00:05:22.770> went<00:05:22.919> around<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.669> printed<00:05:24.479> like

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
then I just went around and printed like

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.290 
then I just went around and printed like
the<00:05:25.440> pink<00:05:25.860> onto<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> green<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.760> think<00:05:27.150> that's

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
the pink onto the green I think that's

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.029 
the pink onto the green I think that's
lovely<00:05:27.599> when<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.930> carry<00:05:28.199> on<00:05:28.410> finishing<00:05:28.770> that

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
lovely when you carry on finishing that

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.129 
lovely when you carry on finishing that
that's<00:05:29.400> really<00:05:29.759> lovely<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.539> I<00:05:30.630> think<00:05:30.900> yours

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
well I quite like that there aren't any

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.779 
well I quite like that there aren't any
hard<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.840> fast<00:05:36.930> rules<00:05:37.590> about<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:38.220> particular

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
hard and fast rules about a particular

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.020 
hard and fast rules about a particular
type<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.240> block<00:05:39.570> that<00:05:39.840> you've<00:05:40.080> used<00:05:40.940> so<00:05:41.940> you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
type of block that you've used so you

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.029 
type of block that you've used so you
can<00:05:42.150> use<00:05:42.300> larger<00:05:42.570> blocks<00:05:43.050> or<00:05:43.320> smaller<00:05:43.710> blocks

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
can use larger blocks or smaller blocks

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.560 
can use larger blocks or smaller blocks
on<00:05:44.220> top<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.669> original<00:05:45.090> print<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.510> they

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
on top of the original print and they

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.629 
on top of the original print and they
still<00:05:45.840> come<00:05:46.020> out<00:05:46.110> looking<00:05:46.470> quite<00:05:46.710> quite<00:05:47.430> nice

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
still come out looking quite quite nice

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.610 
still come out looking quite quite nice
not<00:05:48.000> only<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.270> way<00:05:48.389> they<00:05:48.630> kind<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.990> interlock

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
not only the way they kind of interlock

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.529 
not only the way they kind of interlock
almost<00:05:50.070> relate<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.639> each<00:05:50.760> other<00:05:51.000> isn't<00:05:51.210> it<00:05:51.389> I

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
almost relate to each other isn't it I

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.029 
almost relate to each other isn't it I
think<00:05:51.750> it's<00:05:51.870> because<00:05:52.199> they're<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.470> same<00:05:52.680> size

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039
