00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:12.599
 special and also super modern and 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.599
 glamorous so let's go there 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 good 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.759
 or what I am was chan we are here in a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
 review chapter of the sims 4 and how 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.180
 you can see let's do a review of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.769
 these furniture that are very very cool 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 because they are cool and can help 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.119
 Put cool atmosphere in your house and 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.129
 be with the furniture that is next to or 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.140
 with this if you realize this is a 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.970
 bed base how it works simply 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.440
 you have to earn any bed 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.110
 that you like, they go to this 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.079
 part of here they look for what is comfort 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.269
 will arrive imagine a bed as per 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.460
 example this bed does not say anything then to me 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.320
 I like I do not like it, it 's just the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.510
 you put up and you already have what is 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 bright base and he put it I want a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.189
 that is matrimonial then simply 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.989
 You grab this bed and also put it on 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.900
 the top part and so you have your bed 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.670
 with a very cool shiny base to 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.860
 I especially like how it looks 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.630
 at the same time it looks great because it can 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.400
 help you light up the house so 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.930
 you have to use lots of lights 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.670
 around to be able to achieve 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.430
 illuminate the house and good once 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.840
 you have your ornament well placed below your 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.579
 bed just what you are going to do is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.590
 try what is the bed and come to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.880
 Sleep like any other wanda bed and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.430
 so we can tell our good eyesight 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.440
 seriousness our good age that you have 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.270
 the beds normally as they could 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.310
 do at any time so good 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.290
 We can also see how 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.300
 build if we come here and you 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 we give what is the r we can change 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.140
 what are the colors we have several 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.790
 colors that put not only one single 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
 we can put pink if you want for the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.630
 women or if you want to put a white the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.250
 white looks very elegant seriously this 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 white I recommend it for a house 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.800
 very very elegant very minimalist and very 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.690
 very formal I do not know very father and this if you 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.430
 they like more bright colors or more 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.290
 party-goers can use the red to me it 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.640
 It also makes me elegant but to the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.500
 Maybe it can be a bit violent 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.720
 to rest so I would recommend 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.220
 more colors claritos and of plane for what 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.890
 that is the bed to me I love more what 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.520
 white and good what term can we put 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.110
 green to match what is the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.489
 top mattress good 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.870
 obviously if you want to change 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.430
 also what is the color of the bed already 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.110
 it's up to you guys doing your 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.360
 own combinations and a bed remains 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.860

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.390
 this furniture we can also 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.150
 change the color that you want and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.170
 these are basically nightstands 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.880
 auxiliaries so they can put 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.620
 any type of ornament above without 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640
 no problem like the charly boat 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.770

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.560

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 you want up and now comes the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.810
 part of comfort we can see that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.550

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.150
 sad because sometimes the

 head of crazy ideas or that is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.500

 how do you use what is this super 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.560
 chair 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.730
 the truth is that as an ornament they look 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.140
 great and can use them in 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.150
 any part of the house and now 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.980
 we are in the part of surfaces 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.690
 we can see that we have several tables 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.940
 different style that is where you 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.800
 can put what are small objects 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.780
 you can put this table do not put together a table 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.970
 of good wall sticks of those that are 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.710
 we stuck to the wall table 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.170
 coffee I like a second that can be 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.580
 coffee and a table to decorate what is 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.020
 the living room all that are tables are 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.640
 surfaces that you can use 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.380
 to put any object or to 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.700
 use or to eat so this thing what 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.590
 you can use in this part of here 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.620
 also if you want to be able to put 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.850
 accessories to be able to put a 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.890
 lunch if you want any 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.660
 that kind of thing and finally like 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.490
 can see we have these accessories that 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.780
 they are for the wall and there also as 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.820
 you can see we can put 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.410
 any accessory to be able to decorate 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.550
 that part of there so let's put it 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.290
 for example to be able 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.510
 shoes here if you want 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.190
 put some toothbrushes here or 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.530
 Finally if you want to put whatever 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.720
 one of these things for here and good 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.400
 for it can not be this less interesting 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.810
 you have to put these little objects that 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.520
 they also serve a lot to donate what 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.860
 they are rooms also adorn are 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.330
 mini decoration cubes to put 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.800
 where you want and how can 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.690
 see also can put any type 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.220
 of color to make it beautiful once 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.960
 I had these cubes in real life 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.820
 and they are very beautiful to decorate what 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.100
 are any site that does not have 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.330
 bright accessories and good if you want 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.770
 put these ornaments also here in the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 part above can put it as 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.770
 collectables because sometimes you see 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.280
 great where is where is another job 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.920
 that has disappeared but it does not matter 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.630
 since we are in super tension hair 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.490
 blue as you can see here 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.010
 we have our mode in action we are going to 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.020
 can use it anywhere to 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.090
 can you enchulate any quote from 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.590
 way that we say I like it to look 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.570
 a little more they acted so I like 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.160
 much how this mode looks and how 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.230
 you can see or obviously 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.120
 see much better at night and here in this 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.460
 part of here we have put what is this 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.530
 bar for super and bright we have 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.230
 combined with these extra things 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.090
 for because it will be a beverage site 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.950
 much more fun sometimes than me in 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.480
 action I love how it looks and in fact 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.880
 third but only you know that it is a 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.770
 night place to be able to come out 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.600
 and it's more classic but changing it with 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.610
 this mode and putting these lights 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.830
 special the truth that you see much more 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.570
 modern much more youthful and to me 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.490
 They love to see sincerely how it looks 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.350
 now so it's up to you as what 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.479
 note that the truth is that it has 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.310
 a super modern super modern touch and 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.960
 I'm actually super futuristic too 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.610
 if they want to give that touch also 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.169
 the great and I tell you with this 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.090
 combination the bar looks super 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.860
 spectacular and you can put are 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.840
 making a report because I do not see 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.810
 chandeck something are doing sport in 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.910
 full presentation of a mod 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.169
 and there you can see how it looks 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.970
 Once it looks great they can put 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.320
 any color that you want to me 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.330
 this was the combination of colors that 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.850
 I liked the most for what this center is 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.500
 of nighttime fun you can 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.270

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.590
 special in zero I recommend them a 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.330
 I 'm going to put it down 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.560
 the link in the description and remember that 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.090
 you are going to keep bringing content 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.710

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.389

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.160
 to all the people that can not be followed 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.169
 buying content that will help them 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.580
 with the crushes get more sites 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.229

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.210
