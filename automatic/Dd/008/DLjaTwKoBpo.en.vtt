that regeneration process actually slows
way<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.270> happens<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
way down and so what happens is that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
way down and so what happens is that
instead<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.190> new<00:01:02.399> cells<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.910> coming<00:01:03.359> up

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.190 
instead of the new cells just coming up
and<00:01:03.989> shelling<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> old<00:01:05.430> cells<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> new

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and shelling off the old cells the new

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.609 
and shelling off the old cells the new
skin<00:01:07.439> cells<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:09.060> sweet<00:01:09.330> time

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619

older skin cells are just sitting there

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
older skin cells are just sitting there
