00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.770
 and there are three of this here the subject of this 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.139
 of racism 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.179
 if I would also lead to another rafa topic 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.089
 what of fiction entering the stadium 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.070
 you who are the journalists with more 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.770
 experience at this time director 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 of a medium should be given publicity 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.010
 to this or as means we do not 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.990
 we are but it is not that consignment but 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.360
 we are not motivating them to follow 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.420
 entering more because the TV does not 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.120
 it takes not we keep replicating 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.550
 Well, I think it could be a debate if 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.289
 you get to give this continuously 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.559
 so far it has not been common 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.179
 which may border to be determined by 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.399
 part of the media especially the 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.260
 television stations not the television stations that are 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.110
 broadcasting live matches that 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.780
 maybe censor or hide that kind of 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.180
 takes to not generate this that says Luis 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.909
 then it will be a matter of a medium 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.710
 journalistic web printed by us 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.539
 that we do not have rights of their parties 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.789
 consign the fact because it is something 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.550
 journalistic I do not think that that 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.909
 have to hide if I understand the subject of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.479
 that the live broadcast maybe as it has 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.850
 happened in others so that the world 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.420
 stipulated but when it happened some 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.690
 all of that immediately do not replicate it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.300
 but in the end rafa 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.930
 we consign it seems it is but if I want 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.470
 but in the end it can happen again 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.440
 of happening again and the way to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 prevent it from happening again is 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.090
 Obviously there is more security than 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.830
 there is more control that is punished too 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.660
 these kids that are left I do not know if 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.690
 we have image or only censorship t no no 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:58.250
 not if we have it in an easier and more 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:04.130
 important the issue of racism are two 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.130
 parts you are the head of the program 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.830
 is this boy with the shirt 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.330
 yellow gets one person from 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 security is going to die and in that very 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.980
 he quietly begs him practically to 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 ronaldinho who is baffled 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 when it comes to him obviously what 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.280
 first thing that makes this scare clear no 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.920
 you know with what intention they can go and you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.990
 begs to sign in a line access to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
 sign you do not know what will be put but 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.280
 this is what Luis said 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.920
 obviously to this boy I do not know 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.160
 if applicable even in those cases, not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.520
 I know I do not know who will say that bad 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:55.140
 wave is that he reads that the garment is removed 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:55.140
 even it's not good because I would say that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.100
 we also pay for 30 pesos 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.830
 for example in the USA that has passed many 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.430
 times in national team games 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.380
 who gets in and the security people but 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.830
 they grab them like the worst criminals 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.480
 The world go straight to jail them 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.940
 they love to pay a fine and so on 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.530
 etc 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.930
 that issue is not to be seen if that is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.970
 giving continuously the great figure 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.910
 that ronaldinho the magnet that represents 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.610
 for a good generation of young people 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.010
 still that they saw him encumbrados del 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.500
 Barcelona obviously can 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.970
 this will have to be more aware of 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.950
 any way in the field of 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.689
 vigilance because you never know if you 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.360
 can bring a crazy humanity 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.069
 who wants to do something balanced or what 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.280
 that you want to show off also but 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.280
 good
