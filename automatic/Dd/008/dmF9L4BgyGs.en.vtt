kids this is probably the easiest branch
of<00:01:46.350> contest<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.100> participated<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> if

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
of contest that we participated in so if

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
of contest that we participated in so if
the<00:01:50.579> coaches<00:01:50.820> had<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> put<00:01:51.360> their<00:01:51.479> name<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the coaches had to put their name and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.340 
the coaches had to put their name and
address<00:01:52.399> reason<00:01:53.399> why<00:01:53.670> their<00:01:54.570> team<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.229> their

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
address reason why their team or their

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.910 
address reason why their team or their
organization<00:01:56.219> should<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:57.149> considered<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
organization should be considered and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
organization should be considered and
select<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.040> age<00:01:59.189> group<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.790> coach<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
select an age group that they coach and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
select an age group that they coach and
that<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.990> application<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.670> very

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that was the application so it was very

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.240 
that was the application so it was very
simple<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.659> probably<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
simple and that's probably one with the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
simple and that's probably one with the
main<00:02:05.430> reasons<00:02:05.820> why<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.240> many<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.509> coaches

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
main reasons why so many of the coaches

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.649 
main reasons why so many of the coaches
and<00:02:07.079> teams

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
and teams

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.100
