00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 I represent the company 3 9 not engaged 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 3d printer development and production 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:19.490
 3d printer development project 3 9 released 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 from another project we developed 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 wearable device project was called one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.010
 it still exists continues 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.160
 him work but at some point we 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.649
 faced with difficulties 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 to develop prototyping here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.510
 This device needed 3d 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.430
 the printer looked at normal prices 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.840
 3d printers that could give out 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.770
 angela and on quality 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.559
 we realized that not for a startup these prices 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.500
 it's very hard hundreds of thousands pay for 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.129
 one 3d printer was therefore taken 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.230
 the decision to make vader costs money 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.140
 developed a 3d printer got a very 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 good print quality result by 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 cost of printing I realized that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.810
 3d printer does not cost as much as bevel 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.390
 they ask for him and decide why we if 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 we can do it if we do it we donâ€™t 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.010
 can we 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 make available 3d printer we decided 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 release our printer all born so 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.880
 project 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.990
 the team we have is clear as a constructor 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.900
 the developer is a very good advertiser and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.450
 public relations man 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.100
 which represents our project 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.060
 Catherine is a good specialist in 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.430
 electronics 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.830
 pro can not say that he devised 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.460
 atomic power station electronics 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.119
 including this electronics to eliminate 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.920
 effects of accidents on all 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.670
 one of these electronic engineers he is involved 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.880
 Our site works in the development of 3d 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.830
 the printer took into account the following parameter 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.229
 this print quality should 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.550
 fit most modern 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.600
 3d printers its dimensions should 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.390
 let calm 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 on the desktop or home table then 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.770
 have it should be enough 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.470
 compact and for the price it should be 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.390
 accessible to most people 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.280
 firmware that is installed 3d printer 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.650
 done so the printer itself 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.570
 tune the moment it is turned on 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 really enough to put the ambassador 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.820
 you turn on select model and run 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.220
 print all no settings no what 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.630
 Does the brow on what he does not require 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.900
 the field of printing is able and 180 it 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.180
 diameter of the table and 200 height scream 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.549
 due to its construction quality 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.720
 making precision math 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.239
 calculations special software 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.269
 to ensure 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:57.980
 we managed to reach print speeds up 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:01.549
 200 50 meters per second and accuracy 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.489
 positioning accurate repetition 0 0 1 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.200
 millimeter that is you can type very and 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.400
 very high quality parts 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 standard print modes are from 0 0 5 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.760
 millimeters layer height and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 to 0 3 0 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.890
 i.e. a wide enough range 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.299
 print can be received 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.510
 how quickly parts lower quality 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.310
 increasing the height of the layer and very throats 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.079
 very almost completely 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.890
 corresponding to what should 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:40.269
 turn out to be original on low layers 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.200
 2005 using this 3d printer you can 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.150
 print almost all these details 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.700
 that surround us in everyday life which 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.540
 from plastic from some other 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.480
 of materials 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.109
 besides this 3d printer 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.840
 use for learning like children 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:02.069
 3D modeling some development 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 prototyping 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.690
 making the development of childhood creativity 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.569
 so already a professional can 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.970
 use your work in the printer 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.889
 Prints a lot of very 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.070
 lots of comparison material 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.769
 with analogs it was also one of those 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.530
 criteria that we relied on when 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.419
 so now they designed the printer 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.229
 supports printing as standard 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.289
 types of plastic abs and wood 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:38.729
 plastic containing aluminum plastic 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:41.289
 lectures rubber glass not he flew and 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.570
 most of all available materials 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.539
 currently on the market 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.120
 in fact this is not pure wood this 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:54.550
 Naturally this plastic is the most common but 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.930
 in the filament so called that material 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.180
 fifty years old printer 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.310
 contains 40 percent wooden 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.960
 specially prepared chips 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.169
 very small wooden sections 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.090
 Naturally when printing very much 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:13.210
 nice lasting smell of wood 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.610
 texture of the textures also on 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.370
 background 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.919
 wood can do very good 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.530
 cool design stuff already have 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:26.210
 we and we are testing and successfully 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.599
 plastic which contains aluminum and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.639
 Our plastic suppliers reported that 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.389
 he managed to develop the material 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.000
 which contains 80 percent aluminum 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.930
 details she not only looks like 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.990
 aluminum 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.000
 she and by weight it turns out enough 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:49.879
 heavy and this details can be milled 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.759
 drill to grind well and most 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.729
 aluminum properties about him will remain 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.759
 items at home from the towel 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.800
 door handle holder 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.300
 food pens holders for smartphones and 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.330
 tablets on the table 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.319
 phone cases that is anything 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.419
 even toys for children, that is, if you go to 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.419
 Internet to the corresponding site is 3d 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.409
 modeling there is a huge amount 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.509
 models like 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.509
 robots to build and become children who 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.909
 addicted to robotics fit well and 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.889
 some kind of moving toys 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.430
 which in store can cost there 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:31.419
 thousand tens of thousands of rubles he is not 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.580
 available 10 thought so unspoken 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.469
 wish my personal wish to 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.280
 3d printer became available as 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:42.440
 who has no microwave 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.150
 we have almost every home also 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.150
 it is possible to make a 3d printer
