hi welcome back to educator calm this is
the<00:00:03.030> lesson<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.510> digestive<00:00:04.020> system

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
the lesson on the digestive system

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.280 
the lesson on the digestive system
functions<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> digestive<00:00:07.230> system

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
functions of the digestive system

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.540 
functions of the digestive system
include<00:00:08.240> ingestion<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:10.110> act<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.559> physically

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
include ingestion the act of physically

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.799 
include ingestion the act of physically
putting<00:00:11.910> food<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.509> your<00:00:12.599> mouth

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
putting food into your mouth

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.070 
putting food into your mouth
that's<00:00:13.530> ingesting<00:00:14.630> mechanical<00:00:15.630> breakdown

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that's ingesting mechanical breakdown

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650 
that's ingesting mechanical breakdown
starts<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> mouth<00:00:16.980> that's<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
starts in the mouth that's with the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.290 
starts in the mouth that's with the
teeth<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> tongue<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> swallow

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
teeth with the tongue when you swallow

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
teeth with the tongue when you swallow
food<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:22.050> stomach<00:00:22.500> does<00:00:22.680> mechanical

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
food your stomach does mechanical

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.900 
food your stomach does mechanical
digestion

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
digestion

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.950 
digestion
that's<00:00:24.150> anytime<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:25.439> ripping<00:00:26.279> tearing

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
that's anytime you're ripping tearing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.220 
that's anytime you're ripping tearing
crushing<00:00:27.960> food<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.550> physical

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
crushing food so that's the physical

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.940 
crushing food so that's the physical
breakdown<00:00:32.120> digestion<00:00:33.290> itself<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.649> look<00:00:34.800> at

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
breakdown digestion itself if we look at

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.420 
breakdown digestion itself if we look at
like<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.370> causes<00:00:35.880> digestion<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.540> occur

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
like what causes digestion to occur

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.680 
like what causes digestion to occur
mechanical<00:00:38.430> breakdown<00:00:38.850> does<00:00:39.059> assist<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
mechanical breakdown does assist with it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.139 
mechanical breakdown does assist with it
but<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> microscopic<00:00:40.829> level<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but on a microscopic level it's the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.270 
but on a microscopic level it's the
chemical<00:00:42.660> breakdown<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.980> gets

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
chemical breakdown that that really gets

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.930 
chemical breakdown that that really gets
it<00:00:44.430> done<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:45.300> enzymes<00:00:46.070> acids<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.550> those

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it done that's enzymes acids all those

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
it done that's enzymes acids all those
molecules<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.200> physically<00:00:49.770> break

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
molecules that that physically break

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.970

twisty turny or really long but all of
these<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> sequence

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
these are in sequence

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
these are in sequence
later<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.600> I'll<00:02:06.780> cover<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> accessory<00:02:07.770> organs

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
later on I'll cover the accessory organs

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.949 
later on I'll cover the accessory organs
that<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.489> off<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> side<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> track

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that are off to the side of the track

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
that are off to the side of the track
like<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> liver<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.760> pan

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
like the liver and the pan

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.630 
like the liver and the pan
crius<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.860> course<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> starts<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
crius so of course it starts with the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.270 
crius so of course it starts with the
mouth<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.690> swallow<00:02:16.110> food<00:02:16.500> goes<00:02:16.860> down<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
mouth you swallow food goes down the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.750 
mouth you swallow food goes down the
pharynx<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
pharynx right in here and then into the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
pharynx right in here and then into the
esophagus<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.959> goes<00:02:22.170> down<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
esophagus if it goes down into the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.280 
esophagus if it goes down into the
larynx<00:02:23.610> trachea<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> problem<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
larynx trachea you have a problem and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
larynx trachea you have a problem and
you<00:02:25.380> could<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.860> choking<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.640> aspirating<00:02:27.569> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
you could be choking or aspirating and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.210 
you could be choking or aspirating and
then<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.080> no<00:02:28.230> good

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
then that's no good

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
then that's no good
once<00:02:29.760> food<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.300> liquids<00:02:30.599> go<00:02:30.750> down<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
once food and liquids go down the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.290 
once food and liquids go down the
esophagus<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.980> enter<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> stomach<00:02:32.819> from

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
esophagus they enter the stomach from

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
esophagus they enter the stomach from
the<00:02:33.480> stomach<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.080> go<00:02:34.200> through<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> small

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the stomach we go through the small

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.930 
the stomach we go through the small
intestine<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.660> longest<00:02:37.230> portion

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
of width not length which is right here

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.650 
of width not length which is right here
most<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.489> known<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.790> colon<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
most of it is known as the colon and

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.259 
most of it is known as the colon and
then<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.799> get<00:02:49.950> into<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> rectum<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
then you get into the rectum and the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.860 
then you get into the rectum and the
anus<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> we're<00:02:54.120> gonna<00:02:54.209> start<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> oral

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
anus so we're gonna start with the oral

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.900 
anus so we're gonna start with the oral
cavity<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.440> mouth<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.870> starting<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> the

cavity the mouth the the starting of the
chemical<00:02:59.910> digestion<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.660> food<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.290> definitely

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
chemical digestion of food is definitely

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.490 
chemical digestion of food is definitely
due<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> salivary<00:03:02.549> glands<00:03:02.959> even<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.170> seeing

due to salivary glands even just seeing

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.250 
due to salivary glands even just seeing
food<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.430> television<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.480> seeing<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.900> picture

of food smelling food is going to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.199 
of food smelling food is going to
initiate<00:03:10.049> salivation<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.880> three

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
initiate salivation and you have three

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.870 
initiate salivation and you have three
pairs<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.900> salivary<00:03:13.680> glands<00:03:14.190> for<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.580> total<00:03:14.790> of

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
six the parotid glands are in this

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.039 
six the parotid glands are in this

are rooted and actually the majority of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.360 
are rooted and actually the majority of

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
parotid and sublingual so of course

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.440 
parotid and sublingual so of course
salivary<00:03:58.620> glands<00:03:58.920> release<00:03:59.280> saliva<00:03:59.579> so<00:04:00.209> what's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
salivary glands release saliva so what's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.050 
salivary glands release saliva so what's
in<00:04:00.600> saliva<00:04:00.930> well<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.920> vast<00:04:02.250> majority<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.910> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
in saliva well the vast majority of it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.300 
in saliva well the vast majority of it
is<00:04:03.150> water<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.109> what's<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.470> other<00:04:04.620> point<00:04:05.010> six

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
is water but what's the other point six

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.500 
is water but what's the other point six
