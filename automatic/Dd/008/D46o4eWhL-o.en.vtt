too long after that but cell mass two
point<00:00:46.170> oh<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.470> in<00:00:46.590> terms<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> what's<00:00:47.130> in<00:00:47.280> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
point oh look in terms of what's in this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
point oh look in terms of what's in this
product<00:00:47.760> BSN<00:00:48.630> have<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> gone<00:00:49.290> back<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
product BSN have really gone back to the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
product BSN have really gone back to the
drawing<00:00:50.070> board<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
drawing board with this which is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
drawing board with this which is
fantastic<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
fantastic I think because i think the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
fantastic I think because i think the
original<00:00:53.340> size<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.790> way<00:00:53.969> too<00:00:54.030> many

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
original size have way too many

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.260 
original size have way too many
proprietary<00:00:54.989> blends<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.550> couple

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
proprietary blends in there but couple

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
proprietary blends in there but couple
of<00:00:57.360> interesting<00:00:57.570> things<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> cell<00:00:58.500> mass<00:00:58.649> two

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
of interesting things in cell mass two

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.420 
of interesting things in cell mass two
point<00:00:59.100> oh<00:00:59.160> we've<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.399> creatine<00:00:59.969> monohydrate

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
point oh we've got creatine monohydrate

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.459 
point oh we've got creatine monohydrate
we've<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.789> creatine<00:01:03.180> hydrochloride<00:01:03.809> which

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
we've got creatine hydrochloride which

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.830 
we've got creatine hydrochloride which
is<00:01:04.619> concrete<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.399> one<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.030> favorite<00:01:06.600> types

of creatine that's fantastic they've
also<00:01:08.790> put<00:01:08.940> creatine<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.600> Hajus<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.350> as

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
also put creatine and Hajus in there as

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.780 
also put creatine and Hajus in there as
well<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.680> three<00:01:11.100> different<00:01:11.490> types<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
blend they've also got whey protein

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
blend they've also got whey protein
hydrolysate<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.299> hydrolyzed<00:01:18.869> whey<00:01:19.049> protein

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
hydrolysate or hydrolyzed whey protein

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
hydrolysate or hydrolyzed whey protein
they've<00:01:20.369> got<00:01:20.490> glutamine<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they've got glutamine in there and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.350 
they've got glutamine in there and
glutamine<00:01:21.810> peptides<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.560> recovery<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.360> and

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
good recovery muscle soreness is down as

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.409 
good recovery muscle soreness is down as
well<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:05.189> at<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.549> point<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.060> time<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.389> know

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
so much to point of the thumbs up I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.559 
so much to point of the thumbs up I
personally<00:03:10.530> wasn't<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.129> big<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> fan<00:03:11.639> of<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
personally wasn't that big a fan of the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.690 
personally wasn't that big a fan of the
original<00:03:12.659> cell<00:03:13.319> mass<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.189> kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.549> went

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
original cell mass so I kind of went

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.270 
original cell mass so I kind of went
into<00:03:14.909> some<00:03:15.209> us<00:03:15.389> two<00:03:15.599> point<00:03:15.870> O<00:03:15.989> with<00:03:16.680> very<00:03:17.069> low

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
into some us two point O with very low

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.449 
into some us two point O with very low
expectations<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:19.079> look<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.769> i<00:03:19.889> said<00:03:20.099> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
expectations but look like i said the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.159 
expectations but look like i said the
results<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.120> been<00:03:21.150> pretty<00:03:21.480> good<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.930> muscle

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
results have been pretty good so muscle

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.199 
results have been pretty good so muscle
recovery<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.889> up<00:03:23.069> muscle<00:03:23.459> soreness<00:03:23.669> is<00:03:23.970> down

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
recovery is up muscle soreness is down

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.119 
recovery is up muscle soreness is down
that's<00:03:24.959> pretty<00:03:25.169> much<00:03:25.379> where<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.829> ask<00:03:25.949> for
