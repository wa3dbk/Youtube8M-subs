00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:19.619
 Wagner pizza bicakcic is the new right 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.990
 Great to say just interested 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.550
 stop again 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.550
 and also for the not so ingredients 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 well, now are such pepperoni on it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:56.360
 should not be Mexican inspired 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.360
 The best pics intentions do not matter once 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 269 sharp 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:54.220
 I would say the beach taste 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:02:01.780
 is not over meat in it is that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:05.100
 tastes itself as typical 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 dictionary is better the taste 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:26.080
 constitutional presumption becomes first 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:29.670
 one by one yes it kinda ok ok now 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.670
 there is a warning on it is shaaf 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.430
 I would say sharp enough alone 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.650
 Not 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.540
 what do you say to it it still has to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 somehow nice taste have sharp 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.530
 alone is not enough 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 that is too boring it somehow goes 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.959
 so do not be such a one 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.989
 nice nice sweet taste or something 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.459
 however you call that what you call 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.170
 usually at a quality 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.760
 I would say the meat pay 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.049
 goes much too down when our whole 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.959
 the meat looks relatively exposed 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.410
 and what is actually like one 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.410
 meat dish 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:04:06.030
 Citizen is back with take that 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:09.000
 clash between drk in Wagner music okay 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.000
 is
