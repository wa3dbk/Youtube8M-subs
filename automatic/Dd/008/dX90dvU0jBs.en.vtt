body<00:01:58.810> doesn't<00:01:59.110> just<00:01:59.409> use<00:01:59.470> fat<00:01:59.950> from<00:02:00.250> one<00:02:00.460> spot

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
body doesn't just use fat from one spot

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.940 
body doesn't just use fat from one spot
of<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.000> body<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.690> reason<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.350> this<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
of the body the reason for this is that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.460 
of the body the reason for this is that
the<00:02:03.070> body<00:02:03.370> needs<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.940> properly<00:02:04.510> adapt<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.320> what

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the body needs to properly adapt to what

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.930 
the body needs to properly adapt to what
you're<00:02:05.650> doing<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.670> most<00:02:06.820> common

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
you're doing to it so the most common

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.570 
you're doing to it so the most common
way<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.479> go<00:02:07.780> about<00:02:07.900> spot<00:02:08.530> burn<00:02:08.769> reduction<00:02:09.429> is

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
way to go about spot burn reduction is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.550 
way to go about spot burn reduction is
by<00:02:09.729> training<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.300> abdominal<00:02:10.899> region<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.380> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
by training the abdominal region and the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.229 
by training the abdominal region and the
oblique<00:02:11.860> region<00:02:12.280> remember<00:02:12.790> what<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.090> went

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
oblique region remember what we went

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.360 
oblique region remember what we went
over<00:02:13.510> before<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:14.080> said<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> love<00:02:14.830> handles<00:02:15.280> or

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
over before we said that love handles or

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.060 
over before we said that love handles or
deposits<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.150> excess<00:02:16.660> fat<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.560> sides<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
deposits of excess fat on the sides of a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.110 
deposits of excess fat on the sides of a
person's<00:02:18.489> waistline<00:02:18.970> not<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.330> lack<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.810> muscle

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
person's waistline not a lack of muscle

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.880 
person's waistline not a lack of muscle
doing<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.269> method<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:22.989> actually<00:02:23.410> make

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
doing this method you can actually make

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.070 
doing this method you can actually make
your<00:02:24.220> love<00:02:24.670> handles<00:02:24.850> appear<00:02:25.299> much<00:02:25.600> larger

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
your love handles appear much larger

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.150 
your love handles appear much larger
than<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.350> really<00:02:26.650> are

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
than they really are

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
than they really are
so<00:02:27.459> picture<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:28.000> your<00:02:28.500> abdominal<00:02:29.500> region

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
so picture this your abdominal region

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.680 
so picture this your abdominal region
your<00:02:30.130> obliques<00:02:30.549> are<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.269> be<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:31.420> black

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
your obliques are going to be in black

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.750 
your obliques are going to be in black
your<00:02:32.260> love<00:02:32.500> handles<00:02:32.980> are<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> be<00:02:33.670> in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
your love handles are going to be in

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.910 
your love handles are going to be in
blue<00:02:34.030> when<00:02:34.540> you're<00:02:34.720> training<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.350> abdominal

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
blue when you're training your abdominal

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.710 
blue when you're training your abdominal
region<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.489> your<00:02:36.640> oblique<00:02:36.910> region<00:02:37.330> you're

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
region and your oblique region you're

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960 
region and your oblique region you're
increasing<00:02:38.049> your<00:02:38.320> muscle<00:02:38.799> mass<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.519> by<00:02:39.640> doing

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
increasing your muscle mass and by doing

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.860 
increasing your muscle mass and by doing
that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.339 
that
pushing<00:02:41.319> outwards<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.310> your<00:02:42.760> stomach<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> this

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
pushing outwards on your stomach so this

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.369 
pushing outwards on your stomach so this
region<00:02:44.650> between<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:46.269> skin<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.959> your<00:02:46.989> stomach

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
region between the skin of your stomach

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.670 
region between the skin of your stomach
and<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.489> muscle<00:02:49.030> right<00:02:49.629> in<00:02:49.840> here<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:50.620> is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
and the muscle right in here this is

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.250 
and the muscle right in here this is
your<00:02:50.860> excess<00:02:51.400> fat<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.299> what's<00:02:52.510> happening<00:02:53.049> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
your excess fat so what's happening is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.740 
your excess fat so what's happening is
that<00:02:53.830> your<00:02:54.040> abs<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.790> getting<00:02:55.120> bigger<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
that your abs are getting bigger and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.899 
that your abs are getting bigger and
they're<00:02:56.110> pushing<00:02:56.620> out<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:57.040> your<00:02:57.280> excess<00:02:57.640> fat

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
they're pushing out on your excess fat

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.710 
they're pushing out on your excess fat
so<00:02:58.569> then<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.709> makes<00:02:59.950> your<00:03:00.269> love<00:03:01.269> handles

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
so then it makes your love handles

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.869 
so then it makes your love handles
appear<00:03:01.989> much<00:03:02.349> larger<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:03.159> this<00:03:03.340> method<00:03:03.519> pretty

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
appear much larger so this method pretty

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.580 
appear much larger so this method pretty
much<00:03:04.000> backfires<00:03:04.569> because<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.260> does<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
much backfires because it does the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.259 
much backfires because it does the
opposite<00:03:06.159> of<00:03:06.250> what<00:03:06.430> you're<00:03:06.579> trying<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.909> do<00:03:07.060> now

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
opposite of what you're trying to do now

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.509 
opposite of what you're trying to do now
this<00:03:07.420> does<00:03:07.629> not<00:03:07.780> necessarily<00:03:08.079> mean<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:09.220> not

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
this does not necessarily mean to not

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.520 
this does not necessarily mean to not
train<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.060> abs<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.629> I'll<00:03:10.720> go<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:11.079> into<00:03:11.290> that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
train the abs and I'll go more into that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.229 
train the abs and I'll go more into that
when<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:11.920> talk<00:03:12.099> about<00:03:12.250> how<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.519> get<00:03:12.730> rid<00:03:12.879> now

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
when we talk about how to get rid now

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.490 
when we talk about how to get rid now
I'm<00:03:13.359> not<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.720> get<00:03:13.840> into<00:03:14.049> much<00:03:14.200> detail

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I'm not going to get into much detail

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.289 
I'm not going to get into much detail
about<00:03:14.920> genetics<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.640> will<00:03:15.879> say<00:03:16.090> this

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
about genetics but I will say this

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.599 
about genetics but I will say this
genetics<00:03:17.079> play<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.319> big<00:03:17.709> role<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.040> lifestyle

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
genetics play a big role in lifestyle

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.220 
genetics play a big role in lifestyle
and<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:18.970> makes<00:03:19.150> gaining<00:03:19.569> weight<00:03:19.690> or<00:03:19.989> losing

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
and it makes gaining weight or losing

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
and it makes gaining weight or losing
weight<00:03:20.379> more<00:03:20.799> difficult<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.519> certain<00:03:21.819> people

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
weight more difficult for certain people

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.509 
weight more difficult for certain people
however<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.140> being<00:03:23.319> said<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.190> not

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
however with that being said it is not

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.940 
however with that being said it is not
impossible<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.659> lose<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.140> love<00:03:26.349> him<00:03:26.560> you're

impossible to lose you love him you're
just<00:03:26.980> going<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.609> good<00:03:27.909> attitude<00:03:28.090> about

it and just keep pushing through and

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.550 
it and just keep pushing through and
finally<00:03:30.640> we<00:03:31.000> have<00:03:31.120> magic<00:03:31.690> fat<00:03:31.959> loss<00:03:32.230> pills

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
finally we have magic fat loss pills

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.720 
finally we have magic fat loss pills
they<00:03:33.069> don't<00:03:33.310> exist
