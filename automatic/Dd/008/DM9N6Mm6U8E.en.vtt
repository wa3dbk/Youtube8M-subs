what<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:14.820> noticed<00:05:15.390> was<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:15.960> they<00:05:16.410> seemed<00:05:16.680> to

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
what I noticed was that they seemed to

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.380 
what I noticed was that they seemed to
be<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:17.130> you'd<00:05:17.310> use<00:05:17.340> bigger<00:05:17.910> streets

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390
