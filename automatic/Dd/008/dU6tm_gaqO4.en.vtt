the<00:00:00.240> split<00:00:00.570> step<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.230> ready<00:00:01.469> position

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
the split step and the ready position

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.610 
the split step and the ready position
are<00:00:02.040> very<00:00:02.340> closely<00:00:02.700> related<00:00:02.939> and

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
are very closely related and

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.019 
are very closely related and
mechanically<00:00:04.620> speaking<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.339> split<00:00:05.640> step<00:00:05.879> is

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
mechanically speaking the split step is

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.320 
mechanically speaking the split step is
just<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.359> small<00:00:06.750> hop<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.259> take<00:00:07.970> behind<00:00:08.970> me<00:00:09.150> I'm

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
just a small hop you take behind me I'm

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.620 
just a small hop you take behind me I'm
in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.900> ready<00:00:10.260> position<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.059> split<00:00:12.059> step<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
in the ready position and a split step I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.560 
in the ready position and a split step I
take<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> small<00:00:14.009> hop<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.670> not<00:00:14.940> getting<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.420> ton

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
take a small hop I'm not getting a ton

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.760 
take a small hop I'm not getting a ton
of<00:00:15.630> air<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:15.990> only<00:00:16.170> getting<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.619> inch

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
of air I'm only getting about an inch

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.250 
of air I'm only getting about an inch
off<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> ground<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.670> then<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> land<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.840> weight

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
off the ground and then I land my weight

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
off the ground and then I land my weight
transfers<00:00:19.859> down<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:21.000> critically

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
transfers down that's critically

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970 
transfers down that's critically
important<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> split<00:00:22.380> step<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> weight

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
important when you split step the weight

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.450 
important when you split step the weight
comes<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.420> I've<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.650> both<00:00:26.099> feet

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
comes down and I've got it on both feet

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300 
comes down and I've got it on both feet
and<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.810> zoom<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:29.189> can

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and if we zoom in a little bit we can

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.620 
and if we zoom in a little bit we can
see<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.730> bit<00:00:29.849> more<00:00:29.910> clearly<00:00:30.330> what

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
see a little bit more clearly what

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
see a little bit more clearly what
that's<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> look<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.880> split<00:00:32.880> about

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
that's going to look like I split about

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
that's going to look like I split about
an<00:00:33.270> inch<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.600> air<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> land<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
an inch of air and then I land and the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.150 
an inch of air and then I land and the
weight<00:00:35.190> centers<00:00:35.579> down<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.090> both<00:00:36.719> feet<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
weight centers down on both feet and the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
weight centers down on both feet and the
split<00:00:38.520> step<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> allow<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.690> be

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
split step is going to allow you to be

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.229 
split step is going to allow you to be
more<00:00:40.230> explosive<00:00:40.739> than<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> otherwise<00:00:41.910> would

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
more explosive than you otherwise would

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
more explosive than you otherwise would
be<00:00:42.719> able<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> move<00:00:43.739> more

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
be able to you're going to move more

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
be able to you're going to move more
quickly<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.910> explosively<00:00:45.600> towards<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
quickly more explosively towards the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.860 
quickly more explosively towards the
tennis<00:00:46.379> ball<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.940> split<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tennis ball if you split and have the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
tennis ball if you split and have the
weight<00:00:49.050> come<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> were<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
weight come down than if you were just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
weight come down than if you were just
standing<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.899> ready<00:00:52.140> position<00:00:52.320> because

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
standing in the ready position because

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
standing in the ready position because
what<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> split<00:00:53.370> step<00:00:53.730> does<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.020> acts<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
what the split step does is it acts as a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160 
what the split step does is it acts as a
natural<00:00:55.949> spring<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> split<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
natural spring when you split and your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.400 
natural spring when you split and your
weight<00:00:58.379> comes<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:59.000> each<00:01:00.000> leg<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.840> coiled

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
weight comes down each leg is now coiled

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
weight comes down each leg is now coiled
up<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.190> push<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.090> more

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
up and you can push off it more

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080 
up and you can push off it more
explosively<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> otherwise<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.309> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
explosively than you otherwise would be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.929 
explosively than you otherwise would be
able<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.619> let's<00:01:07.619> talk<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> split

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
able to let's talk about when you split

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.960 
able to let's talk about when you split
and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.600> timing<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> your<00:01:10.290> split<00:01:10.909> now<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and the timing of your split now you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
and the timing of your split now you
want<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> split<00:01:12.630> step<00:01:12.840> every<00:01:13.350> single<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:14.010> your

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
want a split step every single time your

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
want a split step every single time your
opponent<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.760> about<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> make<00:01:15.420> contact<00:01:16.020> with

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
opponent is about to make contact with

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
opponent is about to make contact with
the<00:01:16.259> tennis<00:01:16.560> ball<00:01:16.770> since<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.790> know

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the tennis ball since you don't know

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
the tennis ball since you don't know
where<00:01:18.180> he's<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> hit<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.500> need<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
where he's going to hit it you need to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
where he's going to hit it you need to
be<00:01:19.860> able<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> move<00:01:20.490> explosively<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.540> any

be able to move explosively in any

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
be able to move explosively in any
direction<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> court<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.250> again<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
direction around the court and again the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.660 
direction around the court and again the
split<00:01:24.030> step<00:01:24.270> lets<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.549> do

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
split step lets you do that now when do

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
split step lets you do that now when do
you<00:01:26.729> time<00:01:27.060> your<00:01:27.299> split<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> want<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> be

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you time your split well you want to be

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.450 
you time your split well you want to be
at<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.119> most<00:01:30.479> explosive<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:32.130> your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
at your most explosive so you want your

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.030 
at your most explosive so you want your
weight<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.960> legs<00:01:34.229> coiled<00:01:34.860> like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
weight down and your legs coiled like

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.240 
weight down and your legs coiled like
Springs<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.509> instant<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.259> realize<00:01:37.740> where

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Springs at the instant you realize where

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
Springs at the instant you realize where
the<00:01:38.520> tennis<00:01:38.850> ball<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> you're

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the tennis ball is going and you're

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
the tennis ball is going and you're
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.650> figure<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.790> opponent

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
going to figure out where your opponent

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
going to figure out where your opponent
has<00:01:42.450> hit<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> ball<00:01:43.009> after<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> ball<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
has hit the ball after the ball is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
office string so when it's traveling

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
office string so when it's traveling
back<00:01:46.680> at<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:48.000> when<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.540> to

back at you that's when you're going to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.999 
back at you that's when you're going to
realize<00:01:49.020> okay<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.500> coming<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.799> fore

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
hands coming to my backhand it's going

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.999 
hands coming to my backhand it's going
to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.840> short<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> pull<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:52.979> back

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to be short it's going to pull me back

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.440 
to be short it's going to pull me back
and<00:01:55.130> practically<00:01:56.130> speaking<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.090> means

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and practically speaking what that means

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
and practically speaking what that means
is<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.860> opponent<00:01:59.460> starts<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> swing

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
is when your opponent starts to swing

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
is when your opponent starts to swing
forward<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> hit<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> ball<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
forward to hit the ball that's when you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
forward to hit the ball that's when you
split<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.560> air<00:02:04.770> at

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.350 
split so you want to be in the air at
the<00:02:05.880> instant<00:02:06.420> your<00:02:06.780> opponent<00:02:07.350> makes<00:02:07.740> contact

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the instant your opponent makes contact

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.930 
the instant your opponent makes contact

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
let's take a look at how we move and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.970 
let's take a look at how we move and
specifically<00:02:18.820> when<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.450> split<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.740> each<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
specifically when we split when each of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.210 
specifically when we split when each of
us<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.880> hit<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> ball<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:23.200> Andre<00:02:23.590> on

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
us is about to hit the ball so Andre on

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.940 
us is about to hit the ball so Andre on
my<00:02:24.520> left<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.690> about<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.770> make<00:02:26.890> contact

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
my left here is about to make contact

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.790 
my left here is about to make contact
and<00:02:27.820> as<00:02:28.150> he<00:02:28.450> swings<00:02:28.750> forward<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.380> see<00:02:29.590> now

and as he swings forward you can see now
I'm<00:02:30.130> starting<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.760> split<00:02:31.150> step<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.200> once<00:02:32.590> he

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
I'm starting to split step so once he

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.310 
I'm starting to split step so once he
makes<00:02:32.890> contact<00:02:33.160> I'm<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> air<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.290> I

makes contact I'm in the air and then I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.070 
makes contact I'm in the air and then I
land<00:02:35.830> as<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.340> ball<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.880> traveling<00:02:37.480> back<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.750> me

swing forward Andre is now about to hit
his<00:02:46.930> split<00:02:47.260> step<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.880> once<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.030> make<00:02:49.239> contact

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
his split step and once I make contact

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
his split step and once I make contact
the<00:02:49.989> ball<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.410> now<00:02:50.560> traveling<00:02:51.130> back<00:02:51.370> towards

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the ball is now traveling back towards

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.479 
the ball is now traveling back towards
Andre<00:02:52.120> he's<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> air<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.739> he<00:02:53.920> lands

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
Andre he's in the air and then he lands

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.810 
Andre he's in the air and then he lands
moves<00:02:55.239> out<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.600> his<00:02:55.810> ground<00:02:56.170> stroke<00:02:56.560> and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
moves out to his ground stroke and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.880 
moves out to his ground stroke and
finally<00:02:57.820> one<00:02:58.030> more<00:02:58.090> time<00:02:58.480> he<00:02:59.080> sets<00:02:59.380> up<00:02:59.590> begins

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
finally one more time he sets up begins

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.050 
finally one more time he sets up begins
to<00:03:00.220> swing<00:03:00.459> forward<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.150> now<00:03:01.750> again<00:03:01.930> I'm

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
to swing forward and now again I'm

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
to swing forward and now again I'm
hitting<00:03:04.060> my<00:03:04.360> split<00:03:04.690> step<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.230> as<00:03:05.470> he<00:03:05.830> makes

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
hitting my split step so as he makes

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.460 
hitting my split step so as he makes
contact<00:03:06.520> I'm<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> air<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.570> then<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.080> come

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
contact I'm in the air and then I come

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.410 
contact I'm in the air and then I come
down<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.980> now<00:03:09.190> I've<00:03:09.489> realized<00:03:09.880> where<00:03:10.270> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
down and now I've realized where the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.970 
down and now I've realized where the
tennis<00:03:10.750> ball<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.020> going<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.830> move

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
tennis ball is going so I can move

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.670 
tennis ball is going so I can move
explosively<00:03:12.790> towards<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> ball<00:03:14.020> very

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
explosively towards the ball very

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.550 
explosively towards the ball very
quickly<00:03:15.480> let's<00:03:16.480> look<00:03:16.660> at<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.840> split<00:03:17.080> steps<00:03:17.380> of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
quickly let's look at the split steps of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.400 
quickly let's look at the split steps of
a<00:03:17.620> couple<00:03:17.920> pros<00:03:18.190> behind<00:03:19.150> me<00:03:19.299> here<00:03:19.570> we've<00:03:20.140> got

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.820 
again probably at over 130 miles an hour
and<00:04:57.090> if<00:04:58.090> we<00:04:58.300> get<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.720> closer<00:04:59.110> look<00:04:59.440> at<00:04:59.620> what

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
and if we get a closer look at what

about to cross the net Sapan is in the
air<00:05:05.200> he's<00:05:05.860> probably<00:05:06.130> about<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.880> top<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.270> his

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.030 
air he's probably about the top of his
split<00:05:07.630> step<00:05:07.870> right<00:05:08.110> now<00:05:08.320> he's<00:05:08.560> going<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:08.980> be

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
split step right now he's going to be

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.520 
split step right now he's going to be
coming<00:05:09.340> back<00:05:09.370> down<00:05:09.760> but<00:05:10.570> again<00:05:10.930> what<00:05:11.290> I<00:05:11.320> want

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
coming back down but again what I want

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.320 
coming back down but again what I want
to<00:05:11.620> highlight<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.280> point<00:05:12.640> is<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:12.880> even

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.970 
you are still going to be in the air
after<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:22.390> ball<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:22.720> off<00:05:23.230> your<00:05:23.440> opponent's

strings<00:05:24.280> because<00:05:24.730> again<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.390> this<00:05:25.870> situation

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
strings because again in this situation

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.100 
strings because again in this situation
here<00:05:26.890> Safin<00:05:27.760> doesn't<00:05:28.300> yet<00:05:28.480> know<00:05:28.510> where<00:05:28.990> the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
here Safin doesn't yet know where the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.570 
here Safin doesn't yet know where the
ball<00:05:29.350> is<00:05:29.380> going<00:05:29.650> he<00:05:29.800> simply<00:05:30.100> just<00:05:30.220> doesn't

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
ball is going he simply just doesn't

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.890 
ball is going he simply just doesn't
have<00:05:30.669> enough<00:05:30.910> time<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.330> ball<00:05:31.480> is<00:05:31.510> being<00:05:31.780> hit

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
have enough time the ball is being hit

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.470 
have enough time the ball is being hit
so<00:05:31.930> hard<00:05:32.530> he<00:05:33.220> doesn't<00:05:33.640> know<00:05:33.730> where<00:05:33.940> it's<00:05:34.060> going

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
so hard he doesn't know where it's going

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480 
so hard he doesn't know where it's going
so<00:05:34.930> he's<00:05:35.110> going<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.470> be<00:05:35.590> in<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.950> air<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.370> when

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
so he's going to be in the air and when

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.180 
so he's going to be in the air and when
he<00:05:36.580> lands<00:05:37.210> at<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.990> moment<00:05:38.320> he<00:05:38.830> will<00:05:39.010> know

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
he lands at that moment he will know

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.860 
he lands at that moment he will know
where<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.490> ball<00:05:39.700> is<00:05:39.730> going<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.330> then<00:05:40.570> he<00:05:40.720> can

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
where the ball is going and then he can

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.830 
where the ball is going and then he can
move<00:05:41.080> as<00:05:41.460> explosive<00:05:42.460> as<00:05:42.640> possible<00:05:42.940> towards

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
move as explosive as possible towards

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.470 
move as explosive as possible towards
the<00:05:43.960> tennis<00:05:44.260> ball
