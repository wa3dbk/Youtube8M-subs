00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.930
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.720
 new assembled video 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.090
 the louvre in the heart of paris was once 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.600
 french royal palace and is 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.940
 nowadays thanks to his museum 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.920
 world famous in place 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.140
 for the first time in the twelfth century 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.440
 building in the following 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.869
 was always in flux for centuries 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.830
 The latest addition is the glass pyramid 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.379
 in the courtyard of the louvre since 1989 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.390
 Here is the main entrance of the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.610
 museums 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.640
 So now has lego the louvre a 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.250
 architecture set donated can be seen 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.650
 Part of the building is the main entrance 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.840
 and another little pyramid and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.410
 also the water surfaces around the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.410
 Pyramid are arranged in the set 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 reflected 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.090
 and here we see the beautiful 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.850
 transparent briggs for use 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.600
 come and there is this wonderful 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 glass pyramid behind it the second one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.090
 small pyramid and the water surfaces 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 and here you walk in, that's the one 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 main entrance of the louvre 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.620
 a flight over this new lego set 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 and a close-up of the little one 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.380
 pyramid 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.380
 small but nice 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.530
 the fas 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.990
 is very consistent the bows will be fine 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.100
 reproduced and also the colors 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.100
 I really like it 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.080
 and another look at the facade 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.080
 in all its glory 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:00.170
 and then we look up the roof 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.170
 put the crown on the whole 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.610
 reflected in the sunlight 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.369
 Everything is very nice and it becomes clear 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.760
 that the pyramid and the building as 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.459
 to harmonize this very well 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
 the construction of the louvre in the lego form 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.480
 is very diverse 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.319
 There are many different parts 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 for use 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.920
 the pyramid stands out with his 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290
 transparent elements 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.269
 but also the facade of the louvre needs 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.680
 whether the chic color design and 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.150
 not to hide many details 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 the lego architecture louvre a true 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.160
 gesamtkunstwerk 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.599
 so was the presentation of the sets lego 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.239
 architecture louvre 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.930
 until the next time france build and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.930
 bye
