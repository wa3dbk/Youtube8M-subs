00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello welcome one more day does bad hd 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 Today I bring you good as you are seeing 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 in the title of the end of the prestige to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.019
 end of this prestigious the pipe we go 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.179
 to see a bit the statistics I'm going to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.380
 talk a little some things not 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.450
 some stories 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.720
 well here the little medals we will see 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.720
 heartbreaker mercilessly enough 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 little bit because you know well no 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 end at least get a mega down 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 of these but good as with pipe 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 it's quite complicated they get a thousand 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 low with pistols gets 50 with a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.989
 hunter worth vale 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.550
 worth it good to teach first the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.270
 classes that I have the classes that is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.680
 using vale although you see here 23 you are 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.570
 Well, it's obviously obviously the one that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 I used the 23 the reyno the one that I have not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.940
 changed as you see I have no more classes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.149
 with a gun and well I'll be able to comment 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.699
 a little bit what what I what 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.890
 I recommend it, I recommend if you use 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.949
 the tag for me the best pistols are 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.320
 state 45 and is cap 40 by order 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.049
 first they are to the first 40 as 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.350
 better gun and then attack 45 by 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.689
 Much like it seems 20 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.409
 may be the best for me is not the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.880
 best 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.990
 it costs a lot to kill with it is pretty 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.729
 complicated and good to comment 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.479
 as you see here the class are 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.579
 practically the same all in tag 45 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.810
 I've been fast charged simply because 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.549
 good in a visit is a charger 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.430
 expanded you see here with light weight 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.770
 toughness agile hands and engineer centex and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.619
 two shocked engineer hours because 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.210
 good because I take help package and it's 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.890
 sing or go to see many gameplays 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 I have a four or five examples 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.330
 engravings of games with gun and is 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.830
 amazing what what you kill with the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.350
 packages it seems that no but they come out a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 lots of things when changing and although 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.799
 look like they give you a very good thing 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.209
 you change it even if it's a 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.770
 lightning or anything of that the 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.860
 change that can come out an escort drone 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.690
 swarms dogs all agile hands 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.429
 to launch the mower if they are the ones 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.319
 excited now if the people and hardness 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.280
 good so that not so that you do not get 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.259
 affect a lot that you are shooting 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.759
 light weight to move a bit more 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.740
 fast and leave circumstances a bit 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.299
 adverse and I said the classes are 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.039
 exactly the same these two only 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.350
 change that good for cap 40 yo 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.780
 I recommend extended charger that you see 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.209
 here the only difference is that no and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.500
 I have one for this class because 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.850
 he was playing a lot he's never at a 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.110
 level of many people with insertions 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.120
 tactics no 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.500
 So that's a good thing because 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 good people play to try to catch the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 I think it's good but good 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.160
 with this black hat for two and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.620
 engineer or removes and of stories here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.030
 teide de movida do not see again a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.960
 little statistics we go to barracks 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.390
 blabla bullet challenges that I'm not interested 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.740
 as you see here 2000 83 casualties we will see 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.650
 a summary of combat takes me a 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.959
 implacable the truth that I did not get a 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.150
 relentless with not many guns 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.770
 I really got charged I think at 15 with 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.870
 gun because I wasted the bullets 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.760
 but good 108 shots in the head a 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 mega relentless and beige there 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.739
 three most used pistols you do not see there 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.530
 you're practically 45 and cap 40 are the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.260
 lower the most used pistols with more 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.230
 low and then the b-23 rr not so 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.720
 well I recommend that you use cap 40 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.800
 although you see there that you are 45 it is like 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.170
 lowest value 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.640
 hunted 62 low and well let's see the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.560
 arms a little bit here we're going to see the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.530
 medals has taken me two in soria 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.510
 inexorable 9 relentless and 99 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.819
 bloodthirsty I think not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.709
 there were more reported there but good 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.470
 the action you do not see here a lot of 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.140
 things and good weapons as you see these 45 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.829
 chap 40 see here the difference 195 of 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.319
 deaths 178 deaths and here about 68 worth 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.569
 then you see here that are the most 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.730
 used then tie 25 which is what most 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.450
 I picked up the ground pw all these are 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.129
 low 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.739
 having caught nothing on the ground 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.209
 nothing great and good to hear and 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.250
 five seven new ones I used because 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.310
 I just do not like them absolutely 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.109
 nothing then good here all 000 000 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 let's compare a little the weapons of 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.760
 up here not the ones that I have told you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.959
 these two tac 45 to bullet and this is not 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.359
 can compare with each other is to compare 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.329
 with colleagues is good tactical failure 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.250
 hands entities and shocked the team to 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.120
 Sack to combat chat and black hat 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.160
 in short streak of points wow package 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.289
 help and hunter only that more used you see 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.030
 here that the endorsement more or less is the place 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.639
 from before he uses it more because he has it with 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.550
 some of these here but the best 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.409
 better to play even with any 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.229
 other weapons 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.300
 You can have the hunter for the wow 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.559
 response or by the guardian depending 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.089
 of the game mode that you play 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.559
 I recommend hunter because I do not know if 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:43.089
 they have gone up but it kills me on average 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 two or three per head and well as I say 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:46.689
 We will see the combat history 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.689
 here eight hours played two minutes and 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.639
 24 seconds low death rate 235 and 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.649
 good the defeats victories as good 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.239
 You already know that playing alone 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:56.679
 get into started games of the 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:57.999
 which I'm going back in again 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.489
 to enter and so on all the time 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:02.289
 in point point per minute 500 I almost do not think 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:03.669
 it's wrong so nothing but how good 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.949
 that you liked it I hope that I have 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.079
 molado and that they serve you the advice os 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.659
 I will bring enough things already about 

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:12.699
 the guns and about good I'll play with 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.919
 more games with the pistols for 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.689
 try to bring or gameplays and get 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.719
 those of diamond and good since we are 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.119
 here since we are in this site we are going 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.309
 to enter prestige by entering not 

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:26.769
 we enter prestige points of 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.269
 prestige in space for class and finally 

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:31.059
 I hope you liked that I have 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:32.199
 purple, it's good that you know that I'm going to 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.120
 keep trying to get the one from 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.620
 diamond to see how long it took 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.000
 that tomorrow we will return to normal 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.540
 as I said on twitter those who do not 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.540
 have registered 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.850
 regards
