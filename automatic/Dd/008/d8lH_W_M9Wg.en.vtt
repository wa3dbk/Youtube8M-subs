00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
cooking their prawns is be patient let

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.979 
cooking their prawns is be patient let
it<00:03:29.519> get<00:03:29.670> nice<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:29.850> brown<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.570> one<00:03:30.750> side

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
it get nice and brown on the one side

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.509 
it get nice and brown on the one side
just<00:03:31.380> add<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.310> parsley<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:33.150> here

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
just add a little bit of parsley in here

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.949 
just add a little bit of parsley in here
the<00:03:35.519> tiniest<00:03:36.360> bit<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.720> coarse<00:03:37.140> salt<00:03:38.959> they're

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the tiniest bit of coarse salt they're

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.290 
the tiniest bit of coarse salt they're
probably<00:03:40.200> still<00:03:40.790> pretty<00:03:41.790> salty

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
probably still pretty salty

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.640 
probably still pretty salty
but<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.330> think<00:03:44.660> these<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:45.080> enough<00:03:45.350> flavor

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
but I think these have enough flavor

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.160 
but I think these have enough flavor
they're<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.550> incredibly<00:03:47.060> fresh<00:03:47.390> let's<00:03:47.960> check

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
they're so incredibly fresh let's check

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.530 
they're so incredibly fresh let's check
out<00:03:48.320> our<00:03:48.440> other<00:03:48.560> pan<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.060> either

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
out our other pan here and either

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.870 
out our other pan here and either
looking<00:03:50.960> delicious<00:03:51.460> it<00:03:52.460> looks<00:03:52.520> like<00:03:52.760> our

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
looking delicious it looks like our

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.940 
looking delicious it looks like our
marinades<00:03:53.330> coming<00:03:53.690> off<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.050> we<00:03:54.170> made<00:03:54.380> extra

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
marinades coming off but we made extra

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.320 
marinades coming off but we made extra
to<00:03:55.160> drizzle<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.640> on<00:03:55.760> afterwards<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.060> think

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
to drizzle it on afterwards and I think

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.700 
to drizzle it on afterwards and I think
they're<00:03:59.480> getting<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.870> boat<00:04:00.020> ready<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.440> flip

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
they're getting a boat ready to flip

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.000 
they're getting a boat ready to flip
it's<00:04:00.920> only<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.190> couple<00:04:01.460> minutes<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.940> each<00:04:02.120> side

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
it's only a couple minutes on each side

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.630 
it's only a couple minutes on each side
so<00:04:04.010> we'll<00:04:04.130> flip<00:04:04.310> our<00:04:04.580> ponds<00:04:04.850> over<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:10.340> I'm
