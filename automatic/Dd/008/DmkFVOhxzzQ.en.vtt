00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
in the ring so that I think in boxing

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.740 
in the ring so that I think in boxing
all<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.010> need<00:04:05.189> is<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> puncher's<00:04:05.700> chance<00:04:05.750> I

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
all you need is a puncher's chance I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.959 
all you need is a puncher's chance I
don't<00:04:07.139> know<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.469> Robert<00:04:07.859> has<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.459> knockout

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
don't know if Robert has the knockout

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.179 
don't know if Robert has the knockout
power<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.870> speak<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.290> knock<00:04:10.439> out<00:04:10.590> what<00:04:11.159> I

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
power so to speak to knock out what I

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.649 
power so to speak to knock out what I
think<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.549> going<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.730> be<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.849> much<00:04:12.060> bigger<00:04:12.329> floyd

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
think is going to be a much bigger floyd

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.690 
think is going to be a much bigger floyd
mayweather<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.290> ring<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:14.159> it's<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.639> to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
mayweather in the ring but it's going to

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.550 
mayweather in the ring but it's going to
make<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:15.000> intriguing<00:04:15.480> as<00:04:15.720> hell<00:04:15.870> i<00:04:15.900> think<00:04:16.289> yeah

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
make it intriguing as hell i think yeah

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.949 
make it intriguing as hell i think yeah
I<00:04:16.590> think<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.220> edit<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.759> other<00:04:17.910> half<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
I think so to edit the other half of the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.900 
I think so to edit the other half of the
bay<00:04:19.109> fourth<00:04:19.410> matchup<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.009> it's<00:04:20.160> not<00:04:20.310> yet<00:04:20.639> a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
bay fourth matchup and it's not yet a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.689 
bay fourth matchup and it's not yet a
done<00:04:21.509> deal<00:04:21.750> but<00:04:22.019> cunado<00:04:22.349> Alvarez<00:04:22.889> is<00:04:23.130> one<00:04:23.610> of

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
done deal but cunado Alvarez is one of

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.659 
done deal but cunado Alvarez is one of
the<00:04:23.759> hot<00:04:23.910> properties<00:04:24.449> in<00:04:24.599> boxing<00:04:25.669> supposedly

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
the hot properties in boxing supposedly

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.719 
the hot properties in boxing supposedly
it<00:04:26.940> will<00:04:27.150> fight<00:04:27.479> Austin<00:04:28.229> trout<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:29.430> what<00:04:29.699> I

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
it will fight Austin trout and I what I

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.129 
it will fight Austin trout and I what I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
think Austin trout would I think it

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.700 
think Austin trout would I think it
would<00:04:57.210> beat<00:04:57.389> Canelo<00:04:57.780> Alvarez<00:04:58.080> in<00:04:58.320> my<00:04:58.440> opinion

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
if they went toe-to-toe I think it's a

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.300 
if they went toe-to-toe I think it's a
bad<00:05:00.389> matchup<00:05:00.659> for<00:05:01.020> Canelo<00:05:01.289> Styles<00:05:01.770> wise<00:05:01.949> and
