00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.170
 another video on a channel 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.849
 I also get the last word and you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.460
 see short excerpt from one 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.309
 rule ten play also the 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.710
 prize winner 294 uniqa 40 is also with 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 a start without condom the blackbird 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810
 i wanted the nuclear title here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 to die with a died at 27 0 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little stupid I knew that the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.490
 second has glitch and it was still ten 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 seconds to play then yes if I do so 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.769
 stupid of course blackbird had up 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 but regardless of the effect of the fun aside 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.020
 namely for the topic I have me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.860
 considering to make a team 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 in mw3 with the people of xxl e-sports 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.329
 therefore always play with the dsl 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.270
 we are now also focusing on cup 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 played together also won 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.420
 announced on facebook is stupid 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 if you live stream to the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 games were mostly equal streams 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.920
 but in the final is then after the second 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.449
 map of livestream failed because 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.770
 somehow second computer does not go anymore 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.940
 or what I was on everyone 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 Case mediated 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.810
 Although we won the cup, we did 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 no prize money but it was only mine 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 cap the next david prize money 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 but include the course times 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.770
 Although the next comments have become a team 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 make a bag already have a few clips 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.460
 So most players of xl have 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.680
 plays a few clips in the cell and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 we are looking for an editor 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.689
 I have that over the song now 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.130
 agreed that we have something on the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.600
 want to put legs but okay 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.210
 for the animals 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.229
 so it's mostly like that but ask 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.329
 not so it is not our case and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.159

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.710
