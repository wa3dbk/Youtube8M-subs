00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.450
 hello today we are going to make a salad 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.520
 Japanese calls 1 monkey to do it 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.099
 we will need two ingredients 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.650
 fundamentals are the cucumber and the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.650
 seaweed wakame apart from those ingredients 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.830
 we will also use vinegar soy sauce 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.210
 of rice salt sugar and finally to 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.280
 decorate some sesame seeds 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.559
 this is what is known as algae 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.750
 wakame is a very popular type of seaweed in 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.149
 you can find Japanese cuisine 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.399
 in the supermarket in this format as 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.260
 Dehydrated algae but you can also 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.540
 find in cans in which yes that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.159
 comes hydrated and in natural format with 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.250
 certain preservatives to not check 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.250
 to lose 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.900
 of a vegetable peeler let's go 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 by removing the plasters and cucumber 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 Band-aid not of the skin 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.370
 with the help of the mandolin we are going to cut 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.370
 the cucumber in thin slices 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.990
 We will measure the following quantities 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.979
 4 teaspoons of sugar 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 5 tablespoons of rice vinegar 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.689
 4 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.109
 and a spoonful of soy sauce 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.500
 and now what we're going to do is stir 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.500
 well until everything is well integrated 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.860
