00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.500
 Hi, I'm anna of breast recipes and today 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.429
 let's prepare a traditional sweet 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.429
 christmas the polvorones 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.580
 to make the polvorones I'm going to use 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.360
 a kilo of flour half a kilo of butter 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.250
 of pork half a kilo of sugar glas 250 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.919
 grams of almond 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.660
 a teaspoon of cinnamon and a little more 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.660
 of sugar for the final finish 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.859
 you start by touching a little flour 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.309
 put the kilo of flour in a tray 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.309
 of oven 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.780
 it extends well 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.930
 and baked for a half hour at 150 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 degrees in this way the flour loses the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.790
 humidity 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.300
 and it's at its point to use it in 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.300
 the polvorones 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.540
 the almonds are roasted too 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.540
 slightly in the oven 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.470
 Can be done 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.680
 at the same time as flour 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.500
 It is advisable to use an increase of 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.950
 quality I like the variety 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.950
 marcona 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.140
 after about 20 minutes it is taken out of the oven 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 moves and gets back to the 10 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.940
 remaining minutes 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 when the flour is removed from the oven there is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.830
 let it cool 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.759
 and sieves are passed through a sieve to 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.759
 have them loose 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.900
 with the help of a chopper they are crushed 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.900
 lightly toasted almonds 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.460
 the icing sugar is sifted past 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.460
 a strainer so that it is loose 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.240
 in a bowl you put the butter and the sugar 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.240
 glas that already made sifted 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.680
 You can beat by hand but it 's much more 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.290
 comfortable doing it with the help of a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 mixer of an electric mixer 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.470
 in principle a low speed is set 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.330
 when sugar and butter are good 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 integrated 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.220
 is added are lowered from the wall 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.430
 and while continuing to beat, little is added to 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.810
 little bit 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.810
 the grated almond 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 and a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.770
 to integrate well the flour I'm going to 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.800
 replace 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.350
 the kneading shovel by the hook 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.950
 baker 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.650
 if we do not have a mixer at home 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.270
 This type can knead by hand as 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.070
 has done all my life at my house 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.070
 mother starting the hand 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.010
 whenever it is integrating flour it is 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.180
 good to use a low speed for 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.440
 which can 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.750
 integrate well in the dough 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.910
 the dough is passed to a glass bowl 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.180
 and you finish moving a bit with the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.180
 hand 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.010
 to make polvorones and give it shape 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:18.419
 let's use some strips of 1 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.720
 phil kitchen height centimeter and a 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.720
 cutter 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 the dough is spread between the 2 phil's 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.880
 kitchen 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.890
 and with the help of the guide and the roller 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.890
 a plate of uniform dough is spread 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.270
 all right 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.000
 and now it's cut with a cutter 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.900
 I like to do it with a cutter 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.900
 tiny 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.169
 can also be cut with a cup or 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.599
 with a drink 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.499
 you do not have to have a cutter 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.499
 specific 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.200
 they rise with care because this mass 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.200
 It is very fragile 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.150
 it is given a little bit of shape 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.150
 or ballad pushing 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.270
 well with your fingers and put on a 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.270
 oven tray 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.760
 this dough does not grow much in the oven 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.020
 so that 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.020
 they can be together 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.409
 when the tray has been completed 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.650
 The oven is taken to the refrigerator and 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.830
 Refrigerate for at least one half 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.830
 hour 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.370
 Bake for about 15-20 minutes at 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.370
 200 degrees 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.670
 when they are taken out of the oven they are left 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.670
 cool in a grate 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.050
 would be formed with icing sugar and now 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.050
 wrapped in tissue paper 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.900
 this is polvorones 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.840
 the recipe for these polvorones 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.139
 is taken from a family recipe book 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.930
 old 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.849
 and it appears with the name of polvorones 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.919
 of the holy spirit 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:46.119
 the name of my school in Las Ramblas 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.119
 a people of color
