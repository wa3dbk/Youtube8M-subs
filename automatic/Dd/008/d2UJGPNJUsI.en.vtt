Lilith sahajiya I approached the

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.239 
Lilith sahajiya I approached the
painting<00:00:27.640> as<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:27.880> cityscape<00:00:28.419> at<00:00:28.869> night<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.439> used

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
painting as a cityscape at night I used

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.130 
painting as a cityscape at night I used
to<00:00:30.369> live<00:00:30.550> in<00:00:30.699> Long<00:00:30.909> Street<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:31.900> was

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
to live in Long Street and I was

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.780 
to live in Long Street and I was
inspired<00:00:32.800> by<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.399> city<00:00:34.300> life<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:36.610> we're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
inspired by the city life when we're

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.840 
inspired by the city life when we're
asked<00:00:37.150> to<00:00:37.180> replicate<00:00:38.100> someone's<00:00:39.100> art<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.700> it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
asked to replicate someone's art and it

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.300 
asked to replicate someone's art and it
happens<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.360> be<00:00:40.450> abstract<00:00:41.110> painting<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.740> find

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
happens to be abstract painting I find

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.000 
happens to be abstract painting I find
it<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.460> lot<00:00:42.580> more<00:00:42.730> difficult<00:00:42.790> than

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it a lot more difficult than

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.350 
it a lot more difficult than
representational<00:00:45.010> art<00:00:45.160> because<00:00:46.150> there's<00:00:46.300> a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
representational art because there's a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.760 
representational art because there's a
lot<00:00:46.510> more<00:00:46.690> emotion<00:00:47.110> involved<00:00:47.380> with<00:00:47.620> their

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
lot more emotion involved with their

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.540 
lot more emotion involved with their
painting<00:00:48.130> and<00:00:48.370> their<00:00:48.760> choices<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.480> color<00:00:49.690> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120 

try<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.610> break<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.570> up<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:56.020> didn't<00:00:56.590> want<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.890> show

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
try to break it up I didn't want to show

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.130 
try to break it up I didn't want to show
much<00:00:57.670> figures<00:00:58.120> there<00:00:58.510> could<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.840> car

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
much figures there could be a car

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.250 
much figures there could be a car
passing<00:00:59.830> by<00:00:59.980> in<00:01:00.280> buildings<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.270> some<00:01:01.480> people

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
passing by in buildings and some people

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.350 
passing by in buildings and some people
with<00:01:02.500> traffic<00:01:03.010> lights<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:03.910> it's<00:01:04.150> all<00:01:04.329> about

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
with traffic lights so it's all about

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.460 
with traffic lights so it's all about
the<00:01:04.869> cityscape

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.400 

abstract<00:01:09.370> I<00:01:09.810> sort<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> breaks<00:01:11.050> all<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.290> rules

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
abstract I sort of breaks all the rules

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.900 
abstract I sort of breaks all the rules
which<00:01:11.740> is<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.010> best<00:01:12.250> part<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.610> it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
which is the best part of it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.540 
which is the best part of it
I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.960> having<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.440> painting<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.070> public

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
I think having a painting on a public

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.240 
I think having a painting on a public
space<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:16.180> really<00:01:16.750> think<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:17.590> something<00:01:17.800> good

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
space I really think it's something good

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.610 
space I really think it's something good
because<00:01:18.820> most<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.780> paintings<00:01:20.200> are<00:01:20.380> bought

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
because most of the paintings are bought

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.420 
because most of the paintings are bought
by<00:01:20.650> copyrights<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.600> inside<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.620> the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
by copyrights and the inside and the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.430 
by copyrights and the inside and the
people<00:01:25.060> there<00:01:25.450> there<00:01:25.810> are<00:01:25.900> only<00:01:26.080> few<00:01:26.380> people

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
people there there are only few people

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.590 
people there there are only few people
work<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.430> cooperatives<00:01:28.120> we<00:01:28.240> will<00:01:28.390> see

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
work in that cooperatives we will see

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200 
work in that cooperatives we will see
but<00:01:29.470> when<00:01:29.830> something<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.460> outside<00:01:30.850> then

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
but when something is outside then

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.530 
but when something is outside then
that's<00:01:31.990> where<00:01:32.230> you<00:01:32.260> feel<00:01:32.590> better<00:01:32.890> because<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
that's where you feel better because the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.770 
that's where you feel better because the
message<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.230> are<00:01:35.440> about<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.100> send<00:01:37.000> there<00:01:37.540> to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
message we are about to send there to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.710 
message we are about to send there to
the<00:01:37.870> people<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.830> has<00:01:39.040> got<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.400> meaning<00:01:39.730> so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the people it has got the meaning so

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.520 
the people it has got the meaning so
working<00:01:41.350> on<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> public<00:01:41.950> space<00:01:42.160> I<00:01:43.119> really<00:01:44.050> think

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
working on a public space I really think

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
working on a public space I really think
it's<00:01:44.680> something<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.270> works<00:01:46.270> for<00:01:46.450> me

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.660 

this<00:01:49.869> texture<00:01:50.290> has<00:01:50.410> been<00:01:50.560> something<00:01:50.830> else<00:01:51.130> in

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
this texture has been something else in

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.109 
this texture has been something else in
itself<00:01:52.150> -<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:54.369> like<00:01:54.520> painting<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:55.050> alligator

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
itself - it's like painting a alligator

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.390 
itself - it's like painting a alligator
the<00:01:58.119> reaction<00:01:58.630> from<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.710> few<00:02:00.400> us<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.960> think

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
the reaction from the few us I think

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.240 
the reaction from the few us I think
also<00:02:03.400> inspires<00:02:04.090> me
