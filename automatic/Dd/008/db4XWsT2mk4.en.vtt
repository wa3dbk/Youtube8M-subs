remember my video of this but so how
this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.030> gonna<00:00:54.149> happen<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.780> you're<00:00:54.989> gonna<00:00:55.050> dig

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
this is gonna happen is you're gonna dig

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.430 
this is gonna happen is you're gonna dig
two<00:00:55.890> holes<00:00:56.420> wherever<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> gate<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
two holes wherever you want the gate to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.180 
two holes wherever you want the gate to
be<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> dig<00:00:59.699> down<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> Z<00:01:00.649> like<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
be you want to dig down to Z like so and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.840 
be you want to dig down to Z like so and
then<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.850> dig<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.199> front<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
then just dig out in front of it or the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.440 
then just dig out in front of it or the
pathway<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.189> that's<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
pathway to it and that's it now all you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.730 
pathway to it and that's it now all you
want<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.020> they'll<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
want to do now is they'll put your

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.960 
want to do now is they'll put your
sticky<00:01:11.159> pistons<00:01:11.670> facing<00:01:12.770> upward<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.790> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
sticky pistons facing upward so you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
sticky pistons facing upward so you can
retract<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:17.189> okay<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> how

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
retract up and down now okay this is how

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
retract up and down now okay this is how
it's<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.659> work<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.500> one

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it's gonna work you're gonna put one

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.980 
it's gonna work you're gonna put one
redstone<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.460> there

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
redstone right there

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.359 
redstone right there
you<00:01:21.990> wanna<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.680> gonna<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> clear<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you wanna you're gonna want to clear a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.130 
you wanna you're gonna want to clear a
path<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> reach<00:01:26.100> over<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.790> here

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
path for it so it can reach over to here

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
path for it so it can reach over to here
now<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> where<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> repeaters<00:01:30.000> comes<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
now this is where the repeaters comes in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.679 
now this is where the repeaters comes in
you<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> make<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.500> facing<00:01:31.979> towards<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
you want to make them facing towards the

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.910 
you want to make them facing towards the
Pistons<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:35.070> looking<00:01:35.250> straight<00:01:36.000> upwards

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
Pistons by just looking straight upwards

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280 
Pistons by just looking straight upwards
and<00:01:37.160> there<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:37.580> go<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.270> that's<00:01:38.480> it<00:01:38.660> now<00:01:38.840> last

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
and there we go now that's it now last

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.740 
and there we go now that's it now last
thing<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.620> do<00:01:39.830> just<00:01:40.160> for<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.540> just<00:01:41.540> for<00:01:41.690> the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
thing to do just for a just for the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490 
thing to do just for a just for the
switch<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.380> there<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.010> go<00:01:43.160> now<00:01:44.500> finishing

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
switch and there you go now finishing

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.520 
switch and there you go now finishing
touches<00:01:45.710> y'all<00:01:46.400> put<00:01:46.610> your<00:01:46.760> gates<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.690> you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
touches y'all put your gates on and you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.520 
touches y'all put your gates on and you
can<00:01:48.680> fill<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.980> there<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.730> go

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
can fill this up and there you go

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.900 
can fill this up and there you go
now<00:01:54.530> if<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:54.979> want<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.220> use<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:55.580> both<00:01:55.850> sides

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
now if you want to use it on both sides

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.420 
now if you want to use it on both sides
that's<00:01:56.540> another<00:01:57.229> easy<00:01:57.470> thing<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:58.190> do

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
that's another easy thing just do

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.480 
that's another easy thing just do
exactly<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.450> same<00:01:59.690> thing<00:02:00.280> nothing<00:02:01.280> hard

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
exactly the same thing nothing hard

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.870 
exactly the same thing nothing hard
about<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.990> very<00:02:02.990> simple

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.740 

put<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:07.299> here<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.860> there<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.069> go

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
put this here there and there you go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.000 
put this here there and there you go
that's<00:02:10.750> how<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:10.959> make<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.260> attractive<00:02:11.830> one

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
