a<00:01:04.079> couple<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> problems<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> old<00:01:05.129> system

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
a couple of problems with the old system

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.249 
a couple of problems with the old system
is<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.149> completed<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.630> citations<00:01:07.110> with

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
is one we completed the citations with

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.620 
is one we completed the citations with
ink<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> citation<00:01:08.310> got<00:01:08.640> wet<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.390> ink

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
ink so if the citation got wet the ink

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
ink so if the citation got wet the ink
would<00:01:09.810> run<00:01:10.079> with<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.469> new<00:01:10.619> system<00:01:11.009> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
would run with the new system the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
would run with the new system the
citations<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.210> water<00:01:12.509> resistant<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
citations are water resistant so a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
citations are water resistant so a
little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> rain<00:01:14.130> won't<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
little bit of rain won't make the

writing run the other problem we had
with<00:01:16.710> handwritten<00:01:17.640> citations<00:01:18.329> is

with handwritten citations is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
with handwritten citations is
handwriting<00:01:19.200> people<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> hard
