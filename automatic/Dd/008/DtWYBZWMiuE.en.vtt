good<00:00:00.420> morning<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:00.960> Duane<00:00:01.170> today<00:00:01.800> I'd

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
good morning this is Duane today I'd

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.800 
good morning this is Duane today I'd
like<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.429> about<00:00:02.540> pentatonic<00:00:03.540> a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
like to talk about pentatonic a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.950 
like to talk about pentatonic a
pentatonic<00:00:04.710> scale

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
pentatonic scale

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
pentatonic scale
now<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.290> diatonic<00:00:08.099> scale<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.269> you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
now a diatonic scale is the one you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.959 
now a diatonic scale is the one you
learned<00:00:10.230> when<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.559> took<00:00:11.160> piano<00:00:11.370> lessons<00:00:11.519> or

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
learned when you took piano lessons or

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.620 
learned when you took piano lessons or
that<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> didn't<00:00:13.110> take<00:00:13.170> piano<00:00:13.349> lessons

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
that if you didn't take piano lessons

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.240 
that if you didn't take piano lessons
you've<00:00:15.630> heard<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.740> scale<00:00:17.039> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you've heard it it's it's a scale that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.310 
you've heard it it's it's a scale that
sounds<00:00:17.609> small<00:00:17.820> lots<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.270> diatonic<00:00:19.020> major

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
sounds small lots of diatonic major

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
sounds small lots of diatonic major
scales<00:00:19.770> made<00:00:20.039> up<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> seven<00:00:20.760> different<00:00:20.850> notes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
scales made up of seven different notes

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.400 
scales made up of seven different notes
1<00:00:21.510> 2<00:00:21.779> 3<00:00:21.990> 4<00:00:22.320> 5<00:00:22.529> 6<00:00:22.859> 7<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.930> note<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then that note is a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.349 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then that note is a
repeat<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> note<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> octave

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
repeat of that note right the octave

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.529 
repeat of that note right the octave
note<00:00:27.449> ok<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.949> major<00:00:29.250> diatonic<00:00:30.210> scale

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
note ok so that's a major diatonic scale

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.770 
note ok so that's a major diatonic scale
a<00:00:30.900> minor<00:00:31.830> diatonic<00:00:32.700> scale<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.510> like

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
a minor diatonic scale would be like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
a minor diatonic scale would be like
this<00:00:34.550> flat<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.760> 3rd<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> depending

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this flat the 3rd and then on depending

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
this flat the 3rd and then on depending
on<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:38.579> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> minor<00:00:39.090> scale<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
on what kind of minor scale it is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.799 
on what kind of minor scale it is
there's<00:00:40.559> three<00:00:41.129> kinds<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> minor<00:00:41.790> scales<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
there's three kinds of minor scales it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.040 
there's three kinds of minor scales it
might<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.730> any<00:00:44.940> case<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:46.020> not

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
might go like that in any case we're not

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.569 
might go like that in any case we're not
talking<00:00:46.440> about<00:00:46.469> minor<00:00:46.800> scale<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.370> there's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
talking about minor scale so there's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
talking about minor scale so there's
three<00:00:47.969> kinds<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> minor<00:00:48.629> scales<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
three kinds of minor scales there's a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
three kinds of minor scales there's a
natural<00:00:49.530> minor<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.989> harmonic<00:00:51.989> minor

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
natural minor there's a harmonic minor

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
natural minor there's a harmonic minor
and<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> melodic<00:00:53.100> minor<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.850> won't<00:00:54.030> get

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and a melodic minor and we won't get

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.950 
and a melodic minor and we won't get
into<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.719> now

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
into that right now

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
into that right now
but<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.980> suffice<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> say<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.059> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
but just suffice it to say there are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
but just suffice it to say there are
major<00:00:57.300> scales<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.050> minor<00:00:58.289> scales<00:00:58.710> all

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
major scales there are minor scales all

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
major scales there are minor scales all
made<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> seven<00:01:00.149> notes<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:01.289> there's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
made out of seven notes and then there's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.910 
made out of seven notes and then there's
chromatic<00:01:02.129> scales<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:03.270> play<00:01:03.600> every<00:01:04.470> single

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
chromatic scales which play every single

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
chromatic scales which play every single
note<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.400> course<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.970> has<00:01:06.830> 12<00:01:07.830> 1<00:01:08.220> 2<00:01:08.460> 3<00:01:08.760> 4<00:01:09.090> 5

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
note and of course that has 12 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.160 
note and of course that has 12 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:09.630> 7<00:01:09.810> 8<00:01:10.080> 9<00:01:10.290> 10<00:01:10.560> 11<00:01:10.619> 12<00:01:11.010> 12<00:01:11.909> keys<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:13.049> all

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 keys to all

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 keys to all
different<00:01:13.320> keys<00:01:13.650> plus<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.310> octave<00:01:15.270> note

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
different keys plus the octave note

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530 
different keys plus the octave note
right<00:01:15.840> ok<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.759> there's<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> whole<00:01:18.240> tone

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
right ok and then there's a whole tone

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
right ok and then there's a whole tone
scale<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.290> skips<00:01:20.009> every<00:01:20.340> half<00:01:20.759> tone<00:01:21.000> scale

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
scale which skips every half tone scale

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
scale which skips every half tone scale
or<00:01:21.900> chromatic<00:01:22.470> scale<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> every<00:01:23.340> half-step

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
or chromatic scale is every half-step

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.620 
or chromatic scale is every half-step
right<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.320> whole<00:01:25.320> tone<00:01:25.560> scale<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.360> just<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
right a whole tone scale is just what it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.670 
right a whole tone scale is just what it
says<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.990> skip<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.280> always<00:01:29.490> skip<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> note<00:01:29.939> so

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
says you skip you always skip a note so

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.819 
says you skip you always skip a note so
second

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
second

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.429 
second
then<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.280> skip<00:01:33.579> a<00:01:33.640> key<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.780> wouldn't<00:01:35.229> play

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
then you skip a key so you wouldn't play

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.639 
then you skip a key so you wouldn't play
that<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.890> play<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.369> whole<00:01:37.180> step<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.750> up

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
that you play that whole step in up

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.620 
that you play that whole step in up
above<00:01:38.829> that<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.220> there<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.270> whole<00:01:40.420> step

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
above that is there and a whole step

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.109 
above that is there and a whole step
above<00:01:40.780> there<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.799> there<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.399> then<00:01:43.060> a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
above there that is there and then a

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.149 
above there that is there and then a
whole<00:01:43.270> step<00:01:43.450> above<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:44.049> there<00:01:44.289> so<00:01:46.289> 1<00:01:47.289> 2<00:01:47.649> 3

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
whole step above that is there so 1 2 3

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.440 
whole step above that is there so 1 2 3
4<00:01:48.909> 5<00:01:49.299> 6<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.130> 6<00:01:51.399> note<00:01:51.580> scale<00:01:51.850> plus<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
4 5 6 that's a 6 note scale plus the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.630 
4 5 6 that's a 6 note scale plus the
octave<00:01:52.840> note<00:01:52.869> isn't<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> ok<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.039> those<00:01:54.460> are

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
octave note isn't it ok so those are

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.340 
octave note isn't it ok so those are
some<00:01:54.789> of<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:54.939> various<00:01:55.329> kinds<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.840> scales<00:01:56.079> that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
some of the various kinds of scales that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.889 
some of the various kinds of scales that
you<00:01:56.409> encounter<00:01:56.920> our<00:01:57.039> music<00:01:57.369> now<00:01:58.360> today<00:01:58.750> we

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
you encounter our music now today we

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.419 
you encounter our music now today we
want<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.079> talk<00:01:59.170> about<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.500> pentatonic<00:01:59.979> scale

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
want to talk about the pentatonic scale

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.219 
want to talk about the pentatonic scale
in<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.909> sense<00:02:01.149> it's<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.450> easiest<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:02.079> all

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
in a sense it's the easiest of all

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.490 
in a sense it's the easiest of all
scales<00:02:02.649> because<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.579> just<00:02:03.700> has<00:02:03.909> 5<00:02:04.240> notes<00:02:04.569> it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
scales because it just has 5 notes it's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.440 
scales because it just has 5 notes it's
equivalent<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.159> if<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.000> played<00:02:07.209> all<00:02:07.360> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
equivalent to if you played all the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.970 
equivalent to if you played all the
Black<00:02:07.630> Keys<00:02:08.280> 3<00:02:09.280> 4<00:02:09.670> 5<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.350> pentatonic

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
Black Keys 3 4 5 that's a pentatonic

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.979 
Black Keys 3 4 5 that's a pentatonic
scale<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.489> if<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.420> made<00:02:13.780> your

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
scale and if you just made your

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:23.970 
scale and if you just made your
composition<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> Black<00:02:15.190> Keys

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.680 

if<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.220> sounds<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> little<00:02:25.700> oriental<00:02:26.390> that's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
if it sounds a little oriental that's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.840 
if it sounds a little oriental that's
why<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.320> does<00:02:27.650> because<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
why it does because you have that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.900 
why it does because you have that
typical<00:02:29.780> sound<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:31.280> let's<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
typical sound but let's do it on the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.970 
typical sound but let's do it on the
white<00:02:32.090> keys

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
white keys

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.790 
white keys
the<00:02:34.490> formulism<00:02:34.970> whatever<00:02:35.870> note<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.440> start<00:02:36.710> on

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the formulism whatever note you start on

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.260 
the formulism whatever note you start on
it's<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.130> whole<00:02:37.340> step<00:02:37.550> above<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.820> then<00:02:38.240> a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
it's a whole step above that then a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.630 
it's a whole step above that then a
whole<00:02:38.480> step<00:02:38.660> above<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.440> then<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.400> fifth

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
whole step above that and then the fifth

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.550 
whole step above that and then the fifth
note<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.880> scale<00:02:41.210> and<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> six<00:02:41.840> note<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.320> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
note of scale and the six note so the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.730 
note of scale and the six note so the
first<00:02:43.070> second<00:02:43.760> third<00:02:44.060> fifth<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.900> sixth<00:02:45.530> note

first second third fifth and sixth note
of<00:02:45.950> any<00:02:46.370> major<00:02:47.300> scale<00:02:47.660> okay<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:51.050> I'm

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
of any major scale okay so if I if I'm

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.800 
of any major scale okay so if I if I'm
dealing<00:02:51.410> with<00:02:51.590> D<00:02:52.040> flat<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.450> first

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
dealing with D flat I want the first

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.270 
dealing with D flat I want the first

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.370 

playing<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.530> pentatonic<00:03:53.950> scale<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.840> get

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
playing the pentatonic scale is you get

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.670 
playing the pentatonic scale is you get
some<00:03:56.530> really<00:03:56.770> nice<00:03:57.010> sounds

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.070 

see<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.430> was<00:04:01.580> all<00:04:01.730> pentatonic<00:04:02.390> scale<00:04:02.690> I'm

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
see that was all pentatonic scale I'm

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.539 
see that was all pentatonic scale I'm
just<00:04:03.319> using<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.819> notes<00:04:05.060> 1<00:04:06.129> 5<00:04:07.129> 6<00:04:07.900> 3<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:10.250> I'm

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
just using the notes 1 5 6 3 and I'm

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.039 
just using the notes 1 5 6 3 and I'm
kind<00:04:10.819> of<00:04:10.909> turning<00:04:11.299> around<00:04:11.599> there<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.810> that

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.050 

if<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.169> want<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.410> learn<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.680> do<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:19.060> that's

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
if you want to learn to do that that's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.969 
if you want to learn to do that that's
how<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.299> do<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.720> turn<00:04:20.989> or<00:04:21.169> turn<00:04:21.560> around

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
how you do it you turn or turn around

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.240 
how you do it you turn or turn around
the<00:04:22.580> bottom<00:04:22.940> nut<00:04:23.120> then<00:04:23.870> come<00:04:24.229> down<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.830> turn

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
the bottom nut then come down and turn

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.150 
the bottom nut then come down and turn
around<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.729> bottom<00:04:26.090> out<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:26.979> okay

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
around the bottom out there okay

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.560 
around the bottom out there okay
so<00:04:28.340> there's<00:04:28.520> lots<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.820> different<00:04:28.880> sounds<00:04:29.300> you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
so there's lots of different sounds you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.110 
so there's lots of different sounds you
can<00:04:29.690> make<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> pentatonic<00:04:30.650> scale<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.340> if

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
can make on a pentatonic scale and if

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.250 
can make on a pentatonic scale and if
you<00:04:32.240> choose<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.449> play<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> black<00:04:32.990> notes

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
you choose to play on the black notes

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.740 
you choose to play on the black notes
and<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.800> can't<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.639> Black<00:04:34.910> Keys<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.360> should<00:04:35.539> say

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
and you can't on Black Keys I should say
