reel<00:02:03.829> it<00:02:04.189> clicks<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.880> pin<00:02:05.180> up<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:06.170> pin

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
reel it clicks a pin up and that pin

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.399 
reel it clicks a pin up and that pin
that's<00:02:06.829> inside<00:02:07.280> catches<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.329> line<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
that's inside catches the line and you

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.679 
that's inside catches the line and you
reel<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.769> up<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.700> that's<00:02:10.939> a<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.450> about

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689 
reel it up so that's a little bit about

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.050 
reel it up so that's a little bit about
reels<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:12.829> I'll<00:02:12.980> talk<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.459> just<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.790> tiny

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
reels now I'll talk to you just a tiny

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.049 
reels now I'll talk to you just a tiny
bit<00:02:14.360> about<00:02:14.390> lines<00:02:15.189> this<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.249> a<00:02:16.430> monofilament

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:17.059 
bit about lines this is a monofilament

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.800 
bit about lines this is a monofilament
line<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.930> what<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.769> most<00:02:19.639> of<00:02:19.819> us<00:02:19.969> saw

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
line it's what we most of us saw

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.350 
line it's what we most of us saw
when<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.020> were<00:02:21.140> kids<00:02:21.380> growing<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
when we were kids growing up it's a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.870 
when we were kids growing up it's a
single-strand<00:02:24.200> line<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.459> opaque

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
single-strand line and it's it's opaque

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.050 
single-strand line and it's it's opaque
it's<00:02:26.270> kind<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.750> clear<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.790> really

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's kind of clear and it's a really

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.640 
it's kind of clear and it's a really
good<00:02:29.209> line<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.450> use<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> lot<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:29.989> guys<00:02:30.170> like<00:02:30.200> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
good line to use a lot of guys like it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.320 
good line to use a lot of guys like it
because<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.160> really<00:02:31.489> smooth<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:32.030> lot<00:02:32.180> of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
because it's really smooth a lot of

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.670 
because it's really smooth a lot of
people<00:02:32.569> who<00:02:32.690> fish<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.590> really

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
people who fish like it it's really

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.220 
people who fish like it it's really
really<00:02:34.310> smooth<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:35.569> does<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> little<00:02:36.140> bit

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
really smooth it does have a little bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.470 
really smooth it does have a little bit
of<00:02:36.380> stretch<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.489> also<00:02:37.700> gets<00:02:38.300> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
of stretch to it and it also gets a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
of stretch to it and it also gets a
little<00:02:38.630> bit<00:02:38.870> weak<00:02:39.260> at<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.980> knots<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.670> hard

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
little bit weak at the knots it's hard

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.610 
little bit weak at the knots it's hard
to<00:02:41.030> tie<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> knot<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.540> monofilament<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.500> does

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to tie a knot in monofilament that does

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.880 
to tie a knot in monofilament that does
not<00:02:42.769> make<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.250> line<00:02:43.459> weak<00:02:44.500> however<00:02:45.500> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
not make the line weak however it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.770 
not make the line weak however it
doesn't<00:02:46.370> wear<00:02:46.550> out<00:02:46.580> your<00:02:46.970> reel<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.660> it

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
doesn't wear out your reel and it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.440 
doesn't wear out your reel and it
doesn't<00:02:48.140> wear<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.610> eyes<00:02:49.910> or<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
doesn't wear out the the eyes or the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.110 
doesn't wear out the the eyes or the
loops<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.500> rod<00:02:52.150> very<00:02:53.150> quickly<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
loops on your rod very quickly but the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
loops on your rod very quickly but the
one<00:02:56.360> type<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.780> line<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.290> really<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:57.890> to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
one type of line that I really like to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.420 
one type of line that I really like to
use<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.700> more<00:02:58.910> modern<00:02:59.330> line<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
use is the more modern line this is a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.600 
use is the more modern line this is a
braided<00:03:01.819> line<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.260> modern<00:03:03.650> line<00:03:03.890> it's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
braided line and it's a modern line it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.699 
braided line and it's a modern line it's
actually<00:03:04.910> thinner<00:03:05.480> than<00:03:05.720> monofilament<00:03:06.260> and

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
actually thinner than monofilament and

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.949 
actually thinner than monofilament and
it<00:03:07.190> has<00:03:07.400> many<00:03:07.670> strands<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.480> are<00:03:08.599> braided

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
it has many strands that are braided

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.890 
it has many strands that are braided
together<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.860> use<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.130> gray<00:03:10.630> because<00:03:11.630> it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
together and I use a gray because it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.460 
together and I use a gray because it's
really<00:03:12.260> hard<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.769> see<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.010> gray<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.760> dark

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
really hard to see the gray and the dark

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.059 
really hard to see the gray and the dark
the<00:03:15.470> darker<00:03:15.890> colors<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> water<00:03:17.290> also<00:03:18.290> when

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
the darker colors in the water also when

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.720 
the darker colors in the water also when
you<00:03:19.160> buy<00:03:19.400> say<00:03:20.000> six<00:03:20.330> or<00:03:20.450> eight<00:03:20.599> pound<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:22.250> this

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you buy say six or eight pound this this

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.120 
you buy say six or eight pound this this
line<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.239> rated<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.780> be<00:03:23.900> six<00:03:24.230> or<00:03:24.349> eight<00:03:24.530> pounds

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
line is rated to be six or eight pounds

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.550 
line is rated to be six or eight pounds
of<00:03:25.329> pressure<00:03:26.329> can<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.810> put<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.079> it<00:03:27.320> without

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
of pressure can be put on it without

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.340 
of pressure can be put on it without
breaking<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.940> most<00:03:29.329> of<00:03:29.540> your<00:03:29.690> braided<00:03:30.109> lines

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
breaking but most of your braided lines

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.400 
breaking but most of your braided lines
can<00:03:30.739> really<00:03:31.070> take<00:03:31.370> twice<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.600> much<00:03:32.810> without

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
can really take twice that much without

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.530 
can really take twice that much without
breaking<00:03:33.859> twice<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.400> much<00:03:34.549> pressure<00:03:34.850> it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
breaking twice that much pressure it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.380 
breaking twice that much pressure it
works<00:03:35.989> really<00:03:36.319> really<00:03:36.470> nice<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.180> young

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
works really really nice for a young

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.479 
works really really nice for a young
fisherman<00:03:38.630> because<00:03:39.260> if<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.590> get<00:03:39.769> hung<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.220> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
fisherman because if you get hung up and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.729 
fisherman because if you get hung up and
you're<00:03:40.910> trying<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.269> get<00:03:41.420> your<00:03:41.600> bait<00:03:41.870> out<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.260> a

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you're trying to get your bait out of a

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.610 
you're trying to get your bait out of a
tree<00:03:43.130> Liam<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.670> off<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:44.030> bottom<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:45.319> line

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
tree Liam or off the bottom this line

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.620 
tree Liam or off the bottom this line
can<00:03:45.890> hold<00:03:46.160> up<00:03:46.400> better<00:03:46.700> than<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.000> monofilament

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
can hold up better than the monofilament

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.539 
can hold up better than the monofilament
so<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.109> really<00:03:48.500> recommend<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.069> get<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.280> good

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
so I really recommend you get a good

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.990 
so I really recommend you get a good
braided<00:03:50.030> line<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:51.170> does<00:03:51.410> wear<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.000> ceramic

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
braided line it does wear the ceramic

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.830 
braided line it does wear the ceramic
eyes<00:03:53.209> out<00:03:53.510> faster<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:55.209> most<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.420> us<00:03:56.569> are<00:03:56.750> going

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
eyes out faster but most of us are going

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.319 
eyes out faster but most of us are going
to<00:03:56.959> upgrade<00:03:57.170> our<00:03:57.590> rods<00:03:57.829> it's<00:03:58.280> probably<00:03:59.030> in<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
to upgrade our rods it's probably in the

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.300 
to upgrade our rods it's probably in the
life<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.720> your<00:03:59.930> reel<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.920> life<00:04:01.130> of

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
life of your reel and in the life of

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.830 
life of your reel and in the life of
your<00:04:01.459> line<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:01.940> going<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.209> make<00:04:02.630> any

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
your line not going to make any

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.349 
your line not going to make any
difference<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:04.069> really<00:04:04.639> highly<00:04:04.760> recommend

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
difference so I really highly recommend

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.240 
difference so I really highly recommend
a<00:04:05.480> six<00:04:05.750> or<00:04:05.870> eight<00:04:05.989> pound<00:04:06.290> braided<00:04:06.620> line<00:04:06.980> and

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
a six or eight pound braided line and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.830 
a six or eight pound braided line and
it's<00:04:07.819> this<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.299> what<00:04:08.329> we're<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.720> be

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it's this is what we're going to be

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.309 
it's this is what we're going to be
using<00:04:09.200> here<00:04:09.440> fishing<00:04:10.280> spinners<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:12.049> also

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
using here fishing spinners and it also

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.160 
using here fishing spinners and it also
has<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> real<00:04:13.069> good<00:04:13.489> hooking<00:04:14.480> value<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.959> doesn't

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
has a real good hooking value it doesn't

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.699 
has a real good hooking value it doesn't
stretch<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:16.100> hooks<00:04:16.549> hard<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:18.260> can<00:04:18.410> feel

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
stretch it hooks hard and you can feel

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.840 
stretch it hooks hard and you can feel
the<00:04:18.979> line<00:04:19.220> real<00:04:19.549> well<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.239> like<00:04:20.570> using<00:04:20.810> this

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the line real well so I like using this

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.129 
the line real well so I like using this
now<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:22.910> told<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.389> I'm<00:04:23.479> going<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.660> be<00:04:23.750> using<00:04:24.050> a

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
now I told you I'm going to be using a

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.460 
now I told you I'm going to be using a
spinner<00:04:24.470> bait<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.300> I'm<00:04:26.300> using<00:04:26.720> today<00:04:26.990> I'm

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
spinner bait and I'm using today I'm

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.200 
spinner bait and I'm using today I'm
going<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.650> be<00:04:27.740> using<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.130> panther<00:04:28.610> Martin<00:04:29.030> and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
going to be using a panther Martin and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.890 
going to be using a panther Martin and
as<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.320> can<00:04:30.470> see<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:30.860> my<00:04:31.039> box<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.849> have<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.539> lot<00:04:32.870> of

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
as you can see in my box I have a lot of

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.690 
as you can see in my box I have a lot of
this<00:04:33.349> particular<00:04:33.979> pattern

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
this particular pattern

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.340 
this particular pattern
and<00:04:35.200> this<00:04:36.200> pattern<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:37.570> Panther<00:04:38.570> Martin<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.140> a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and this pattern of Panther Martin is a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.570 
and this pattern of Panther Martin is a
gold<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.430> mimics<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:42.770> mimics<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.340> brown

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
gold and it mimics a this mimics a brown

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.520 
gold and it mimics a this mimics a brown
trout<00:04:43.910> swimming<00:04:44.510> through<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.690> water<00:04:44.750> and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
trout swimming through the water and

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.470 
trout swimming through the water and
that's<00:04:46.130> what<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:46.850> mimics<00:04:47.150> anyway

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
that's what I think it mimics anyway

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.810 
that's what I think it mimics anyway
it's<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.810> really<00:04:48.140> good<00:04:48.260> pattern<00:04:48.740> most<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.700> your

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
it's a really good pattern most of your

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.060 
it's a really good pattern most of your
local<00:04:50.180> waters<00:04:50.540> have<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:51.200> particular<00:04:51.800> pattern

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
local waters have a particular pattern

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.430 
local waters have a particular pattern
that<00:04:52.370> works<00:04:52.550> well<00:04:52.820> for<00:04:52.850> them<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:54.260> a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
that works well for them and this is a

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.220 
that works well for them and this is a
pattern<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:54.920> works<00:04:55.250> well<00:04:55.550> for<00:04:55.580> me<00:04:56.230> this

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
pattern that works well for me this

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.160 
pattern that works well for me this
particular<00:04:58.070> pattern<00:04:58.570> I've<00:04:59.570> got<00:04:59.750> some<00:05:00.020> in<00:05:00.110> a

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
particular pattern I've got some in a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.220 
particular pattern I've got some in a
box<00:05:00.440> here<00:05:00.800> if<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.670> can<00:05:01.910> read<00:05:02.330> my<00:05:02.540> letters<00:05:02.990> here

box here if I can read my letters here

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:10.750 
box here if I can read my letters here
is<00:05:05.410> gy<00:05:06.410> oh<00:05:06.800> it's<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.610> number<00:05:08.390> six<00:05:08.690> pm<00:05:09.290> F<00:05:09.560> G<00:05:10.190> Y<00:05:10.370> and

local bait dealer they'll know some of

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.090 
local bait dealer they'll know some of
the<00:05:23.540> patterns<00:05:23.780> that<00:05:24.050> work<00:05:24.290> in<00:05:24.560> your<00:05:24.710> waters

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
the patterns that work in your waters

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.780 
the patterns that work in your waters
and<00:05:25.310> when<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.150> find<00:05:26.390> out<00:05:26.540> what<00:05:26.720> works<00:05:27.610> use<00:05:28.610> it

that's got a deep trough on the other

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.160 
that's got a deep trough on the other
side<00:05:41.500> from<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.680> bank<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.330> a<00:05:44.390> beautiful

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
side from the bank this is a beautiful

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.930 
side from the bank this is a beautiful
stretch<00:05:45.350> of<00:05:45.530> water<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:45.980> I<00:05:46.040> love<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.400> fish<00:05:46.670> and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
stretch of water that I love to fish and

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.260 
stretch of water that I love to fish and
we've<00:05:47.750> got<00:05:47.900> about<00:05:48.110> 20<00:05:48.650> minutes<00:05:48.700> probably<00:05:49.700> Oh

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
we've got about 20 minutes probably Oh

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.970 
we've got about 20 minutes probably Oh
15<00:05:53.270> or<00:05:53.420> 20<00:05:53.750> minutes<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:54.230> we<00:05:54.350> have<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.710> fish

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
15 or 20 minutes that we have to fish

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.720 
15 or 20 minutes that we have to fish
but<00:05:55.820> this<00:05:56.360> can<00:05:56.630> be<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.440> most<00:05:57.650> productive<00:05:57.920> time

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
but this can be the most productive time

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.170 
but this can be the most productive time
of<00:05:59.090> fishing<00:05:59.960> for<00:06:00.170> natural<00:06:00.620> Browns<00:06:00.920> so<00:06:01.580> we're

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
of fishing for natural Browns so we're

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.340 
of fishing for natural Browns so we're
going<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.330> see<00:06:02.450> if<00:06:02.510> we<00:06:02.540> can't<00:06:02.840> come<00:06:03.020> out<00:06:03.200> with

going to see if we can't come out with

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.710 
going to see if we can't come out with
one<00:06:03.560> here<00:06:03.830> I'm<00:06:04.670> going<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:04.940> work<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.300> entire

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
one here I'm going to work this entire

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.210 
one here I'm going to work this entire
stretch<00:06:06.170> right<00:06:06.470> here<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:08.380> if<00:06:09.380> there<00:06:09.860> was<00:06:09.980> sun

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
stretch right here and if there was sun

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.220 
stretch right here and if there was sun
shining<00:06:10.550> I<00:06:10.850> say<00:06:11.240> I'm<00:06:11.300> popping<00:06:11.780> here<00:06:11.930> so<00:06:12.110> they

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
shining I say I'm popping here so they

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.410 
shining I say I'm popping here so they
might<00:06:12.410> be<00:06:12.610> feeding<00:06:13.610> on<00:06:13.850> something<00:06:14.120> that's

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
might be feeding on something that's

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.560 
might be feeding on something that's
hatching<00:06:15.130> but<00:06:16.130> if<00:06:16.370> there<00:06:16.520> was<00:06:16.640> sunshine<00:06:16.910> here

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
hatching but if there was sunshine here

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.810 
hatching but if there was sunshine here
in<00:06:17.720> or<00:06:17.930> sunny<00:06:18.200> I'd<00:06:18.860> have<00:06:19.100> to<00:06:19.220> get<00:06:19.340> on<00:06:19.430> my<00:06:19.460> knees

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
in or sunny I'd have to get on my knees

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.730 
in or sunny I'd have to get on my knees
and<00:06:20.240> I<00:06:20.480> would<00:06:20.630> crawl<00:06:20.900> up<00:06:21.110> because<00:06:21.440> what<00:06:21.620> you

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
and I would crawl up because what you

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.740 
and I would crawl up because what you
want<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:22.010> do<00:06:22.160> is<00:06:22.310> make<00:06:22.490> your<00:06:22.640> profile<00:06:23.180> as<00:06:23.420> small

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
want to do is make your profile as small

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.290 
want to do is make your profile as small
as<00:06:23.960> you<00:06:24.080> can<00:06:24.110> because<00:06:25.100> if<00:06:25.340> they<00:06:25.640> see<00:06:25.700> you<00:06:26.120> they

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
as you can because if they see you they

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.360 
as you can because if they see you they
won't<00:06:26.540> bite<00:06:26.780> but<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.680> don't<00:06:27.890> think<00:06:28.070> I<00:06:28.130> have<00:06:28.250> to

won't bite but I don't think I have to

00:06:28.370 --> 00:07:08.270 
won't bite but I don't think I have to
