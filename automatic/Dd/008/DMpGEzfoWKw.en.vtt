when<00:00:59.800> I<00:00:59.829> reverse<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.400> I<00:01:00.460> need<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.820> Pat<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.150> need

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
when I reverse that I need to Pat I need

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.289 
when I reverse that I need to Pat I need
something<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:03.430> drive<00:01:03.670> this<00:01:03.880> with<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.269> I

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
something to to drive this with so I

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.120 
something to to drive this with so I
just<00:01:04.509> drive<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.780> with<00:01:05.019> friction<00:01:05.259> I'm<00:01:05.920> gonna

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
just drive it with friction I'm gonna

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.950 
just drive it with friction I'm gonna
use<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.340> piece<00:01:06.579> of<00:01:06.700> leather<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.060> find<00:01:07.840> that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
use a piece of leather I find that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.550 
use a piece of leather I find that
that's<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> right<00:01:08.710> thickness<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:11.350> I

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
that's just the right thickness and if I

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.850 
that's just the right thickness and if I
put<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> piece<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.100> wet<00:01:12.850> leather<00:01:13.680> inside<00:01:14.680> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
put a piece of wet leather inside the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.920 
put a piece of wet leather inside the
bowl<00:01:15.040> now<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.740> wet<00:01:17.950> bowl<00:01:18.700> could<00:01:19.180> pick<00:01:19.540> up<00:01:19.690> some

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
bowl now the wet bowl could pick up some

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.480 
bowl now the wet bowl could pick up some
of<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.080> color<00:01:20.290> from<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.620> leather<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.220> stain

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
of the color from the leather and stain

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.620 
of the color from the leather and stain
it<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:21.940> rather<00:01:22.510> than<00:01:23.850> using<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.060> leather<00:01:25.420> by

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
it so rather than using the leather by

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.800 
it so rather than using the leather by
itself<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.260> use<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.909> piece<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.060> paper<00:01:28.150> towel<00:01:28.479> and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
itself I use a piece of paper towel and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.830 
itself I use a piece of paper towel and
then<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.890> leather<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:31.570> I'm<00:01:31.750> gonna

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
then the leather and then I'm gonna

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.080 
then the leather and then I'm gonna
bring<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.229> up<00:01:32.350> okay<00:01:32.950> but<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.700> need<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.970> do

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
bring it up okay but I need to do

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.830 
bring it up okay but I need to do
something<00:01:34.450> first<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.460> find<00:01:37.330> out<00:01:37.479> where

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
something first I need to find out where

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.230 
something first I need to find out where
that<00:01:38.680> football<00:01:39.190> shape<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.940> inside

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
that football shape is on the inside

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.149 
that football shape is on the inside
where<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.600> inside<00:01:40.930> contour<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.070> I'm

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
where that inside contour is so I'm

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.280 
where that inside contour is so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.250> measure<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:44.280> will<00:01:45.840> come<00:01:46.840> out<00:01:46.930> here

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
gonna measure that will come out here

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.899 
gonna measure that will come out here
and<00:01:47.440> we'll<00:01:47.560> bring<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.190> over<00:01:48.430> here

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
and we'll bring that over here

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.410 
and we'll bring that over here
okay<00:01:49.869> now<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.110> inside<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.040> my<00:01:51.130> bowl<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.670> just

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420 

inside<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.860> transition<00:01:56.860> line<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.280> that's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
inside that transition line so that's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.880 
inside that transition line so that's
the<00:01:57.640> inside<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.210> bowl<00:01:58.360> all<00:01:58.750> right<00:01:58.900> let<00:01:59.860> me

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
the inside of the bowl all right let me

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
the inside of the bowl all right let me
do<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.159> one<00:02:00.220> more<00:02:00.490> time<00:02:00.520> let<00:02:00.970> me<00:02:01.060> measure

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
do that one more time let me measure

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.230 
do that one more time let me measure
measure<00:02:02.619> twice<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.010> cut<00:02:03.250> once<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.850> guess<00:02:04.060> this

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
measure twice and cut once I guess this

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.969 
measure twice and cut once I guess this
whole<00:02:04.450> philosophy<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.810> might<00:02:08.379> be<00:02:08.409> just<00:02:08.799> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
whole philosophy well I might be just a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.740 
whole philosophy well I might be just a
little<00:02:09.009> conservative<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:09.939> make<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
little conservative there this make it a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.940 
little conservative there this make it a
little<00:02:10.869> bit<00:02:11.019> fatter<00:02:11.260> about<00:02:11.530> here

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
little bit fatter about here

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.640 
little bit fatter about here
alright<00:02:12.459> that's<00:02:13.360> where<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.689> inside<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.230> okay

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
alright that's where the inside is okay

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.369 
alright that's where the inside is okay
now<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.129> need<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> wall<00:02:15.579> thickness<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:17.200> gonna

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
now I need a wall thickness I'm gonna

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.900 
now I need a wall thickness I'm gonna
make<00:02:17.529> a<00:02:17.560> second<00:02:17.950> mark<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.279> there

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 

and<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.270> need<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.750> proud<00:02:22.320> place<00:02:22.710> that's<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.130> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and I need a proud place that's going to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.620 
and I need a proud place that's going to
sit<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> table<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.480> make<00:02:24.600> a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
sit on the table so that I can make a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.650 
sit on the table so that I can make a
little<00:02:24.840> concave<00:02:25.970> section<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> bottom<00:02:27.510> my

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
dimple in here still there that was our

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.810 
dimple in here still there that was our
first<00:03:22.910> axis<00:03:23.910> where<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.240> started<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.720> with<00:03:25.110> our

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
first axis where we started it with our

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.640 
first axis where we started it with our
coat<00:03:26.820> hanger<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:28.290> still<00:03:28.440> there<00:03:28.620> so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.710 
coat hanger and it's still there so
let's<00:03:29.010> use<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.580> start<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:29.880> we<00:03:30.480> may

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
let's use that to start with we may

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.050 
let's use that to start with we may
adjust<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.590> bit<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.130> that's<00:03:32.340> gonna<00:03:32.820> be

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
adjust it just a bit but that's gonna be

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.310 
adjust it just a bit but that's gonna be
pretty<00:03:33.510> close<00:03:35.210> to<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.240> starting<00:03:36.660> point<00:03:38.000> okay<00:03:39.320> so

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
pretty close to a starting point okay so

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.790 
pretty close to a starting point okay so
I'm<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.530> gonna<00:03:40.980> sneak<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.550> up<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:42.800> tight

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
I'm just gonna sneak it up just tight

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.930 
I'm just gonna sneak it up just tight
but<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.510> holding<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.660> very<00:03:45.990> much<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:47.190> I'm

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
but not holding on very much and I'm

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.120 
but not holding on very much and I'm
gonna<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.210> my<00:03:48.330> hi-tech<00:03:48.810> thumb<00:03:49.110> here<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.620> I'm

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
gonna get my hi-tech thumb here and I'm

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.600 
gonna get my hi-tech thumb here and I'm
gonna<00:03:50.220> rotate<00:03:50.870> by<00:03:51.870> hand<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.100> can<00:03:53.340> see

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
gonna rotate by hand so that I can see

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.540 
gonna rotate by hand so that I can see
well<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.060> wobbling<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:55.050> bit<00:03:55.520> where<00:03:56.520> I

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
well it's wobbling just a bit where I

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.220 
well it's wobbling just a bit where I
need<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.850> transition<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.780> happen<00:03:58.080> up<00:03:58.200> here

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
need to transition is to happen up here

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.440 
need to transition is to happen up here
so<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.830> doesn't<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.459> perfect<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.390> I

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so this doesn't have to be perfect but I

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.360 
so this doesn't have to be perfect but I
want<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.900> pretty<00:04:01.020> close<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:02.040> because<00:04:02.340> I

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.770 
want to get it pretty close so because I
have<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.820> wobble<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.300> here<00:04:03.450> let's<00:04:03.660> sit

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780

very<00:04:21.870> slightly<00:04:22.230> I'm<00:04:23.010> not<00:04:23.280> really<00:04:23.490> gonna<00:04:23.700> move

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
very slightly I'm not really gonna move

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.330 
very slightly I'm not really gonna move
the<00:04:24.240> cone<00:04:24.480> out<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.140> hole<00:04:25.320> completely<00:04:25.620> I'm

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
the cone out of the hole completely I'm

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
the cone out of the hole completely I'm
just<00:04:26.550> going<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.760> move<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.030> part<00:04:27.930> way<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.200> of

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
just going to move it part way out of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.460 
just going to move it part way out of
the<00:04:28.380> hole<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.090> then<00:04:30.090> push<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.510> in<00:04:30.600> again<00:04:30.750> so

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
the hole and then push it in again so

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.560 
the hole and then push it in again so
that<00:04:31.650> it'll<00:04:31.830> rear<00:04:32.160> edge<00:04:32.340> astir<00:04:32.640> into<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> better

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
that it'll rear edge astir into a better

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.610 
that it'll rear edge astir into a better
position

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
position

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.550 
position
pushing<00:04:35.220> down<00:04:35.460> with<00:04:36.030> my<00:04:36.389> thumb<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
pushing down with my thumb like this and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.640 
pushing down with my thumb like this and
then<00:04:38.010> tighten<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.370> back<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:38.550> again

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
then tighten it back up again

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.920 
then tighten it back up again
there<00:04:40.650> we<00:04:40.740> go<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.010> I'm<00:04:41.130> pretty<00:04:41.310> true<00:04:41.610> now<00:04:41.930> just

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
there we go so I'm pretty true now just

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.070 
there we go so I'm pretty true now just
a<00:04:43.050> hair<00:04:43.260> off<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.970> really<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.660> doesn't<00:04:45.870> have

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
a hair off but really this doesn't have

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.480 
a hair off but really this doesn't have
to<00:04:46.139> be<00:04:46.320> perfect<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.889> here<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
to be perfect it's here that the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.040 
to be perfect it's here that the
transition<00:04:47.970> needs<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.240> be<00:04:48.330> as<00:04:48.419> best<00:04:48.660> we<00:04:48.750> can

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
transition needs to be as best we can

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.710 
transition needs to be as best we can
okay<00:04:49.729> all<00:04:50.729> right<00:04:50.880> now<00:04:51.060> how<00:04:51.300> tight<00:04:51.540> do<00:04:51.690> I

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
okay all right now how tight do I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.120 
okay all right now how tight do I
tighten<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:53.960> not<00:04:54.960> quite<00:04:55.229> tight<00:04:55.470> enough<00:04:55.500> if<00:04:55.979> I'm

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
tighten it not quite tight enough if I'm

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.480 
tighten it not quite tight enough if I'm
holding<00:04:56.310> onto<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:57.229> spindle<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.190> can<00:04:59.370> move

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
holding onto the spindle and I can move

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.990 
holding onto the spindle and I can move
it<00:04:59.699> the<00:05:00.660> friction<00:05:01.080> drive<00:05:01.530> isn't<00:05:02.000> friction

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
it the friction drive isn't friction

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000 
it the friction drive isn't friction
enough<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.510> I'm<00:05:03.600> going<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.780> maybe<00:05:04.169> quarter

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
enough so I'm going to maybe quarter

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.160 
enough so I'm going to maybe quarter
turn<00:05:05.479> it's<00:05:06.479> probably<00:05:06.990> enough<00:05:07.229> just<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.800> hear
