00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.929
 noises as we sell everything to the minute there is need to produce more cubaity 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:17.919
 of products 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.330
 so I normally hahaha 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050
 at least a dozen TV introduction products 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.659
 orthopedic parcels are replicated continuously so that 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.269
 el practically we manage to cover the whole year with an average of no 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.789
 from 10 to 15 products 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:36.890
 at the same time 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.899
 we produce mainly 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.309
 ebook - pea strawberries and the tuche canasten 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.780
 diet spinach 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 we have the zucchini we collected last year the we have to 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.750
 warehouse 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 chicory 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.850
 I think in the preparation of summer cultures 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.239
 that is, aubergine and peppers tomatoes outside and inside the greenhouses 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.990
 to take advantage of me a little 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.110
 for this it is a cipher that is perpetuated over the years systematically m 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.810
 we know 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.780
 that there are times when they go away with some things we sing and then to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 We hope to sell it daily 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.570
 this guarantees the consumer a wider range of products 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.740
 possible as long as possible 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.580
 clearly 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.560
 Australian helmet. wood - I only love our products this goes 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.170
 say 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.299
 because you should not produce 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.940
 . 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.350
 we are in navigation another farmer who eventually and at regime 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.170
 biological re integrates with our company the products that we do not do 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.759
 so for example the carrots the next melloni 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.479
 some eggplants or other human figures in the green 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.899
 in the periods he produces he is so we have combined a wide range of products 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.500
 that console or. wilde 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.840
 this evening in particular present 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.210
 we have zucchini 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.290
 % are daikins and books you have to die this hybrid 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.140
 what color should have both courgette and flower 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.880
 pelagio that we do not let it grow to a height of almost 2 meters 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640
 otherwise it would be destroyed because as you can see king would become a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.199
 forest and unmanageable orkuy would dress if there is that rebecca 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.429
 because it perishes on average 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:35.069
 to lengthen its collection to take full advantage of an investment that of a greenhouse 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.259
 nylon 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:37.650
 and anything else too 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.710
 our lawn is an engraved our greenhouses are unheated are 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.560
 always cold 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.619
 firm on the provence evelyn somehow from the weather 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.229
 the cultures we put below 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.629
 this toour does not allow for first fruits 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.849
 we are unable to complete horticultural crops 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.929
 a month before the external ones proservice because a 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.019
 advantage a little bit the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.039
 the collection of the mass-selling tea 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.789
 I have things that would otherwise not be consumed. I give the example of 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.529
 greenhouse zucchine vessel 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.699
 February is planted and the apple of March is noticed, end of March 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.350
 and outside the first of mid-May 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.769
 at the end of May we would not have for which it is precisely that it needs 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.759
 have protected cultures 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.769
 we use cold greenhouses as a culture so we do not intervene with 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.110
 other heating 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.860
 strange gadgets that can heat pambieri can be seen present in 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.349
 clearly perkins were stern cultures 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.569
 no it is not advisable to make a potato swap 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.059
 just to put a direct line on the need to have kings 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:48.089
 products as long as possible this case gave from a fact 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.390
 it rained we couldn't sing all together 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.610
 but we have two plants with tvd, look at one later in the vegetation 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.580
 therefore you will arrive first 1 anyway I am here in front of you that will arrive much more 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.299
 late d 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.849
 other 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.179
 this also occurs in the hills 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:09.029
 otherwise we plant 500 meters every 15 days which then serve pearls 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.329
 lengthen the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.309
 the harvest time 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.959
 I want to show myself as a potato plant because not everyone knows what it is 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.189
 potato and how it comes 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.310
 ava dava was born in topford r 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.879
 ebay a swelling of the root 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.879
 of potato saucer voted for him on media monkey 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.730
 his we are lucky I dig it and show you where they are 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:34.139
 1 don't find anything because we don't find it danielle steel 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.409
 and let's try to show you why 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.050
 how to break a potato 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.050
 watch 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.499
 president here is clear 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.659
 for children. sometimes they don't know 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.309
 what is a potato 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.650
 pata pata practically a swelling of the root 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.969
 see the potato plant 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.199
 clear reckli that attack look how you should 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.469
 now the roots present a good production of caregivers 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.750
 it happens on loose soils clearly for which the root lengthens the fra 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.650
 many 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.599
 the swellings are therefore many. 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.599
 prepared also 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.159
 I don't know if here below we will find chips and queens 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.270
 sorry if they are disconnected 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.199
 from the pagoda I pulled 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.559
 how to see there on the easy even another thing below 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.059
 the ballad of bo and eaten 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.120
 that this when she arrived 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.100
 when it grows old it becomes the mother of the plant that is this one 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.039
 present this are seedlings see 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.300
 this is a piece of plant at the beginning of the plant and this is here and his 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.129
 reserve for the first time 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.469
 nothing in sicilian time 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.599
 when the peasants of the past 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.150
 they made potatoes or no water 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.369
 oo whatever else there was no rain 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.600
 this is lost was the first 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.809
 plant nutrition 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:00.919
 this piece here 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.099
 of the old is the first nutrition of the plant the strawberries are a product 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.610
 particularly peach cannot be preserved 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.379
 for which it has a great perishability 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.919
 but we succeed in membrane is a lot of go just scream you need 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.469
 today these can be eaten safely 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:19.879
 to welcome eating without any problem 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:25.769
 the collection times are around let's say a month and a month and a half for which 

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:28.150
 and very content over time 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.940
 we translate at the end of May 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.720
 from the middle of March to the end of May, however, internal production outside is 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.720
 concludes the cycle 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.900
 so we plant it July August of the year before harvesting 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.210
 we keep it all winter 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.339
 we are ripe for spring
