how<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.640> clean<00:00:06.029> up<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.330> parts<00:00:06.720> now<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.799> might

how I clean up the parts now this might
be<00:00:08.099> self-explanatory<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.809> not<00:00:10.019> enough

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
be self-explanatory but it's not enough

be self-explanatory but it's not enough
to<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.500> dismantle<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> engine<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.790> wipe

one<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> engines<00:00:27.660> had<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> real<00:00:28.260> major

problem with the steam chest and this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
problem with the steam chest and this
wasn't<00:00:30.900> apparent<00:00:31.529> until<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.009> removed<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
wasn't apparent until I removed the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.490 
wasn't apparent until I removed the
paint<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:33.090> quite<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.809> parts<00:00:34.140> fell<00:00:34.380> off

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

paint then quite a lot of parts fell off
the<00:00:34.649> engine<00:00:35.329> here<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.510> dismantling<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the engine here I'm dismantling the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
the engine here I'm dismantling the
steam<00:00:37.469> chest<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.460> steam<00:00:38.700> chest<00:00:39.000> looks

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
steam chest and the steam chest looks

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
steam chest and the steam chest looks
quite<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.510> nothing<00:00:40.320> seems<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.770> broken<00:00:40.980> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
quite good nothing seems to be broken on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.779 
quite good nothing seems to be broken on
it<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> valve<00:00:42.719> rod<00:00:42.960> gland

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
it and here it is the valve rod gland

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.979 
it and here it is the valve rod gland
I'll<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> closer<00:00:45.300> look<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I'll have a closer look at all the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
I'll have a closer look at all the
components<00:00:46.680> these<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> cross<00:00:47.700> head

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
components these are the cross head

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.709 
components these are the cross head
guides<00:00:48.200> that's<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> steam<00:00:49.590> chest<00:00:49.890> cover<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
guides that's the steam chest cover and

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
guides that's the steam chest cover and
this<00:00:51.719> again<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> steam<00:00:52.770> chest<00:00:53.039> itself<00:00:53.489> I'm

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this again is the steam chest itself I'm

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
this again is the steam chest itself I'm
cleaning<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.070> flapper<00:00:56.370> wheel

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
cleaning this up using a flapper wheel

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.840 
cleaning this up using a flapper wheel
on<00:00:56.969> my<00:00:57.000> mini<00:00:57.570> drill<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.160> very<00:00:59.340> brutal

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
on my mini drill this is not very brutal

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
on my mini drill this is not very brutal
at<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.120> unlike<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> grinding<00:01:01.410> wheel<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
at all unlike the grinding wheel as you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.570 
at all unlike the grinding wheel as you
see<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> quite<00:01:03.000> brutal<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:05.250> using

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
see here which is quite brutal I'm using

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
see here which is quite brutal I'm using
this<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> remove<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:06.510> lumps<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.080> casting

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this to remove some lumps on the casting

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
this to remove some lumps on the casting
I<00:01:07.860> noticed<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> first<00:01:09.299> looked<00:01:09.540> at

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
I noticed these when I first looked at

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
I noticed these when I first looked at
the<00:01:09.780> engine<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:11.010> never

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the engine because they were never

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
the engine because they were never
removed<00:01:11.670> before<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> engine<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.600> painted

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
removed before the engine was painted

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
removed before the engine was painted
it's<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> major<00:01:14.340> problem<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.720> like

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's not a major problem but I do like

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's not a major problem but I do like
things<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> look<00:01:16.500> pretty<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> by<00:01:18.270> grinding

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
things to look pretty and so by grinding

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
things to look pretty and so by grinding
off<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> lumps<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.860> should<00:01:20.100> give<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> much

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
off the lumps it should give a much

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
off the lumps it should give a much
better<00:01:20.759> finish<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> engine<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.170> it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
better finish to the engine when it's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.820 
better finish to the engine when it's
finally<00:01:22.560> painted<00:01:23.990> there<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.110> quite<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> few<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
finally painted there are quite a few of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
finally painted there are quite a few of
these<00:01:25.979> lumps<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> bumps<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> castings<00:01:27.509> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
these lumps and bumps on the castings so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
these lumps and bumps on the castings so
spending<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> few<00:01:28.710> minutes<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.189> cleaning

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spending a few minutes just cleaning

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.399 
spending a few minutes just cleaning
them<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.600> engine<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:30.990> look<00:01:31.200> better

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
them up and the engine will look better

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.780 
them up and the engine will look better
when<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.770> fully<00:01:31.950> painted

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
when it's fully painted

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.310 
when it's fully painted
this<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.090> underside<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.810> one<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
this is the underside of one of the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.830 
this is the underside of one of the
cross<00:01:36.560> head<00:01:36.770> guides<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.000> these<00:01:38.210> bumps<00:01:38.630> won't

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
cross head guides so these bumps won't

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.020 
cross head guides so these bumps won't
show<00:01:39.079> very<00:01:39.320> much<00:01:39.530> anyway<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:40.640> I'm<00:01:40.789> still

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
show very much anyway but I'm still

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.050 
show very much anyway but I'm still
cleaning<00:01:41.299> them<00:01:41.659> up<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> grinder

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
cleaning them up with the grinder

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.789 
cleaning them up with the grinder
when<00:01:44.060> using<00:01:44.270> grinding<00:01:44.869> wheels<00:01:45.079> even<00:01:45.350> small

look and see how but the pitting is on
the<00:02:54.590> connecting<00:02:55.040> rod<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.459> yes<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.180> pretty<00:02:56.450> bad

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
the connecting rod and yes is pretty bad

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.140 
the connecting rod and yes is pretty bad
so<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.920> thought<00:02:58.130> I'd<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> quick<00:02:58.700> look<00:02:58.910> at

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
so I thought I'd have a quick look at

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.630

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in very bad condition but it's a good

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.830 
in very bad condition but it's a good
idea<00:03:03.800> while<00:03:04.310> we're<00:03:04.490> at<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.760> stage<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.390> reface

it and just rubbing it back and forth on

some machine oil on it and it's a good

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.729 
some machine oil on it and it's a good
idea<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.940> rub<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:14.870> direction<00:03:15.080> which

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
idea to rub it in this direction which

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.590 
idea to rub it in this direction which
is<00:03:15.920> in<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> opposite<00:03:16.670> direction<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.360> way

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
is in the opposite direction to the way

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.570 
is in the opposite direction to the way
that<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> valve<00:03:18.200> normally<00:03:18.709> moves<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.250> the

valve chest slide valves generally wear

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.110 
valve chest slide valves generally wear

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
can the port face so I'll have a quick

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.640 
can the port face so I'll have a quick
look<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.269> valve<00:03:29.510> face<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.350> cylinder

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
look at the valve face on the cylinder

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.479 
look at the valve face on the cylinder
now<00:03:31.900> miraculously<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.590> valve<00:03:33.830> face<00:03:34.130> on<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
now miraculously the valve face on this

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.940 
now miraculously the valve face on this
engine<00:03:34.910> is<00:03:35.060> not<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.450> bad<00:03:35.600> condition<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.769> here

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
engine is not in bad condition so here

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.190 
engine is not in bad condition so here
I'm<00:03:37.100> using<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.489> piece<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.850> wood<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.269> again<00:03:38.930> some

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
I'm using a piece of wood and again some

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.930 
I'm using a piece of wood and again some
wet<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.500> dry<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.920> paper<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.550> little<00:03:40.700> oil

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
wet to dry some paper and a little oil

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.600 
wet to dry some paper and a little oil
to<00:03:41.690> clean<00:03:41.900> up<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.170> valve<00:03:42.380> face<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.950> as<00:03:43.489> you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
to clean up the valve face and as you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.199 
to clean up the valve face and as you
can<00:03:43.760> see<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.690> pretty<00:03:44.959> good<00:03:45.640> cast<00:03:46.640> iron<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.150> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
can see it is pretty good cast iron is a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.150 
can see it is pretty good cast iron is a
very<00:03:47.540> hard-wearing<00:03:48.050> material<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:48.950> steam

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
very hard-wearing material for steam

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.740 
very hard-wearing material for steam
engine<00:03:49.489> cylinders<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.330> does<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.720> one

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
engine cylinders but it does have one

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.650 
engine cylinders but it does have one
minor<00:03:51.290> disadvantage<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.450> you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
minor disadvantage and that is if you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.479 
minor disadvantage and that is if you
leave<00:03:53.870> water<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.620> steam<00:03:54.860> chest<00:03:55.190> or<00:03:55.459> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
leave water in the steam chest or the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.460 
leave water in the steam chest or the
cylinder<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:56.510> will<00:03:56.750> go<00:03:56.959> rusty

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
cylinder it will go rusty

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.280 
cylinder it will go rusty
and<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.550> have<00:03:58.730> rust<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.750> port<00:04:00.019> face

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and if you have rust on the port face

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.640 
and if you have rust on the port face
this<00:04:01.070> will<00:04:01.370> score<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.910> valve<00:04:02.170> which<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.380> turn

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
this will score the valve which in turn

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.870 
this will score the valve which in turn
will<00:04:04.250> then<00:04:04.489> score<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.060> port<00:04:05.420> face

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
will then score the port face

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.180 
will then score the port face
over<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.720> years<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.080> have<00:04:08.260> seen<00:04:08.500> some<00:04:08.770> very<00:04:08.980> bad

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
over the years I have seen some very bad

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.760 
over the years I have seen some very bad
examples<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> but<00:04:10.930> luckily<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.590> this

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
examples of this but luckily on this

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.700 
examples of this but luckily on this
engine<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.370> poor<00:04:12.580> face<00:04:12.820> is<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.180> good<00:04:13.330> order

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
engine the poor face is in good order

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.500 
engine the poor face is in good order
the<00:04:14.710> poor<00:04:14.920> face<00:04:15.190> no<00:04:15.430> longer<00:04:15.790> has<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.239> just

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
the poor face no longer has that just

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.449 
the poor face no longer has that just
machine<00:04:16.989> look<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.100> little<00:04:18.250> bit

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
machine look and it's a little bit

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.290 
machine look and it's a little bit
tarnished<00:04:18.790> but<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.420> will<00:04:19.570> be<00:04:19.720> fine

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
tarnished but it will be fine

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.610 
tarnished but it will be fine
