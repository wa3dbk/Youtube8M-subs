00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
with your device powered on the main way

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.020 
with your device powered on the main way
is<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.440> actually<00:00:10.590> control<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.490> sound<00:00:11.790> through

the volume keys on the side of the
device<00:00:14.460> pressing<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> up<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.660> down<00:00:16.410> you'll

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
device pressing it up and down you'll

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.260 
device pressing it up and down you'll
see<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> moment<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.520> adjusting<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
see at the moment we're adjusting the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
see at the moment we're adjusting the
ringer<00:00:18.660> volume<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> music

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
ringer volume but if you're in the music

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
ringer volume but if you're in the music
application<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.420> would<00:00:21.539> adjust<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.230> sound

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
application that would adjust the sound

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.060 
application that would adjust the sound
volume<00:00:23.240> there<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.500> quick<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
volume there so that's a quick way of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
volume there so that's a quick way of
doing<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> although<00:00:27.119> there's<00:00:27.480> more<00:00:28.289> advanced

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
doing it although there's more advanced

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.139 
doing it although there's more advanced
way<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:29.070> clicking<00:00:29.130> menu<00:00:31.160> settings<00:00:32.160> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
way by clicking menu settings and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.870 
way by clicking menu settings and
clicking<00:00:33.540> sound<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> full<00:00:35.550> range

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
clicking sound here we have a full range

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.190 
clicking sound here we have a full range
of<00:00:36.710> controls<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.899> sounds<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
of controls over the sounds on the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.069 
of controls over the sounds on the
device<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.160> starting<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.090> silent<00:00:42.899> mode

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
device so starting off with silent mode

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
device so starting off with silent mode
so<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> where<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.100> switch<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.730> sounds

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so this is where we switch all sounds

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.889 
so this is where we switch all sounds
from<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> device<00:00:46.559> off<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.030> might<00:00:48.510> only<00:00:48.750> be

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
from the device off and it might only be

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.950 
from the device off and it might only be
vibrate<00:00:49.710> mode<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.690> switch

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
vibrate mode then only so you can switch

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
vibrate mode then only so you can switch
that<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that on and off here we then have the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
that on and off here we then have the
vibrate<00:00:55.170> option<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.550> decide<00:00:56.879> when

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
vibrate option and we can decide when

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.290 
vibrate option and we can decide when
that<00:00:57.449> comes<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> always<00:00:59.300> even

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that comes on so you can always even

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.939 
that comes on so you can always even
when<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> sounds<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
when the sounds are on we can have it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.750 
when the sounds are on we can have it
never<00:01:02.190> come<00:01:02.460> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
never come on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.719 
never come on
only<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.210> silent<00:01:03.690> mode<00:01:03.870> only<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
only in silent mode only when not in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.820 
only in silent mode only when not in
silent<00:01:06.150> motes<00:01:06.330> those<00:01:06.630> options<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
silent motes those options are up to you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030 
silent motes those options are up to you
and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.430> select<00:01:09.210> those<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.860> then

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and you can select those you then

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
and you can select those you then
control<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> volume<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.740> you've<00:01:13.740> got

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
control the volume here and you've got

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.179 
control the volume here and you've got
different<00:01:14.340> volumes<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:16.189> control

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
different volumes that we can control

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
different volumes that we can control
and<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.470> ringtone<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.369> calls<00:01:21.710> medias

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and so the ringtone for calls medias

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.179 
and so the ringtone for calls medias
that<00:01:22.799> could<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.100> music<00:01:24.080> we<00:01:25.080> scroll<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that could be music we scroll up and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
that could be music we scroll up and
down<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.580> we've<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> alarm<00:01:27.180> volume<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
down then we've got the alarm volume and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
down then we've got the alarm volume and
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.020> choose<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.829> change<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.270> you
