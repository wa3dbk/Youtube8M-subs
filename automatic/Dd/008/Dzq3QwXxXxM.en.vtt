after a coal mine I could take at least
one<00:01:11.939> Fire<00:01:12.150> Blast<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
one Fire Blast but this is the this is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.590 
one Fire Blast but this is the this is
the<00:01:14.310> proof<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> pudding<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.420> here

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the proof in the pudding right here

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
the proof in the pudding right here
let's<00:01:15.780> try<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> live<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
let's try this out can I live it can I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
let's try this out can I live it can I
live<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.780> live<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> awesomely<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.220> like

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
live it I do I live it awesomely so like

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.120 
live it I do I live it awesomely so like
yes<00:01:20.900> focus<00:01:21.900> blast<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> face<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
yes focus blast to the face and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
yes focus blast to the face and
hopefully<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> kills<00:01:24.000> after<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.420> call<00:01:24.689> mind

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
hopefully that kills after one call mind

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.530 
hopefully that kills after one call mind
I'm<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.820> about<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.270> don't

one<00:04:43.240> or<00:04:43.330> is<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.480> even<00:04:43.690> each<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.020> its<00:04:44.110> frozen

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
one or is it even each of its frozen

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.590 
one or is it even each of its frozen
does<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.830> have<00:04:44.980> like<00:04:45.130> tubes<00:04:45.760> going<00:04:46.210> into<00:04:46.450> its

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
does it have like tubes going into its

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.050 
does it have like tubes going into its
veins<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.350> feed<00:04:47.590> itself<00:04:47.950> maybe<00:04:48.310> for<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
veins to feed itself maybe for the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.790 
veins to feed itself maybe for the
leftovers<00:04:49.630> this<00:04:50.290> would<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.440> somewhere

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800
