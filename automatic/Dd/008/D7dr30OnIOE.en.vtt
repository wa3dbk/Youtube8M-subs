hair to remain calm and not frizz and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.360 
hair to remain calm and not frizz and
get<00:03:13.190> all<00:03:13.660> crazy<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.930> me<00:03:15.080> with<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.830> stuff<00:03:16.160> I

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
get all crazy on me with this stuff I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.100 
get all crazy on me with this stuff I
feel<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.940> really<00:03:17.209> really<00:03:17.570> really<00:03:17.600> helps

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
feel like it really really really helps

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.840 
feel like it really really really helps
and<00:03:18.260> what's<00:03:18.739> even<00:03:18.830> better<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.610> price

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
and what's even better is the price

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.400 
and what's even better is the price
point<00:03:20.150> for<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:20.750> two<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.230> three

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
point for this is like two to three

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.110 
point for this is like two to three
dollars<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.800> bottle<00:03:22.160> depending<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.850> where<00:03:23.000> you

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
dollars a bottle depending on where you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.470 
dollars a bottle depending on where you
get<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:24.320> can't<00:03:24.530> beat<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:26.269> my

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
get it you can't beat that and in my

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.240 
get it you can't beat that and in my
opinion<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:27.769> good<00:03:28.040> deal

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
opinion this is like a really good deal

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.120 
opinion this is like a really good deal
and<00:03:28.750> again<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.780> just<00:03:29.900> think<00:03:30.170> Moroccan<00:03:30.709> oil<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:31.100> a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
and again I just think Moroccan oil is a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.570 
and again I just think Moroccan oil is a
really<00:03:31.519> nice<00:03:31.760> oil<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.720> use<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:34.130> back<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.489> this

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
really nice oil to use the back of this

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.770 
really nice oil to use the back of this

you get out of the shower lotion it
definitely<00:05:19.450> feels<00:05:19.660> kind<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.169> replenishing

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
definitely feels kind of replenishing

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.010 
definitely feels kind of replenishing
and<00:05:21.250> refreshing<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.270> smell<00:05:22.600> I<00:05:22.630> think<00:05:22.930> is

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
and refreshing and the smell I think is

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.170 
and refreshing and the smell I think is
really<00:05:23.230> what<00:05:23.440> gets<00:05:23.620> me<00:05:23.919> ultimately<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.910> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
really what gets me ultimately is the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.350 
really what gets me ultimately is the
smell<00:05:25.450> but<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.410> know<00:05:26.980> it<00:05:27.250> won't<00:05:27.669> last<00:05:27.820> all<00:05:28.120> day

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
smell but you know it won't last all day

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.330 
smell but you know it won't last all day
but<00:05:28.570> it's<00:05:29.350> there<00:05:29.590> for<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.860> couple<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.220> hours

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
but it's there for a couple of hours

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.050 
but it's there for a couple of hours
afterwards<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.419> again<00:05:32.080> it's<00:05:32.380> just<00:05:32.800> I<00:05:33.130> really

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
afterwards and again it's just I really

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.950 
afterwards and again it's just I really
am<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.510> impressed<00:05:34.720> with<00:05:35.350> these<00:05:35.560> professional
