00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.180
 covered in mud that is dimmy and today the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.960
 test drive motorization will be at 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.390
 backwards 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.090
 then you see what he has done for 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.920
 dunes it 's time to talk about it and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.329
 show what it is that this car so 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.050
 small is able 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.820
 small but abused click and want more 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.310
 abused I think the saying that people 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.380
 could use it would be who sees it face does not see 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.010
 I wish we could see the team so 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.170
 little like that and have not imagined 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.019
 how brave this car is a quietly 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.239
 invoked a whisper invoked you reduce 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.980
 the march in him with him reduced and he 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.870
 Become a lion. 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.730
 the car you and because it is very light 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920
 Can you walk very well in the sand? 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.710
 can walk very well on the trans dune 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.360
 transpose water without problem walks in the mud 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.970
 it's really a stand that you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.010
 can walk on a day-to-day basis can 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.420
 work can take the child in the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.760
 college it is easy to park 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
 little economic and at the end of 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.380
 you can make a trail and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 I would even say that a daughter in shell 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.340
 thick 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.900
 on this city off road circuit 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.490
 it works fine it works 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.070
 very clearly it does not have a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.560
 comfort of a sedan or the network itself 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.540
 normal a walking car but you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 Can walk quietly in it 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.160
 one swaying inside you walking in the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.770
 asphalt or pavement in the city but nothing 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.170
 Who unbuttons the car and you have a car 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.760
 practical and economical little 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.130
 also walk at the weekend and do 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.320
 a trail track you've already checked 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.540
 a piece but worth it after 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
 give so much mud flying a little 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.170
 a bit of sand a little bit of asphalt 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.910
 all this here in the motorization with 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.210
 henrique oliveira on the team of 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.210
 suzuki 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.270
 Johnny he has five versions party 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.730
 from ms is the team fol o was written o 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.440
 forfun and powdered mouth 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.440
 this team that you are seeing there 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.420
 the test drive motorization was performed 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.390
 in a sand dune lagoon circuit 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.810
 and also lots of mud in a quick stroll 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.090
 you can tell that the team is small but 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.220
 quite racy it is a car that does not 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.350
 the engine has a lot of power 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.940
 valves of 85 horses you do not have a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.460
 very large power but at the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.560
 you use the reduced resource and you 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.750
 give you enough torque and you can 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 to cross obstacles like sand people saw 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.270
 passing there in the sand quite slowly 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.310
 you can not not stand by you 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.050
 do not miss a touch if you have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.630
 reduced you are in a second gear and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.880
 can walk very slowly by transposing the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.990
 transpose last eia water pass 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.990
 mud without any problem 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.760
 the team has 1.3 aluminum engine 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 liter with 16 valves 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.739
 Variable gasoline intake with 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.530
 power of 85 horses 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.930
 this variable control technology makes it 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.690
 that the engine has quick answers 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.819
 acceleration and startup together with 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.760
 sequential multipoint electronic injection 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.349
 and the ignition mapped system that contributes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.730
 to reduce fuel consumption 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.730
 and the emission of pollutants 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.540
 I think it's an interesting option is the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 the best frame by frame that we have 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.520
 in an interesting market where jipinho 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.970
 the versatility he has for being 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.560
 small economy in consumption and space 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.150
 you find space to park in 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.360
 every place it's a pretty car 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.370
 interesting within the segment and 144 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.710
 compact I think he deserves a note 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.010
 very good I would give him a grade 8 and 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.010
 medium 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.890
 and to seize now the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.610
 summer we will enjoy to buy the 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.230
 jingle motor 1.3 16 balls he makes in 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.660
 between 9 and 10 kilometers with a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.340
 liter here and it has in the version 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.310
 is simpler and has the version 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.540
 Most of them already come with electric glass 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:35.340
 electric rearview mirror 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 he walks 4244 and 144 reduced
