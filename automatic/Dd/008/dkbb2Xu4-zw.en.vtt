00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.360 
think of me trying to figure out how I
want<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.599> go<00:03:34.720> about<00:03:34.930> maintaining<00:03:35.410> my<00:03:35.739> ends<00:03:36.040> now

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
want to go about maintaining my ends now

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.550 
want to go about maintaining my ends now
because<00:03:37.359> while<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:37.599> noticing<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.199> that<00:03:38.260> I'm

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
because while I'm noticing is that I'm

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.039 
because while I'm noticing is that I'm
not<00:03:38.769> retaining<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.730> length<00:03:40.000> bed<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.780> probably

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
not retaining the length bed I probably

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.020 
not retaining the length bed I probably
should<00:03:41.560> be<00:03:41.769> at<00:03:41.949> right<00:03:42.190> now<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:42.790> I'm

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
should be at right now because I'm

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.949 
should be at right now because I'm
noticing<00:03:43.419> that<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.430> grow<00:03:45.430> my<00:03:45.459> hair<00:03:45.959> i'll

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
noticing that is I grow my hair i'll

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.509 
noticing that is I grow my hair i'll
grow<00:03:47.169> my<00:03:47.319> hair<00:03:47.349> out<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.889> then<00:03:47.980> i<00:03:48.069> won't<00:03:48.310> like

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
grow my hair out and then i won't like

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.039 
grow my hair out and then i won't like
the<00:03:48.669> way<00:03:48.760> my<00:03:48.790> ends<00:03:49.239> look<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.660> then<00:03:49.750> I'll<00:03:49.810> cut

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
the way my ends look and then I'll cut

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.110 
the way my ends look and then I'll cut
it<00:03:50.079> back<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.530> I'm<00:03:50.650> growing<00:03:51.160> cutting<00:03:51.669> growing

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
it back so I'm growing cutting growing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640 
it back so I'm growing cutting growing
cutting<00:03:52.449> I've<00:03:52.599> been<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.139> lens<00:03:53.470> for

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
cutting I've been at this lens for

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.470 
cutting I've been at this lens for
almost<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:54.129> year<00:03:54.190> now<00:03:54.370> which<00:03:54.819> are<00:03:55.090> probably

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
almost a year now which are probably

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.890 
almost a year now which are probably
should<00:03:55.750> be<00:03:55.930> passed<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.940> I'm<00:03:58.389> going<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:58.629> figure

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
should be passed so I'm going to figure

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.909 
should be passed so I'm going to figure
out<00:03:59.109> ways<00:03:59.500> that<00:04:00.040> i<00:04:00.250> want<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.790> start<00:04:01.919> retaining

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
out ways that i want to start retaining

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.670 
out ways that i want to start retaining
my<00:04:03.190> length<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.760> then<00:04:04.120> maintaining<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
my length and then maintaining in so

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.699 
my length and then maintaining in so
that's<00:04:06.489> all<00:04:06.909> a<00:04:06.940> part<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.449> your<00:04:08.229> hair<00:04:08.500> journey

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
that's all a part of your hair journey

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.289 
that's all a part of your hair journey
and<00:04:08.979> figuring<00:04:09.430> out<00:04:09.430> certain<00:04:09.849> things<00:04:09.940> because

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
and figuring out certain things because

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.930 
and figuring out certain things because
now<00:04:10.690> but<00:04:11.019> getting<00:04:11.979> the<00:04:12.159> length<00:04:12.489> isn't<00:04:12.729> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
now but getting the length isn't the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.809 
now but getting the length isn't the
problem<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.569> maintaining<00:04:14.560> my<00:04:14.919> ends<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:15.790> me

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
problem it's maintaining my ends for me

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.229 
problem it's maintaining my ends for me
