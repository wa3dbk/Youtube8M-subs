generous bankers to take the tools that

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.670 
generous bankers to take the tools that
we've<00:02:00.729> learned<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.390> successful<00:02:02.259> initiatives

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
we've learned the successful initiatives

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.790 
we've learned the successful initiatives
that<00:02:02.770> we've<00:02:02.950> seen

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
that we've seen

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.680 
that we've seen
in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.070> seminar<00:02:04.430> those<00:02:04.550> lessons<00:02:04.940> across<00:02:05.390> all

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
in the seminar those lessons across all

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.000 
in the seminar those lessons across all
of<00:02:05.840> those<00:02:05.900> different<00:02:06.230> business<00:02:06.530> units

of those different business units

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.270 
of those different business units
I<00:02:08.140> think<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.200> key<00:02:09.410> attributes<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.010> being<00:02:10.220> a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
I think the key attributes to being a

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.760 
I think the key attributes to being a
successful<00:02:10.790> general<00:02:11.210> inspector<00:02:11.710> there<00:02:12.710> are

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
successful general inspector there are

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.410 
successful general inspector there are
three<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.040> them<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.370> think<00:02:13.550> number<00:02:13.820> one<00:02:14.090> you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
three of them I think number one you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.820 
three of them I think number one you
have<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.170> willingness<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.770> desire

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
have to have the willingness and desire

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.880 
have to have the willingness and desire
to<00:02:16.160> learn<00:02:16.310> number<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.510> being<00:02:18.080> adaptable<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
to learn number two being adaptable and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.790 
to learn number two being adaptable and
flexible<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.610> changes<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.360> I'm<00:02:21.050> three<00:02:21.290> being

flexible to changes and I'm three being

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.120

you want to be successful throughout
your<00:02:40.010> journey<00:02:40.510> importantly<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.600> think<00:02:41.750> you

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
your journey importantly I think you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.540 
your journey importantly I think you
need<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.050> be<00:02:42.140> able<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.320> communicate<00:02:42.770> with<00:02:43.220> a

need to be able to communicate with a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.010 
need to be able to communicate with a
variety<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:44.000> different<00:02:44.180> people<00:02:44.630> will<00:02:44.870> be

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
variety of different people will be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.300

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
different cultures and more importantly

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.440 
different cultures and more importantly
I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.680> essential<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.000> really

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
I think it's essential that you really

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.260 
I think it's essential that you really
drive<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:51.050> own<00:02:51.290> career<00:02:51.740> forward<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.580> think<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
drive your own career forward I think a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.210 
drive your own career forward I think a
mix<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:53.930> those<00:02:54.110> attributes<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.740> essential

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
mix of all those attributes is essential

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.270 
mix of all those attributes is essential
I<00:02:56.500> guess<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.680> has<00:02:57.800> been<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.250> most

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
I guess what has been the most

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.670 
I guess what has been the most
challenging<00:02:58.730> part<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.810> program<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.440> just

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
challenging part of the program is just

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430 
challenging part of the program is just
the<00:03:00.950> fact<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.520> always<00:03:01.940> been<00:03:02.750> placed<00:03:03.080> in

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
the fact you always been placed in

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.940 
the fact you always been placed in
different<00:03:04.270> businesses<00:03:05.290> every<00:03:06.290> six<00:03:06.530> months

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
different businesses every six months

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.580 
different businesses every six months
it's<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.400> starting<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.820> new<00:03:07.970> job<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.530> you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
it's like starting a new job and you

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.290 
it's like starting a new job and you
have<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.070> be<00:03:10.190> up<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.580> running<00:03:10.640> pretty<00:03:11.150> quickly

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
have to be up and running pretty quickly

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.930 
have to be up and running pretty quickly
the<00:03:11.840> expectations<00:03:12.530> are<00:03:12.680> quite<00:03:12.770> high<00:03:13.100> often

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
the expectations are quite high often

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.460 
the expectations are quite high often
we're<00:03:14.150> put<00:03:14.420> into<00:03:14.570> situations<00:03:14.780> where<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.350> don't

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
we're put into situations where we don't

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
we're put into situations where we don't
know<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.709> lot<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.190> were<00:03:16.940> expected<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.510> perform

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
know a lot and were expected to perform

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.229 
know a lot and were expected to perform
that's<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:18.950> really<00:03:19.130> challenging<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:19.850> on

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
that's that's really challenging but on

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.240 
that's that's really challenging but on
the<00:03:20.600> flip<00:03:20.900> side<00:03:20.930> today<00:03:21.230> we're<00:03:21.709> always<00:03:21.890> being

the flip side today we're always being

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
the flip side today we're always being
pushed<00:03:22.760> out<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.060> our<00:03:23.180> comfort<00:03:23.360> zone<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.720> I

pushed out of our comfort zone and I
