it's very a couple of simple steps so
basically<00:00:26.900> your<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.910> UV<00:00:30.179> light<00:00:30.359> comes<00:00:30.660> with

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
basically your the UV light comes with

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.060 
basically your the UV light comes with
six<00:00:31.710> mine<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.550> least<00:00:32.700> came<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.180> six<00:00:34.070> light

six mine at least came with six light

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
six mine at least came with six light
bulbs<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.000> they're<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.660> packaged<00:00:37.290> very

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
bulbs and they're all here packaged very

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.540 
bulbs and they're all here packaged very
nicely<00:00:38.719> what<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> need<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:41.690> first

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
nicely what you need to do is first

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.529 
nicely what you need to do is first
install<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:45.090> light<00:00:45.480> bulbs<00:00:45.960> inside<00:00:46.440> your

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
install all your light bulbs inside your

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.069 
install all your light bulbs inside your
UV<00:00:48.539> light<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.379> turn<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.039> over<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
UV light so turn this over and as you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
UV light so turn this over and as you
can<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.559> people<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:52.980> trying<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> put

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
can see because people are trying to put

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
can see because people are trying to put
it<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> work

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it from here and it's not going to work

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
it from here and it's not going to work
it's<00:00:55.649> gonna<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.940> consuming<00:00:56.989> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's gonna be very time consuming it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
it's gonna be very time consuming it
might<00:00:58.260> work<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.469> it'll<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.579> time

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
might work but it'll take a lot of time

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
might work but it'll take a lot of time
so<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:03.260> clicks

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
so as you can see there are two clicks

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
so as you can see there are two clicks
on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.189> left<00:01:05.519> side<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.240> side<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> left

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
on the left side right side and the left

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.730 
on the left side right side and the left
side<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> gotta<00:01:08.630> push<00:01:09.630> both<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
side so you gotta push both of them in

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120 
side so you gotta push both of them in
and<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.960> bottom<00:01:13.170> part<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> machine

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and your the bottom part of the machine

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.170 
and your the bottom part of the machine
automatically<00:01:14.880> pop<00:01:15.540> open<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.970> could

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
automatically pop open so as you could

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
automatically pop open so as you could

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
see there are the spots for the light

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.760

right here and you have to remove you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.350 
right here and you have to remove you
have<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.660> peel<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.900> off<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.890> very<00:02:38.040> simple<00:02:38.760> but

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360

you have to do it just like this so this
was<00:02:43.380> one<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.340> respect<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.180> couldn't

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
was one of the respect that I couldn't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440 
was one of the respect that I couldn't
figure<00:02:46.410> out<00:02:46.560> myself<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.400> looks<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.120> all

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
figure out myself and looks like all

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.740 
figure out myself and looks like all
sides<00:02:49.020> should<00:02:49.890> have<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
sides should have it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.470 
sides should have it
if<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:52.170> then<00:02:53.390> or<00:02:54.390> maybe<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:56.580> depends<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
if not then or maybe it depends on the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.380 
if not then or maybe it depends on the
ground

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
ground

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.520 
ground
so<00:03:00.390> let<00:03:01.260> me<00:03:01.290> double<00:03:01.740> check<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:02.160> mine<00:03:03.530> looks

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
so let me double check on mine looks

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.030 
so let me double check on mine looks
like<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:07.140> looks<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.860> one

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
like this one this looks like this one

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
like this one this looks like this one
