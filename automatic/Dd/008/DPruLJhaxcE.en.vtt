00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.090
 hi to all these crises in riom 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.430
 today I'm going to talk about a easter 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.279
 egg then mr is literally translated 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.019
 in French it's an easter egg or 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.769
 simply in fact in the world of 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.359
 video game an allusion on something 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.980
 that exists in life raid in the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.690
 real life simply so that can 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.390
 to be a series it can be a book a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.330
 author anything anything a movie everything 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.809
 that you can and in diablo iii he 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.120
 there are many easter egg where there are 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.329
 always a little anecdotal note or 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 or funny so today we're going 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.890
 try to go get one so I 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.609
 wanted charged in act 2 still in 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.710
 normal mode to go faster 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.420
 so act ii gdi we will charge the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.369
 kate's last point goes the ninth 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.369
 earlier to be directly live 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:23.229
 here and then we will teleport to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.550
 the road like carnus this is not even 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.200
 shame to be because I do not make you 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.679
 anything it will be the front poster of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.099
 kazim 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:37.050
 excuse me then you will you 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:39.400
 head north now thank you 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.130
 this front post 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.450
 then we will go here we created 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.880
 blow a save point 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 that's what will interest us and so 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.570
 we will try to find a minor in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.810
 done is digging in alone 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.090
 simply and minor seals will 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.940
 explode the face with 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.780
 monsters that go to the memory floor 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.750
 I believe and this miner is always given 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.140
 a page of the big black rock book 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.759
 so you have to know it's page so 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.490
 it's not that's page 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.959
 there are 6 there is page 4 la 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.500
 paging page 15 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:22.069
 page 16 and page 23 on page 40 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.099
 and actually if six figures match 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.450
 of the series lost here so I'm going 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.639
 reload the part because I did 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.560
 no luck so this minor is getting 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.939
 found in the useless boring vent 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.099
 to go to the north it seems to me that 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.680
 can find it simply we can 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.230
 find him in that direction he can 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 also appear in the other part of 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 25 years from the south 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.629
 but as we have the save point at 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.799
 this place we will reload the part 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.260
 to find it quickly enough 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.200
 for help so here I have reloaded the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.650
 part after three about four times 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.389
 you have to fall in a big boat 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 with a thriller that is in the process of 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.230
 to simply burst how to get to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.510
 his meeting 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.669
 there is little in this ship is cursed by 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.620
 the demons I think we will stay nothing 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.719
 as long as we do not get too close 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.030
 he ended up there alone will come up 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.200
 a moment what will expose him to the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.660
 deceived 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.300
 some who will also try to you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.000
 type and then you have page 15 of the 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.920
 big book of rock thouars so here you go 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 so I tell you again there are six 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 pages 4 8 15 16 23 42 that correspond 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.430
 to the accursed six- digit series 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.040
 lost with a little a little a short 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.970
 text in fact who who is always from the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 series simply 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 and why it's called the general ledger 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.769
 black rock because that's a reference 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.170
 rightly to the boat that was 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.780
 discovered in the jungle spoken by the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.480
 survivors called the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.910
 the plastoc something like I do not know 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.410
 more really here is not everything 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.069
 just tried to load several 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.680
 time part and you will find 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.200
 so you will try to find the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.600
 six different pages it's easter eggs 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.420
 varietals and 7 easter egg only serves 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.459
 strictly for nothing at the moment it is 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.930
 the decor and it takes me room 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.760
 useless in inventory all 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.350
 just go I tell you see you soon 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.350
