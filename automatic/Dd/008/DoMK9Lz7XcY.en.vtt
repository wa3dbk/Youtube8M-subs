00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.760
 as the problem faces the problem of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.269
 fiscal overflow the government has two 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280
 ways an issue funded with the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.859
 little machine you pay what you do not have resources 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.949
 with the little machine more inflation that is a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.420
 way the other way is debt and it seems 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.350
 that is a little bit what the government 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.210
 aims placed a bonus these days 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 dollar link to the dollar list is like what 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.370
 buy that is like buying dollars at 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.410
 official 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.840
 for a fairly significant amount and 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.090
 it seems that that is another alternative in 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.460
 now if we go for that alternative you 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.020
 sucks money from the financial sector 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.870
 that money that the financial sector has 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.480
 to lend to the productive is 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.250
 diverts towards the fiscal and then 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.110
 increase interest rates and you have 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.340
 as a very strong impact on the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.830
 availability of credit for the economy 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.230
 so then that's a little bit , let's say 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.210
 of the dilemma and probably as always 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.309
 the thing is going to be a little half and half 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.290
 between those two alternatives with which 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.960
 an inflation that is going to stay in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.150
 the current or increasing values ​​and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.150
 let's say a financial sector more more 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.770
 contracted that is a problem and the other 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.720
 problem that is the one that has a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.550
 more direct relationship with the activity the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.470
 exchange destruction for how many less 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.230
 dollars if you are not willing to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.659
 put reservations you have to tighten more the 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.900
 trap between we have a dynamics of the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.060
 complicated deportations 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.800
 the government does not want to activate either 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 bet to keep the exchange rate in 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.300
 the levels more or less than you have now 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.010
 you are going to have a foreign exchange delay that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.680
 you will always have fall 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.800
 exports more stocks and drier wants 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
 say more recession because more stocks 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.730
 means that there are no inputs for the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 production and it's a vicious circle that 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.480
 they generate a direct effect on the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.390
 employment what solutions does the 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.710
 government against this I would tell you that 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 now the government is rehearsing with two 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 things the agreement with the series' the era 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.400
 know if we some dollars the law 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.410
 of carbide hydrocarbons 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.240
 extends the current concessions on 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.190
 dead cow to dealers 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.440
 current forever 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.490
 has been quite critical I think 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.290
 which is an alienation of goods 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.480
 important public already would give for another 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.909
 chat 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 and the putting here pf can attract 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.530
 from those say of that delivery 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.170
 we could say those natural resources 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.430
 some dollars next year if that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.260
 plan fails that plan would you read energy 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 you have the only resource that you have left 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.700
 is in from January to see if there 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 some kind of negotiation with the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.739
 holdouts to reopen the market a bit 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.290
 international and if you do not make the mix 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.540
 flat facial not simply to plan b is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.209
 I have no idea if it will 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.220
 implement or you will not have more stocks and 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.530
 there you will have a recessive picture 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 that the recession will continue the year that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.760
 come then you realize the absurdity of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.640
 it is a country that has no dollars and no 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.280
 allows you to export then as things are 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.859
 how are those cycles of excessive 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.540
 short-termism that good idea I want that 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.799
 the meat is cheaper of course 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.390
 we all want the meat to be more 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.099
 cheap there is no there is no one there is no 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.780
 politician or any Argentine who does not 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.640
 want but which one the solution that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.970
 the government chooses what's more 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 production not that we do not let export 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.330
 then of course initially you drop the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.130
 price 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.810
 but the five years for this ten 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.000
 millions of head of cattle and meat 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.830
 is more expensive than in the USA then we have 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.630
 that cut that ridiculous cycle that you 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.130
 generates the need for these 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.510
 restrictions that these absurdities generate 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.510
 that although you ask yourself
