00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.840
 in this video we are going to see the evolution 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.450
 of my 80-liter aquarium 69 reais 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.150
 where my dishes live and reproduce 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 coral that are all already born in this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 home 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 apart from the oral talk I have 5 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 japonic prawns 1 tÃ³th even finish 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.829
 that will soon pass to the aquarium of others and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.630
 two cookies I had before and there they go 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.180
 bothering plastic females 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.670
 In this video we will see the evolution of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.590
 aquarium using photo slides 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.420
 we will also see the fish more 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.790
 calm recorded using the zoom 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.010
 optical camera and we'll see some 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.990
 close up of it the amount of 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.900
 fry should be about 20 or more 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.300
 that you can not all see the problem 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.720
 of overpopulation has already reached my 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.720
 Aquarius 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.720
 when you have a well-planted aquarium 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.030
 and they have fish or livebearers or whether 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.220
 they keep their eggs in their uterus and the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.680
 fish is born and has the capacity to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.280
 The normal thing is that they reproduce from 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 this way 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.950
 this is the slide show forgive 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.020
 for the quality of the photos is not the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 better but so you can see better the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.229
 evolution and each photo equals one month 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.170
 ah 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.420
 ah 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.800
 The plants are the following 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.500
 tapizante is sanitary your bull is 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.330
 I also have broken the route neither folk anymore 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.130
 few you montt 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.130
 octopus and moss left 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.150
 this type of aquarium I consider it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.799
 easy maintenance and ideal for people 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.469
 that you want to start in the world of 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.469
 planted although the subscriber is daily 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.630
 Plant pruning is usually every 15 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.880
 days 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.680
 I know some of you will think that it is not so 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.780
 easy to keep an aquarium like this for 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 beginners but with a little bit of 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.510
 organization and eye you can get from 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.019
 easy way 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.340
 with 48 watts of white light 6500 degrees 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.579
 that the 25 in 69 liters and subscribed with co2 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.980
 I continued a bubble per second the 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.349
 plants grow healthy but not too 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.140
 quickly which allows me to relax with 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.150
 the pruning but without neglecting and always 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.150
 giving shape that I want to the aquarium 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.690
 every two months I can all shake it up already 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.720
 his bull is and that does take me a 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.569
 more time to have fish platies I have to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.790
 control a lot the ph with the co2 and I've 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.890
 managed to keep it in seven or seven 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.990
 with two this I have achieved 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.070
 a cache to five and not trying 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.070
 too much co2 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 I also tell you that during the first 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.459
 months you can not too much then let 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.760
 the aquarium matured and I was interested 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.770
 have the greatest possible vegetable mass for 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600
 that competed with the algae but 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.069
 always without neglecting the health of 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.879
 plants 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.310
 the filter moves 450 liters now though 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.159
 with loads and over the months 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.959
 flow is reduced you always have to have 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.359
 the filter in good condition 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.730
 there is the bacterial colony that 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.950
 will transform the noxious substance into another 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.159
 less toxic substance for our 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.159
 population 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.900
 the aquarium subscriber I established it makes 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.390
 a few months and the daily consumptions are 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.180
 the following 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.630
 15 milligrams liter of nitrate 0 with 2 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.040
 milligrams liter of phosphate and potassium 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.590
 I simply add it at a rate of 4 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.450
 milligrams liters since it did not perform 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.520
 no measurement test I tell you that 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.000
 I only measure once a month to see if 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.000
 everything is fine in the column 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.500
 of water is 5 milligrams of nitrate and 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.810
 0.3 milligrams of phosphate and / or fertilizer 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.750
 I do it with salts because I consider this 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.150
 most economical and most effective way of 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.640
 pay in our aquariums 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.770
 although made with salts we'll see 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.770
 in another chapter more extensively 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.900
 going back to talk about sipo silverfish 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.289
 by usw macula tus is a fish that 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 it needs medium soft water and lasts a 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.139
 cache not too low although this does not 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.349
 it affects you a lot and a ph from 7 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.060
 they admit a little bit of salt but sodium 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.860
 and the planted aquariums are 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.860
 practically incompatible 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.560
 It is recommended to have three females per 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.930
 each male then this pursues them in 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.550
 all day to mate and they can 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.410
 get to stress the also 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.960
 recommends a well-planted aquarium 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.280
 where fish can rest 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.280
 hide and get out of stress 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.410
 If you want to reproduce oral 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.080
 only thing to do is put some 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.090
 how many females and a male they will make 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.130
 everything by itself is also recommended 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.500
 have the ideal water conditions 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.990
 for this type of fish the only problem 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.940
 that exists with the reproduction is that 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.740
 the females and the males eat the 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.410
 newborn fry and have the 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.900
 occasion then if you have an aquarium 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.900
 planted only the strongest 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900
 they will survive 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.590
 I do not recommend putting the fish in 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.320
 parideras as that stresses a 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.300
 barbarism to animals is preferable 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.270
 have them in the aquarium and survive 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.850
 one or two fingerlings to put them in a 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.090
 and that the mother suffers from stress 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.400
 and can cause an abortion I think that 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.090
 it's better to have them in the aquarium and leave 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.440
 to nature act for itself 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.600
 only the strongest individuals 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.600
 they will survive and reproduce 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.949
 thank you very much everyone if you thought 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.949
 interesting to subscribe for more videos
