00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.589
 The challenge, of course, is the challenge 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.739
 dioxide emissions, the gas turbine is around 13 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.600
 meters you stand around the 440 450 tons 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.180
 the transport weight looks yes 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.039
 it is very voluminous too 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.479
 sensitive 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.100
 that means we want them to be mine 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.100
 So treat it very gently 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.170
 the power plant is a special one 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.640
 efficient power plant it is part of 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.870
 Energy turn as we in 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.000
 to advance dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.530
 the special thing about the power plant is to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.600
 one of the very high electrical 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.190
 efficiency then but also the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.590
 overall very high fuel 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.930
 exploitation because with this machine too 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.330
 district heating can be generated and in the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.550
 Overall, it is one of the most modern 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.630
 power plants that you look for such a 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.630
 ever imagine using it 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.930
 the three main components are 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.509
 the gas turbine of the generator and the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.190
 steam turbine and everything 3 is now 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.090
 within a relatively short time to the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.090
 arrive at the location 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 this is the power plant project 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.300
 special that we are three of course here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.729
 want to break world records 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.149
 the electrical power generated is almost 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.300
 600 megawatts of efficiency we have yes 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.120
 greater 61 percent efficiency and that 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.760
 third forum is we have 300 here 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.750
 megawatts of thermal district heating what also 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.750
 a special feature is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.380
 this is a huge project for the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.480
 Stadtwerke should also Stadtwerke 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.390
 Dusseldorf are modern company in 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.360
 a big modern growing city 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.340
 and the power station is a symbol of 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.580
 this growth for this development in 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.860
 the future 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.740
 the preparation work was perfect 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.840
 the execution was perfect and that is 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.210
 at the most at the end of the day the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.310
 a brother can watch while doing well 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.800
 that looks like it works so over 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.860
 have planned the world's highest 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.400
 efficiency in such a turbine with 61 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.710
 percent 61 percent is an efficiency 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.390
 not a few years ago 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.400
 It would have been achievable the modern 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.530
 Siemens technology makes this possible 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.530
 we build this plant 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.400
 turnkey and we will be the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.400
 Do not disappoint customers
