audience<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:07.109> working<00:00:07.379> out<00:00:07.470> today<00:00:07.649> how's

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
audience is working out today how's

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.520 
audience is working out today how's
everyone<00:00:08.340> feeling<00:00:11.719> and<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.049> stands<00:00:13.380> for

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
everyone feeling and that stands for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.200 
everyone feeling and that stands for
lactic<00:00:14.519> acid<00:00:15.150> lactic<00:00:15.960> acid<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.490> occurs<00:00:18.000> when

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
lactic acid lactic acid it occurs when

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.380 
lactic acid lactic acid it occurs when
you're<00:00:18.359> working<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.260> hard<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.390> what

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you're working out really hard and what

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.509 
you're working out really hard and what
happens<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.439> enter<00:00:22.890> into<00:00:23.130> your

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
happens is if you enter into your

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.300 
happens is if you enter into your
anaerobic<00:00:24.359> zone<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.439> no<00:00:25.590> longer<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:26.070> enough

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
anaerobic zone you no longer have enough

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609 
anaerobic zone you no longer have enough
oxygen<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> create<00:00:27.180> energy<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.260> happens

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
oxygen to create energy so what happens

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.279 
oxygen to create energy so what happens
is<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.840> energy<00:00:30.840> factories

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
is these little little energy factories

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.760 
is these little little energy factories
in<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.590> cells<00:00:31.890> mitochondria<00:00:32.690> burn

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
in your cells mitochondria burn

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.510 
in your cells mitochondria burn
carbohydrates<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.250> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
carbohydrates and when they do that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
carbohydrates and when they do that
without<00:00:35.700> oxygen<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:38.570> byproduct<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> lactic

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
without oxygen the byproduct is lactic

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
without oxygen the byproduct is lactic
acid<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.309> you're<00:00:41.489> seen<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> sponge

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
acid and as you're seen in the sponge

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
acid and as you're seen in the sponge
here<00:00:42.540> lactic<00:00:43.379> acid<00:00:43.800> builds<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> your

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
here lactic acid builds up in your

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.709 
here lactic acid builds up in your
muscles<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:47.340> why<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> burn

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
muscles so that's why you get that burn

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.479 
muscles so that's why you get that burn
when<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.289> working<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.590> hard<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.340> here's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
when you're working out hard but here's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.420 
when you're working out hard but here's
the<00:00:50.640> deal<00:00:50.760> within<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.270> hour<00:00:51.440> that<00:00:52.440> lactic<00:00:52.949> acid

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the deal within an hour that lactic acid

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
the deal within an hour that lactic acid
is<00:00:53.640> flushed<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:54.989> muscles<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.469> it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is flushed out of your muscles so it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.319 
is flushed out of your muscles so it's
not<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> lactic<00:00:56.309> acid<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> next<00:00:57.059> day<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
not the lactic acid the next day this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
not the lactic acid the next day this
making<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> sore<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.989> called<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.920> onset

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
making you sore is called the way onset

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.180 
making you sore is called the way onset
muscle<00:00:59.879> soreness<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.170> last<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.649> 1<00:01:01.980> to

muscle soreness that can last from 1 to
3<00:01:02.399> 1<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> 3<00:01:03.329> days<00:01:03.449> after<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> hard

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
3 1 to 3 days after you have a hard
workout<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:07.049> are

microscopic<00:01:10.200> level<00:01:10.700> massage<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> great<00:01:12.180> way

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
microscopic level massage is a great way

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050 
microscopic level massage is a great way
to<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.020> love<00:01:13.439> using<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.950> Styrofoam<00:01:14.220> roller

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to go I love using a Styrofoam roller

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
to go I love using a Styrofoam roller
but<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> don't<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.369> even

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but if you don't have one you can even

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
but if you don't have one you can even
use<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:18.060> balls<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.320> home<00:01:19.470> you

you<00:01:31.500> touch<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.670> but

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you touch them in a little bit but

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.749 
you touch them in a little bit but
understanding<00:01:33.540> muscles<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.259> key<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.189> weight

understanding muscles is key and weight

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.289 
understanding muscles is key and weight
loss<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.540> why<00:01:36.869> M<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.729> muscles

doing a vigorous workout you're actually

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.999 
doing a vigorous workout you're actually
tearing<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.450> getting<00:01:48.720> microscopic<00:01:49.710> tears

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
tearing you're getting microscopic tears

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.330 
tearing you're getting microscopic tears
and<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:51.060> muscle<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:52.020> happens<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.799> your

and your muscle and what happens is your

and your muscle and what happens is your
small<00:01:53.759> smaller<00:01:54.630> muscle<00:01:55.229> let's<00:01:55.680> say<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
small smaller muscle let's say this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.480 
small smaller muscle let's say this is
your<00:01:56.520> thigh<00:01:57.030> muscles<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:58.159> going<00:01:59.159> through

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
your thigh muscles here going through

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.990 
your thigh muscles here going through
that<00:01:59.610> period<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.360> repeated<00:02:01.020> tearing<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
that period of repeated tearing and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.429 
that period of repeated tearing and
recovery<00:02:03.000> provided<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:04.020> eating<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
recovery provided that you're eating the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.889 
recovery provided that you're eating the
right<00:02:04.619> stuff<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> lead<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.540> this

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
right stuff is going to lead to this
