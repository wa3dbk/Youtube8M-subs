00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.719
 stuffed chicken if you want to cheer with 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.549

 salt and freshly ground black pepper and 200 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 milliliters of whole milk the first thing is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 attack the chicken we open in a single 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.700
 fillet as if it were a booklet what 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.010
 aderezamos with salt and pepper to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 taste we cover the filet with a slice 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.440
 of cooked ham and in the same way with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 the cheese slice in the middle of what 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.940
 that is the steak we add the taquitos 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.699
 of ham we closed the steak part 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.460
 lower than the upper one has to be 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.500
 the part of the cut where the filling is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.750
 always looking down because what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.379
 we want the oven to be the top 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.299
 we're going to help you either 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.299
 of a special twine cord for 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.640
 the kitchen I recommend a mesh of 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.829
 which is usually done to make chicken 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.229
 filling as in this case we preheat 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.630
 the oven at 160 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.979
 We did with a little oil before 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.640
 to put in the oven in the next 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.409
 we order at 150 degrees for 25 to 30 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.090
 minutes while we dream we are going to 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.880
 prepare our sauce in a saucepan 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.819
 we put our onion and a 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.159
 Once we have it already soft, we add 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.740
 a little mustard we toasted 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.959
 high temperature and pour the milk 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.670
 whole stir well until it starts 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.560
 to thicken always at low temperature 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.840
 we pepper to taste and let 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.429
 reduce the liquid removed from the oven and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.250
 We cut with a saw knife 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.630
 our breasts I like to put them 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 in medallions to make it look 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.580
 perfectly filling and being able to notice 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.530
 or cover them with the sauce 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.220
