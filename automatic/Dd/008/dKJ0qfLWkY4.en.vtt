00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 about five months from the beginning of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 world how much responsibility is felt 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.330
 in representing Italy at the level 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.700
 arbitration is undoubtedly heard 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.900
 feel I was the happiest person in the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.340
 world when they have it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.379
 communique 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 and a few moments later I realized 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.330
 that in any case I am going to represent a 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.359
 35,000 referee movement then the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.830
 you feel I want to specify 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 I believe it is important to emphasize 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 that how I went there and I was 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 chosen I could very well be chosen 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.350
 rock in first person of Italy has 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.600
 fortunately right now i 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.190
 very important representatives and not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 I'm certainly the only one who knows he had them 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.590
 potential to go global 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 unfortunately for choices that depend on 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 fright 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 you can choose you can only bring one 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 referee for nation us in this case 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.450
 we were i was chosen in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.860
 this case then 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.780
 I just wanted to emphasize the fact that 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.370
 I'm not the only one able to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.900
 go global in Italy but 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 fortunately we have a nice group 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.770
 in a few seasons we could see a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 referee in this situation before 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.550
 microphones and cameras even after one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
 game as soon as advised I hope so 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.090
 but honestly it also depends on you or 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.460
 better 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 pass me the term you in a broad sense 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 unfortunately the Italian culture does today 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 struggling to see or tolerate accepting 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 the referee who comments on his own mistake 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 or something wrong with a game 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.490
 it would be nice to do it takes a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 hand from everyone to do it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:46.800
 and you surely are the first you can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 help us and look 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.940
 honestly I have had several 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.670
 designers unfortunately in the sense that they are 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.290
 already quite old and every 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 designer really gave a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 important contribution to my career 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 personal but I believe that of a 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 group 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.760
 who gave it the most from a bit of sight 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.410
 technician more from a point of view 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.220
 behavioral enthusiasm 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.260
 etc. etc. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.110
 stefano managed to pass on one 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.660
 serenity to the really important group 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 and I believe that you see in the field I believe 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.930
 that we really see we have gods 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.520
 really good managers technicians 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 really good 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840
 not only did Stefano do a great job 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 work but also Spaniards with 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.410
 assistants I think it was both below 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.970
 the eyes of all the work of 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.470
 assistants who believe that at the level 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.180
 worldwide we are the best ever 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 of our so I expect the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 neighbor who arrives at them 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 contributions that Braschi was able to give 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 be of serenity and can bring something 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.320
 even after a technical view we have 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:53.190
 excellent communication skills 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.140
 we are in 2014 and communicate like the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.709
 arrow that was given by his 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.970
 important colleague know how to teach cars 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.900
 technically because we have gods 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.030
 Young people 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.470
 that they are appearing that they have 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.959
 great potential however not 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.739
 need important lessons 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.190
 therefore also from a technical point of view 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.690
 mostly 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 in light of the new offside and of 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.180
 certain regulatory entries that 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.300
 important a technician who follows in the footsteps 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.620
 of the uefa and of the fifa therefore that has 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.790
 features also at levels 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.620
 important international organizations 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.830
 the most important gift to cheer on Juventus 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.730
 in serenity that I believe that juventus inter 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.740
 both may be as important as a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 catania livorno for the championship 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.960
 Italian is clear that a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 a return of image that Livorno does not 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.890
 can have and therefore it takes the same 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.290
 the same grit ability 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.700
 dedication with so much serenity because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.230
 the one with the lowest experience 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.140
 the Italians are still international 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.670
 those more disciplined discipline i 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.010
 every swine the players believe in 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.959
 time when the same players are 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.870
 in an international context I am very 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.709
 disciplined therefore Italy will know how to make itself 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.709
 apply also at international level
