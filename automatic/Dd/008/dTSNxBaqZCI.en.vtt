00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 so to see your mac address to us 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 need to go to the network control center and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:27.090
 this can be done either through the panel 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 control here you need to go to the section 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.730
 I have my own connection, but here is one 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.649
