okay<00:00:02.280> guys<00:00:02.490> then<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.990> just<00:00:04.380> took<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> thing<00:00:04.890> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay guys then I just took the thing and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.780 
okay guys then I just took the thing and
I<00:00:06.060> thought<00:00:06.299> I'd<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.930> little<00:00:07.290> video<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.130> just

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
I thought I'd do a little video and just

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.049 
I thought I'd do a little video and just
showing<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.240> built<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.630> incubator<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
showing how I built my incubator and

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.640 
showing how I built my incubator and
I've<00:00:12.059> had<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.420> quite<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.870> while<00:00:13.110> now<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I've had it for quite a while now and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.590 
I've had it for quite a while now and
it's<00:00:14.130> proven<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.299> way<00:00:16.049> better<00:00:16.350> than<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
it's proven to be way better than the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
it's proven to be way better than the
Exo<00:00:18.600> Terra<00:00:18.710> incubators<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:21.890> just<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.340> know

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
Exo Terra incubators and just you know

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
Exo Terra incubators and just you know
any<00:00:23.640> inky<00:00:24.000> weight<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.420> buy<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.810> mean<00:00:24.990> this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
any inky weight you can buy I mean this

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
any inky weight you can buy I mean this
one<00:00:25.789> must've<00:00:26.789> cost<00:00:26.939> me<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:28.189> mean<00:00:29.189> most<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
one must've cost me about I mean most of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
one must've cost me about I mean most of
the<00:00:29.760> stuff<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.119> already<00:00:30.359> had<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> think

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the stuff I already had but I think

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.280 
the stuff I already had but I think
really<00:00:31.949> would<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.550> been<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:33.149> 40<00:00:33.840> pounds

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
really would have been about 40 pounds

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.729 
really would have been about 40 pounds
something<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.140> I<00:00:37.140> mean<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> only

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
something like that and I mean the only

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.790 
something like that and I mean the only
thing<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> bought<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> heatmap

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
thing I bought really was the heatmap

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
thing I bought really was the heatmap
that's<00:00:41.190> inside<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.500> I've

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that's inside it and now because I've

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.680 
that's inside it and now because I've
got<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.360> trade<00:00:45.360> account<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.930> certain<00:00:46.500> shops<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
got a trade account with certain shops I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.029 
got a trade account with certain shops I
don't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> pay<00:00:49.110> full<00:00:49.350> price<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.860> them

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
don't have to pay full price for them

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810 
don't have to pay full price for them
anyway<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.379> yes<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.399> would<00:00:53.730> have

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
anyway and so I think yes but would have

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.330 
anyway and so I think yes but would have
been<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.120> 40<00:00:54.600> 45<00:00:55.260> pounds<00:00:55.949> something<00:00:56.219> either

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
been about 40 45 pounds something either

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.670 
been about 40 45 pounds something either
to<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.570> build<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> from<00:00:58.109> scratch<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to actually build it from scratch and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.029 
to actually build it from scratch and
buy<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> things<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.739> got

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
shelves but what I've got in it is a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.789 
shelves but what I've got in it is a
heat<00:01:34.049> map<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.650> runs<00:01:34.920> from<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:36.680> right<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
heat map the runs from here right the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.390 
heat map the runs from here right the
way<00:01:37.920> down<00:01:38.000> down<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> back<00:01:39.950> right<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
way down down the back right down and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
way down down the back right down and
underneath<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.630> tray<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.890> stops<00:01:44.130> here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
underneath this tray and it stops here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.929 
underneath this tray and it stops here
in<00:01:44.700> line<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> top<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.159> then<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
in line with the top one and then the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.600 
in line with the top one and then the
heat<00:01:48.210> mop<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.850> if<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.990> wire<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
heat mop and if I can see the wire the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.539 
heat mop and if I can see the wire the
wire<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.939> drilled<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.420> hole<00:01:54.450> behind<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
wire I drilled a hole behind it and the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.859 
wire I drilled a hole behind it and the
way<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.700> took<00:01:57.060> through<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> goes<00:01:57.719> out

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
way I took through that and goes out

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.100 
way I took through that and goes out
there<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.210> I'm<00:02:00.210> gonna<00:02:00.390> put<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> plug<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
there and I'm gonna put the plug on it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
there and I'm gonna put the plug on it
obviously<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.549> drilled<00:02:02.790> another

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
obviously and then I drilled another

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.050 
obviously and then I drilled another
hole<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.780> far<00:02:04.110> corner<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> put<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
hole in this far corner here and put the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.380 
hole in this far corner here and put the
probe<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> thermistor<00:02:07.649> fruit<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:09.270> then

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
probe for the thermistor fruit and then

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
probe for the thermistor fruit and then
that<00:02:09.509> proves<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> was<00:02:10.649> stuck

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that proves just there it was stuck

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.800 
that proves just there it was stuck
there<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:11.910> fallen<00:02:12.150> off

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
there but it's fallen off

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.220 
there but it's fallen off
Propst<00:02:13.260> there<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.930> I've<00:02:16.050> done

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
Propst there and then what I've done

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.740 
Propst there and then what I've done
down<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:18.050> can<00:02:19.050> even<00:02:19.170> open<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:21.030> tray

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
down here I can even open is the tray

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.510 
down here I can even open is the tray
that<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.230> usually<00:02:22.380> keep<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.890> vegetables

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that you usually keep like vegetables

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.410 
that you usually keep like vegetables
and<00:02:23.730> things<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:26.069> filled<00:02:26.580> it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and things like that in and I filled it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.790 
and things like that in and I filled it
was<00:02:27.569> full<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.110> obviously<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.560> has<00:02:28.680> been

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
was full but obviously this has been

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.160 
was full but obviously this has been
running<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.280> couple<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.519> months<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
running for a couple of months now and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890 
running for a couple of months now and
fill<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.349> with<00:02:31.470> water<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.420> normal<00:02:33.420> cold<00:02:33.660> war

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
fill it with water just normal cold war

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.509 
fill it with water just normal cold war
didn't<00:02:34.319> even<00:02:34.410> bother<00:02:34.590> boiling<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.220> anything

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
didn't even bother boiling or anything

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.150 
didn't even bother boiling or anything
and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:37.370> made<00:02:38.370> use<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.970> shelves<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and then made use of all the shelves and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.699 
and then made use of all the shelves and
made<00:02:41.160> sure<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.610> can<00:02:41.760> fit<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.030> many<00:02:42.500> tubs<00:02:43.500> in

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
made sure that I can fit as many tubs in

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.910 
made sure that I can fit as many tubs in
it<00:02:43.830> as<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.640> or<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> need<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.080> mean<00:02:46.680> even

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it as a one and or as a need I mean even

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.500 
it as a one and or as a need I mean even
if<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.130> wanted<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> fit<00:02:47.610> more<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.970> all<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.209> have<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
if I wanted to fit more in all I have to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180 
if I wanted to fit more in all I have to
do<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.690> take<00:02:48.900> these<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.319> shelter<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.860> stack

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
do is take these to shelter and stack

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.780 
do is take these to shelter and stack
all<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> tubs<00:02:50.700> off<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.400> yeah

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
all the tubs off and so yeah

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.809 
all the tubs off and so yeah
at<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.030> moment<00:02:54.180> I've<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:55.310> about<00:02:56.310> nine<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:56.790> ten

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
at the moment I've got about nine or ten

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.390 
at the moment I've got about nine or ten
tubs<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.690> as<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.920> see<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.250> not

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
tubs in it and as you can see it's not

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.710 
tubs in it and as you can see it's not
even<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.670> full<00:02:59.880> yet<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
even a full yet and and then the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.210 
even a full yet and and then the
obviously<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.780> heat<00:03:07.470> mark<00:03:07.709> goes<00:03:07.860> into<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
obviously the heat mark goes into the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.500 
obviously the heat mark goes into the
thermostat<00:03:08.760> I've<00:03:09.660> got<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.019> set<00:03:10.470> at<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
thermostat I've got this set at just a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.319 
thermostat I've got this set at just a
bow<00:03:13.049> it's<00:03:13.920> about<00:03:14.040> 78<00:03:14.670> 79<00:03:15.319> M<00:03:16.319> or<00:03:17.220> 26<00:03:17.970> degrees

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
bow it's about 78 79 M or 26 degrees

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.110 
bow it's about 78 79 M or 26 degrees
Celsius<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:22.430> these<00:03:23.430> lid<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:23.850> work

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
Celsius and and these lid you can work

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.960 
Celsius and and these lid you can work
with<00:03:24.560> factories<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.269> seems<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.410> be

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
with factories and but this seems to be

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.090 
with factories and but this seems to be
having<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.690> I've<00:03:31.470> been<00:03:31.769> able<00:03:31.890> to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
having it like this I've been able to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.460 
having it like this I've been able to
actually<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> actual<00:03:35.970> day<00:03:36.470> tell

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
actually like to the actual day tell

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.559 
actually like to the actual day tell
when<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.100> eggs<00:03:38.220> are<00:03:38.280> going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.489> hatch<00:03:38.569> because

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
when the eggs are going to hatch because

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.940 
when the eggs are going to hatch because
the<00:03:40.200> heat<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.650> always<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:42.950> just

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
the heat is always on and this just

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.470 
the heat is always on and this just
works<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.459> much<00:03:44.609> better<00:03:44.670> than<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> ones<00:03:45.299> that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
works so much better than the ones that

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.809 
works so much better than the ones that
you<00:03:45.569> can<00:03:45.690> buy<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.430> obviously<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.730> lot

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
you can buy and obviously it's a lot

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.270 
you can buy and obviously it's a lot
cheap<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.299> might<00:03:48.450> take<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> bit<00:03:48.900> more<00:03:49.049> room<00:03:49.440> it

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
cheap it might take a bit more room it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.240 
cheap it might take a bit more room it
would<00:03:50.489> depend<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.910> how<00:03:51.060> many<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:52.069> how<00:03:53.069> many

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
would depend on how many like how many

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.080 
would depend on how many like how many
eggs<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.639> are<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.269> put<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.739> but<00:03:55.739> I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
eggs you are going to put in it but I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.340 
eggs you are going to put in it but I
mean<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.690> tell<00:03:57.900> when<00:03:58.109> they're<00:03:58.260> going

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
mean if you can tell when they're going

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.050 
mean if you can tell when they're going
to<00:03:58.410> hatch<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.859> means<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.400> obviously<00:03:59.670> make

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
to hatch it means you can obviously make

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.780 
to hatch it means you can obviously make
self<00:04:00.870> available<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.680> day<00:04:01.950> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
self available for that day and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.520 
self available for that day and
everything<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.660> basically<00:04:04.079> any

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
everything like that so basically any

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.550 
everything like that so basically any
egg<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.950> put<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.930> except<00:04:06.930> pythons<00:04:07.410> because

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
egg I put in here except pythons because

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.129 
egg I put in here except pythons because
I've<00:04:07.829> never<00:04:07.980> actually<00:04:08.100> done<00:04:08.489> them<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.139> anyway

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
I've never actually done them and anyway

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.309 
I've never actually done them and anyway
I<00:04:10.170> put<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.620> here<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.150> guess<00:04:12.420> it's<00:04:13.049> going

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
I put in here and I can guess it's going

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.300 
I put in here and I can guess it's going
to<00:04:13.380> look<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:14.389> exactly<00:04:15.389> 60<00:04:15.810> days<00:04:16.039> so<00:04:17.039> for

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
to look at exactly 60 days so for

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.390 
to look at exactly 60 days so for
example<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:19.709> going<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.010> put<00:04:20.130> an<00:04:20.250> egg<00:04:20.370> in

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
example and I'm going to put an egg in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.620 
example and I'm going to put an egg in
on<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.000> first<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:23.150> first<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.390> November

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
on the first of a first of November

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.130 
on the first of a first of November
and<00:04:26.170> then<00:04:26.610> it's<00:04:27.610> going<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.880> hatch<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.930> 1st

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and then it's going to hatch on the 1st

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.940 
and then it's going to hatch on the 1st
of<00:04:29.320> January

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
of January

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.410 
of January
give<00:04:30.430> or<00:04:30.550> take<00:04:30.580> couple<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.120> days<00:04:31.270> because

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
give or take couple of days because

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.310 
give or take couple of days because
obviously<00:04:31.690> as<00:04:33.180> some<00:04:34.180> months<00:04:34.450> have<00:04:34.600> 32<00:04:35.170> days

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
obviously as some months have 32 days
