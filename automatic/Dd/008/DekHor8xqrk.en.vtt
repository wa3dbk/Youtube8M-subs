00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
map on on a Google map and then it will

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.690 
map on on a Google map and then it will

automatic photos have been taken and
there<00:01:21.130> will<00:01:21.219> be<00:01:21.310> typically<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.939> lot<00:01:22.210> more<00:01:22.420> along

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
there will be typically a lot more along

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.270 
there will be typically a lot more along
the<00:01:22.869> way<00:01:22.990> but<00:01:23.049> we<00:01:23.289> just<00:01:23.439> took<00:01:23.619> out<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.799> few<00:01:24.039> so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
the way but we just took out a few so

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.529 
the way but we just took out a few so
that<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.549> made<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.789> map<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:24.999> little<00:01:25.299> bit<00:01:25.390> more

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
that it made the map a little bit more

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.630 
that it made the map a little bit more
clean<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.109> then<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.770> video<00:01:27.039> symbol<00:01:27.490> will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
clean and then the video symbol will

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.730 
clean and then the video symbol will
show<00:01:27.850> where<00:01:28.090> your<00:01:28.240> videos<00:01:28.689> were<00:01:28.929> recorded<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
the m's will be where the manual photos

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.749 
the m's will be where the manual photos
were<00:01:32.530> taken<00:01:32.679> where<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.070> may<00:01:33.189> be<00:01:33.249> stopped<00:01:33.549> and
