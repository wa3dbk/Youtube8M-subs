00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.140
 Thor's ideal point should be 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.029
 defined taking into account the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.910
 customer preference 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.489
 but it should not be forgotten that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.650
 clearer provides a drink with 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.800
 most characteristic aroma and flavor 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.940
 while making it darker makes the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 coffee more bitter when it reaches the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.530
 toaster roaster should be 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.790
 off and the coffee is dumped in the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.920
 cold 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.840
 this is another device that should be 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.850
 installed near the donor 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.399
 on the opposite side of the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.160
 supply 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.649
 see that in the chiller roasted coffee is 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.079
 constantly reversed allowing the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.460
 their contact with the air and thus 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.559
 its temperature 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.960
 although there are systems of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.300
 cooling systems that allow the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.660
 the coffee temperature in a shorter time 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.240
 systems should be preferred 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.190
 because they do not interfere with the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.039
 final product 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.259
 the capacity of policyholders should be 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.660
 compatible with the expectation of production 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.539
 of the roaster and with the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.709
 daily work 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.080
 there are market towers of 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.450
 different capacities ranging from 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.420
 a few pounds an hour to more than 3 thousand 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.880
 kilos per hour the residents and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.069
 units of heat that will be purchased 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.050
 shall present the operation and 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.959
 Ecologically correct 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.149
 manufacturers of such equipment 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.360
 provide guarantees that such 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.270
 machines in operation presented 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.800
 minimal pollution of the environment 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 appropriately appropriate with the limits 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.959
 established by environmental laws 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.780
 In addition, 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.569
 information about the care and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
 maintenance to be carried out in these 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.720
 machines so that they can 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.720
 operate correctly
