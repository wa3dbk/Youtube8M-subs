that's not a better team on paper but if
that<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> case<00:00:09.059> then<00:00:09.240> man<00:00:09.840> city<00:00:10.080> will<00:00:10.290> be

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
that was the case then man city will be

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
going to take it for granted Wigan have

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.860 
going to take it for granted Wigan have
proven<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.670> take<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> scalp<00:00:15.660> and

proven that they can take a scalp and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.290 
proven that they can take a scalp and
they'll<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.119> ISIL<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.210> not

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
they'll be up for it so ISIL are not

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.250 
they'll be up for it so ISIL are not
going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.900> granted<00:00:18.930> because

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
going to take them for granted because

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.710 
going to take them for granted because
if<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> big<00:00:21.000> mistake<00:00:21.119> so

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
if they do it will be a big mistake so

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.759 
if they do it will be a big mistake so
you<00:00:22.020> know<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.320> they'll<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.650> very

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you know I think they'll be very

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.080 
you know I think they'll be very
professional<00:00:23.550> because<00:00:23.699> they're<00:00:23.850> gonna<00:00:23.939> have

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
professional because they're gonna have

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.750 
professional because they're gonna have
to<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.330> because<00:00:24.470> Wigan<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.189> chance<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to be because Wigan have got a chance to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
to be because Wigan have got a chance to
maybe<00:00:27.180> retain<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> cup<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> get

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
maybe retain the cup if they can get

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.009 
maybe retain the cup if they can get
there<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.760> Arsenal<00:00:30.269> then

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
there and if they can be Arsenal then

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.150 
there and if they can be Arsenal then
they'll<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> good<00:00:31.529> chance<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> doing<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
they'll have a good chance of doing it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
they'll have a good chance of doing it
they<00:00:32.250> might<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.610> hollow<00:00:32.880> shell<00:00:33.210> forgive<00:00:33.510> me

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
they might have hollow shell forgive me

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
they might have hollow shell forgive me
in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> final<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> massive

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in the final so this is a massive

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
in the final so this is a massive
massive<00:00:36.780> carrot<00:00:37.770> fort<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.550> Wigan<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.510> well

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
massive carrot fort for Wigan to do well

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
massive carrot fort for Wigan to do well
as<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:40.079> it'd<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> massive<00:00:40.829> massive

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

especially when you lose a couple of
players<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.739> integral<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.399> you're

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
players that are integral to what you're

players that are integral to what you're
trying<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.350> when<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> look<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
trying to do but when you look at the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
trying to do but when you look at the
city<00:01:02.039> squad<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> even<00:01:03.210> Chelsea's<00:01:03.629> experience

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
city squad and even Chelsea's experience

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
city squad and even Chelsea's experience
in<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.010> Liverpool<00:01:05.489> emerging

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
in this one the way Liverpool emerging

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.740 
in this one the way Liverpool emerging
you<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:08.060> what<00:01:09.060> Arsenal<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.510> tried

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you have to see what Arsenal are tried

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.640 
you have to see what Arsenal are tried
to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.200> they've<00:01:10.320> done<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to do and what they've done to this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
to do and what they've done to this
point<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> great<00:01:11.340> effort<00:01:11.600> still<00:01:12.600> believe

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
point is a great effort still believe

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
point is a great effort still believe
that<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.080> finish<00:01:13.380> full<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that if they finish full and they can

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
that if they finish full and they can
win<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> FA<00:01:16.500> Cup<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.280> no<00:01:17.640> foregone

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
win the FA Cup which is not no foregone

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
win the FA Cup which is not no foregone
conclusion<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.810> under<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> pressure

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
conclusion there under a lot of pressure

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
conclusion there under a lot of pressure
to<00:01:19.710> win<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.610> save<00:01:20.820> face<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.900> that's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to win that just a save face so that's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.289 
to win that just a save face so that's
pressure<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> itself<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> think

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
pressure in itself so you know I think

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.490 
pressure in itself so you know I think
they've<00:01:24.390> done<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:24.930> point<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.350> if

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
they've done well up to this point so if

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
they've done well up to this point so if
they<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.830> finish<00:01:26.009> full<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> FA<00:01:27.659> Cup

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
they can finish full and when the FA Cup

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
they can finish full and when the FA Cup
you<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> say<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.740> successful

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you have to say that's a successful

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
you have to say that's a successful
season<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.290> previously<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.470> they've

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
season because previously they they've

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
season because previously they they've
only<00:01:32.220> finished<00:01:32.549> full

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240 

I<00:01:35.600> think<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:36.900> unfair<00:01:37.290> unfair<00:01:38.070> on

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I think that's pretty unfair unfair on

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
I think that's pretty unfair unfair on
earth<00:01:38.490> especially<00:01:38.850> he's<00:01:39.330> come<00:01:39.510> over<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.840> his

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
earth especially he's come over in his

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
earth especially he's come over in his
first<00:01:40.200> season<00:01:40.410> with<00:01:40.620> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.010> of<00:01:41.040> pressure<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
first season with a lot of pressure you
