00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
propeller at the end there we go

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:14.300 
propeller at the end there we go
and<00:02:02.780> next<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.860> spinning<00:02:05.580> rotor<00:02:06.330> weapon

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.550 

after<00:02:15.310> connecting<00:02:15.609> all<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.719> we<00:02:17.349> can

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
after connecting all of that and we can

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.240 
after connecting all of that and we can
add<00:02:17.799> on<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.519> sword<00:02:19.180> blades<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.099> they

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
add on the sword blades so that they

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.880 
add on the sword blades so that they
look<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.609> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
look like this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.369 
look like this
next<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.159> put<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.549> all<00:02:24.670> together<00:02:24.849> just

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
next you can put it all together just

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.209 
next you can put it all together just
attach<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.680> tail<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.219> end<00:02:28.829> fold<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:30.069> up

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
attach the tail at the end fold it up

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.190 
attach the tail at the end fold it up
like<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:33.329> and<00:02:34.329> then<00:02:34.450> give<00:02:34.719> them<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:34.989> little

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.759 
like that and then give them this little
weapon<00:02:35.560> thingy<00:02:36.840> after<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.379> are<00:02:38.409> done

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
weapon thingy after that you are done

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.470 
weapon thingy after that you are done
well<00:02:41.769> done<00:02:46.439> to<00:02:47.439> get<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.799> thing<00:02:48.099> started

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
well done to get this thing started

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
well done to get this thing started
first<00:02:49.480> you're<00:02:49.689> going<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> need<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.049> sword<00:02:51.040> away

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
first you're going to need a sword away

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.500 
first you're going to need a sword away
the<00:02:52.090> arms<00:02:52.510> up<00:02:52.859> these<00:02:54.209> shoulder<00:02:55.209> spines<00:02:55.629> out

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the arms up these shoulder spines out

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.740 
the arms up these shoulder spines out
and<00:02:58.510> flip<00:02:58.840> these<00:02:59.079> things<00:02:59.409> around<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.450> tail

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
and flip these things around the tail

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.009 
and flip these things around the tail
around<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.560> out<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:06.060> flip<00:03:07.060> these<00:03:07.269> armor<00:03:07.780> bits

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019

and<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.889> head<00:03:09.099> around<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.819> it<00:03:09.909> forms<00:03:10.269> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and the head around so it forms the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.689 
and the head around so it forms the
front<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.469> copter<00:03:14.010> after<00:03:15.010> putting<00:03:15.549> the

front of the copter after putting the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.240 
front of the copter after putting the
arms<00:03:16.060> straight<00:03:16.479> up<00:03:16.510> flip<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.650> whole<00:03:17.799> thing<00:03:18.069> on

arms straight up flip the whole thing on

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.449 
arms straight up flip the whole thing on
its<00:03:18.459> stomach<00:03:18.729> and<00:03:21.659> flip<00:03:22.659> the<00:03:22.840> legs<00:03:23.079> around<00:03:23.459> so

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
its stomach and flip the legs around so

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.250 
its stomach and flip the legs around so
that<00:03:24.489> they<00:03:25.239> look<00:03:25.750> like<00:03:26.189> this
