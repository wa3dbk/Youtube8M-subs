00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.580 
couple here but I might change them out
but<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> hollowed<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.100> tips<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
but I hollowed the tips out here and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.400 
but I hollowed the tips out here and
made<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.970> some<00:02:31.209> little<00:02:31.360> flower<00:02:31.660> pots<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
made just some little flower pots so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
made just some little flower pots so
they're<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.670> similar<00:02:34.120> but<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> little

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
they're a little similar but a little

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.330 
they're a little similar but a little
different<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.990> one's<00:02:35.230> got<00:02:35.440> two<00:02:35.650> Cascades

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
different this one's got two Cascades

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.400 
different this one's got two Cascades
and<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.520> just<00:02:39.700> runs<00:02:39.940> down<00:02:40.209> into<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
and then it just runs down into the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.220 
and then it just runs down into the
reservoir<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.580> just<00:02:42.850> like<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.959> small

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
reservoir here just like just a small

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.790 
reservoir here just like just a small
little<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.709> three<00:02:45.040> foot<00:02:45.340> run<00:02:49.590> works<00:02:50.590> out

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
little like three foot run works out

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.530 
little like three foot run works out
pretty<00:02:51.040> nice<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.610> nighttime<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.330> lit

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
pretty nice that nighttime it's all lit

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.670 
pretty nice that nighttime it's all lit
up<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:54.430> it
