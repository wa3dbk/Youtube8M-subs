both the same design but the way the
wheels<00:01:21.840> manufactured<00:01:22.619> allows<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
wheels manufactured allows you the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
wheels manufactured allows you the
flexibility<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> masking<00:01:24.869> certain<00:01:25.200> areas<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
flexibility of masking certain areas of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
flexibility of masking certain areas of
the<00:01:25.710> spokes<00:01:26.009> allowing<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> different<00:01:27.210> design

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the spokes allowing a different design

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
the spokes allowing a different design
just<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> paint<00:01:28.320> concept<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.369> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
just with a paint concept so actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219 
just with a paint concept so actually
it's<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:30.060> wheel<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it's the same wheel but just kind of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
it's the same wheel but just kind of
reversed<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.369> every<00:01:32.700> wheel<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.420> its

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
reversed it so every wheel can have its

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.370 
reversed it so every wheel can have its
own<00:01:33.659> personality

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
own personality

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.789
