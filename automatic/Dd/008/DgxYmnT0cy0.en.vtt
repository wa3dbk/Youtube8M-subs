00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:23.230

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.030
 arrange to make our necklace with a 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.480
 communism disk we have connected eight 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.020
 strips of a meter fifty we're going to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.830
 place it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 The first two strips are placed in 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:56.239
 the point that are 32 and 1 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.350
 the two ladies with the placed in the 17 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.350
 and in the 16th 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.590
 the next two we put them in the 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:18.479
 23 and in 24 and those that remain 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.479
 in 9 and in 8 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.980
 we put it in focus and we're going to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.980
 start making the bracelet 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.690
 we started 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.530
 with the one towards 15 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.790
 and 16 to 31 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.860
 Once this is done we turn in the direction 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.050
 clockwise and we do what 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.750
 same from 25 to 7 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.659
 and from 9 to 23 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:00.640
 and we shot again 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.640
 from 15 to 30 from 32 to 14 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.950
 we come back 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.700
 from 8 to 22 and from 23 to 6 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.700
 and we go on 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.240
 with care that the agreement does not come out 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.560
 and we continue to make a cord that 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.560
 be long for our neck 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.439
 once we finished our cord in the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.989
 disc as we said what we do is with 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:55.420
 two butts girls 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.420
 we leave the loose ends and burn them 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.450
 to stick it is a silver detail 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.720
 we burn the other end 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.010
 and with the black cord we do the same 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.290
 we have done the black cord just like 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.290
 the target 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.120
 the same procedure 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.159
 join the two cords and go linking the 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.550
 to make our necklace 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.520
 with adequate separation 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.580
 we already have the necklace in fact what 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.280
 let's do 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.280
 and explain the silver details 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.099
 to each point 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.770
 and once pasted we put a carabiner 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.770
 here and we have done 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.150
 our necklace with a table with minimum 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.150
 I hope you like it
