00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 the course will be class 13 pass filter 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.370
 casualties 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:17.310
 the low pass filter is essentially 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:23.760
 a rc6 circuit only that now 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 Attention is output obtained upon 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 capacitor analysis is very similar to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 already made in the high pass filter 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:45.930
 there is an expression that gives the module of the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:49.410
 gain this is the relationship between vs and see is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.270
 given by this square root / expression 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.270
 one more f / fc squared 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.510
 note that in the high pass filter it was fc 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.170
 / eff 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.820
 therefore attention or in decibels is 20 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.299
 times the keeper of this relationship 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 we also have an expression that gives the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.770
 gain phase 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.250
 this is the attention deficit of leaving 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 entrance attention 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 depends on the frequency of the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.740
 input 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 for example if the frequency of the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 input was equal to the cutoff frequency 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.470
 then in this case the lag is 45 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.470
 degrees 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.899
 the gain graph 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 let's analyze the gain behavior 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.579
 depending on the frequency 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 for example if the input signal has 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.079
 frequency zero or tends to zero then 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.750
 the f / sc ratio will tend to zero 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.340
 therefore the gain tends to 1 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 in other words if the input is a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 continued attention when the pastor 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.780
 charges the output voltage will be equal 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.119
 the attention of entrance 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.039
 that is, the pastor carries the value 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.039
 of the input voltage so it gains is a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.299
 if on the other hand the signal frequency 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.629
 input is much greater than the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.980
 cutting frequency that is going to 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.299
 capacitor recharge decreases greatly and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.019
 consequently the output voltage 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.670
 decreases and therefore the gain decreases 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.239
 exactly when the signal frequency 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.959
 was ten times the frequency of cuts 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:44.609
 substitution in the expression will result in 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:50.099
 gain of approximately 0.1 or less 20 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:54.959
 and babies if f were fc times again 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.730
 a gain of 0.01 or less will result. 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.290
 40 babies 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.470
 on the other hand if the signal frequency 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.400
 was exactly equal to 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.359
 frequency and do not forget that the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.109
 cutoff frequency it is calculated 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:22.470
 exactly as in the other pass filter 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:26.160
 that is 1 / isp times r times and then 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.169
 if f was equal to fc what happens 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:36.120
 the gain will be 07 07 or less three 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:38.069
 babies at last if f 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.639
 It was very very loud they are attending 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.069
 to infinity obviously that this 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.680
 number tends to infinity so 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.209
 this number tends to zero is the gain 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.030
 tends to zero 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.750
 in other words a very frequent frequency 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.120
 the pastor will behave as a 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.230
 short circuit and therefore attention in 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.590
 output will be 0 by placing on the graph 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.069
 these conditions 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.139
 we represent in relation graph vsv nodes 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.109
 we will have a graph where for the 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:17.239
 frequency close to zero 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:20.700
 the gain is approximately 1 or is a 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.370
 we are on the threshold as the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.440
 frequency increases in the frequency of 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.610
 cut what happens to gain 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.090
 the gain drops to 0707 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.980
 if we increase further the frequency 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.510
 for a frequency of 10 times the 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.440
 cutting frequency 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.720
 the gain will be 0 1 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.810
 if they were times it would be 0 01 and so on 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.810
 against 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.220
 representing this in decibels 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.670
 we have here the graph that shows the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.720
 gain in decibels due to the 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.380
 frequency 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.500
 so if the frequency is close to zero 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.070
 far below the cutoff frequency 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:16.080
 the gain is approximately 1 in the graph 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:20.520
 from the top or 0 babies on the bottom 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.570
 cutoff frequency when f was the fc 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.100
 gain falls to three babies do not forget have 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.110
 to do with hearing 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.040
 any variation of sound a minor and three 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.650
 babies 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.980
 the human being can not distinguish 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.100
 only when the assessment is greater than 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.010
 three babies 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.390
 if the frequency is ten times fc that 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.470
 happens with gain is approximately 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.720
 least 20 beers for one frequency 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.560
 100 times the cut-off frequency gain 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:00.419
 will be worth 4 - 40 babies 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.180
 then this is the filter going to high or 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.520
 low pass but the high we saw in 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.340
 because last lesson because 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.240
 pass only signals with 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.890
 frequency below the cutoff frequency 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.340
 all signals above the frequency of 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:20.610
 cuts will be attenuated 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.180
 and this termination is all the greater 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:27.210
 the higher the signal frequency in 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.750
 relation to the cutoff frequency 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.380
 so for today we'll finish it the next time 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.630
 class 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.610
 let's look in detail at a filter 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.900
 low pass 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.900
 Until then
