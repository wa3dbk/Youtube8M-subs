I had another porn after 2008 I waited

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.380 
I had another porn after 2008 I waited
five<00:02:21.140> years<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> felt<00:02:22.820> ready<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.270> go

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
five years and now I felt ready to go

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.740 
five years and now I felt ready to go
back<00:02:23.600> maybe<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.350> couple<00:02:24.980> years<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.550> feel<00:02:26.510> ready

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
back maybe a couple years I feel ready

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.170 
back maybe a couple years I feel ready
to<00:02:26.900> go<00:02:27.050> back<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.560> Everest<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.430> when<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.850> go<00:02:29.000> back

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
to go back to Everest but when I go back

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.390 
to go back to Everest but when I go back
it's<00:02:29.780> different<00:02:30.230> feeling<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.740> know<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.160> and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
it's different feeling you know and and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's different feeling you know and and
all<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> way<00:02:32.270> how<00:02:32.510> Everest<00:02:33.170> works<00:02:33.470> now<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> know

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
all the way how Everest works now I know

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.360 
all the way how Everest works now I know
it<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:34.550> better<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.710> willing<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.100> go

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it now better and if I'm willing to go

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.610 
it now better and if I'm willing to go
there<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:38.120> play<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.420> game<00:02:38.450> or<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:39.020> don't<00:02:39.260> go

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
there I just play the game or I don't go

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.030 
there I just play the game or I don't go
there

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
there

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.700 
there
so<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:40.460> accepted<00:02:41.000> that's<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.110> how<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.380> is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
so you're accepted that's just how it is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.880 
so you're accepted that's just how it is
I<00:02:42.740> thought<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.640> accepted<00:02:44.740> even<00:02:45.740> before

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I thought that it accepted even before

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.260 
I thought that it accepted even before
but<00:02:46.900> maybe<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:49.280> was<00:02:49.460> not<00:02:49.990> like<00:02:50.990> what<00:02:51.560> people

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
but maybe it was not like what people

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.600 
but maybe it was not like what people
expect<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.840> mountain<00:02:54.320> do<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.100> think<00:02:55.340> some

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
expect in the mountain do you think some

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.520 
expect in the mountain do you think some
of<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.910> magic<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.630> Everest<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:57.140> gone<00:02:57.350> as<00:02:57.500> a

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
of the the magic of Everest is gone as a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.330 
of the the magic of Everest is gone as a
result<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.070> forever<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.060> I<00:03:00.190> mean<00:03:01.190> the

highest mountain in the world but you

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.170 
highest mountain in the world but you
know<00:03:09.410> there<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.770> all<00:03:10.130> these<00:03:10.400> fixed<00:03:10.640> lines<00:03:10.910> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
know there are all these fixed lines and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
know there are all these fixed lines and
people<00:03:11.450> go<00:03:11.540> up<00:03:11.690> there<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.020> oxygen<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.980> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
people go up there with oxygen and and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460 
people go up there with oxygen and and
then<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.240> up<00:03:14.270> there<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.810> dog<00:03:14.870> see<00:03:15.350> and

then you go up there with a dog see and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.350 
then you go up there with a dog see and
then<00:03:15.710> you<00:03:15.740> have<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.220> explain<00:03:16.400> why<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.880> go<00:03:17.180> with

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
then you have to explain why you go with

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.330 
then you have to explain why you go with
all<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.660> oxygen<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.200> kind<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.620> this

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
all the oxygen it's kind of like this

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.380 
all the oxygen it's kind of like this
magic<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.900> not<00:03:21.140> there<00:03:21.560> anymore<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.910> it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
magic it's not there anymore and it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.440 
magic it's not there anymore and it
wasn't<00:03:23.570> there<00:03:23.989> before

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
wasn't there before

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.240 
wasn't there before
last<00:03:26.450> spring<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.110> climb<00:03:27.650> lots<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.010> people

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
last spring I climb lots of people

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.170 
last spring I climb lots of people
climbing<00:03:28.459> they<00:03:28.700> don't<00:03:28.880> want<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> climb

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
climbing they don't want to climb

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.490 
climbing they don't want to climb
Everest<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.750> don't<00:03:29.900> want<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.080> climb<00:03:30.200> Everest

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
Everest I don't want to climb Everest

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.440 
Everest I don't want to climb Everest
but<00:03:30.709> part<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.580> always<00:03:31.670> wonders<00:03:32.180> what<00:03:32.360> it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
but part of you always wonders what it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.910 
but part of you always wonders what it
must<00:03:32.660> be<00:03:32.750> like<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.020> climb<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.770> that's

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
must be like to climb it and that's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.310 
must be like to climb it and that's
always<00:03:34.130> there<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.910> is<00:03:35.090> no<00:03:35.450> reason<00:03:35.930> because<00:03:36.230> I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
always there this is no reason because I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.720 
always there this is no reason because I
know<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.860> very<00:03:37.040> interesting<00:03:37.310> climb

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
know it's not a very interesting climb

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.610 
know it's not a very interesting climb
but<00:03:38.270> it's<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.750> highest<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.530> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
but it's it's the highest one in the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.620 
but it's it's the highest one in the
world<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.370> altitude<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.239> really

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
world and it's the altitude is really

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.520 
world and it's the altitude is really
interesting<00:03:42.170> yeah<00:03:43.870> 8,848<00:03:44.870> meter<00:03:45.170> that's

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
interesting yeah 8,848 meter that's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.979 
interesting yeah 8,848 meter that's
interesting<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.790> must<00:03:47.030> really<00:03:47.330> notice<00:03:47.810> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
interesting you must really notice that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.650 
interesting you must really notice that
from<00:03:48.320> say<00:03:48.739> Annapurna<00:03:49.190> yeah<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.940> mean<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.330> suppose

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
from say Annapurna yeah I mean I suppose

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.020 
from say Annapurna yeah I mean I suppose
so<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.440> huge<00:03:51.680> difference<00:03:51.860> it's<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.610> he

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
so it's a huge difference it's like he

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.729 
so it's a huge difference it's like he
cannot<00:03:53.330> compare<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.380> yeah<00:03:54.530> with

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
cannot compare that like yeah with

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.190 
cannot compare that like yeah with
altitude<00:03:55.160> yeah<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.150> that's<00:03:56.720> what<00:03:56.900> it's

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
altitude yeah so that's what it's

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.040 
altitude yeah so that's what it's
interesting<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.830> Everest<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:59.050> what

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
interesting on Everest and that what

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.090 
interesting on Everest and that what
makes<00:04:00.080> me<00:04:00.910> accept<00:04:01.910> all<00:04:02.269> around<00:04:02.810> on<00:04:03.050> Everest<00:04:03.560> to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
makes me accept all around on Everest to

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.560 
makes me accept all around on Everest to
go<00:04:04.250> there<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:05.360> get<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.110> impression<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:07.570> you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
go there I get the impression that you

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.949 
go there I get the impression that you
don't<00:04:08.780> always<00:04:08.989> enjoy<00:04:10.450> some<00:04:11.450> elements<00:04:11.900> of

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
don't always enjoy some elements of
