00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 sometimes it looks like houses spring but sometimes 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 it falls again with baking down them 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.900
 was at the psv psv training today 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 prepare for the game against 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.250
 fc groningen but of course wet smoke 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.949
 talked about that football in germany 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.560
 from last week at coined 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.150
 against Barcelona and a day later that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 another spectacular match between 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.779
 dortmund and realmadrid 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.369
 she knows Mark van Bommel well 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 here mark van bommel in the shirt of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 bavaria munich 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 played a role there for a number of years 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.030
 Bommel naturally also played a part 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 Barcelona 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 did you enjoy the week so much 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 go there were fun competitions 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 that level is very nice 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.579
 I'll fill it in that is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.260
 level for us ever again 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.149
 dutch clubs because the german 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 You have played football in recent years 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 huge steps made yes but that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.050
 it will always be a difference 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.950
 we think 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.410
 incidentally as we did the year 2004 2005 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.240
 we can show it occasionally 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 once a structurally okay that 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.960
 forget that distance is way too big and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.210
 they will never catch up again 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 i we are very small country have 14 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.480
 million inhabitants and germany figures 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.610
 but over 90 million there they have 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.320
 of course also many more options 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 there are financial resources at missis 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 cores of sun that have for my own 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
 power of many tens of millions 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 those who also buy players for that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 amounts of EUR 35 37 40 million and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.970
 that is a very good club i have there 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.619
 played it myself for four and a half years 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 that make up crelan but that saves 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 You never is that the new power of 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 europe were munich 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 they have been doing what I am doing for a while 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.830
 just said a very healthy club is one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 of the few in europe maybe in the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.800
 world 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.270
 at that level that I already had 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.140
 Barcelona is also well for the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.940
 catalans 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.229
 howling and starting all over again 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.210
 then I don't know but hazes inside that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 job 6 years in a row you have 100 final champs 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 love and be half a year ago 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.840
 My boss's wages can never be rewarded 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.630
 pick up but sloane is just a whole 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.550
 good club that is probably some 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.619
 will bring new players than its thing 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.569
 is established and it sounds very 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.700
 crazy but four zero is in barcelona 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.500
 maybe possible 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.880
 nice gentleman says that back then they said 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.010
 barcelona can no longer be overtaken 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.660
 so many psv have ever said 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 psv light miles ahead of ajax 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 Amsterdam a taste that is lagging behind 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.740
 never good again and now it becomes precise 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.910
 the reverse said 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.430
 agree to that wave movement where you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.330
 always have to deal with yes I think so 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 well 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.850
 the 80s 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 the psv in the assembly line champion 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.090
 the turn of the century we were there again 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 Now Ajax is champion twice in a row 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.860
 I am not saying they are 3 times in a row 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060
 become a champion and therefore everything 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.380
 possible 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.520
 only the wave movement indeed 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.590
 we owe it we even have land 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.760
 not at the top and so brings mark 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.500
 van bommel us right at it 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.690
 topic of the competition of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.770
 tomorrow the home match against FC 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.030
 groningen 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.190
 anything can happen 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.980
 for example as ajax tomorrow evening at 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.410
 nac in breda loses the pressure 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.670
 is anyway at ajax right now 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.230
 but then we should 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.160
 wait and see what there is already that evening 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.930
 happened 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.850
 it could just be again 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.230
 Saturday that evening fc groningen 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.520
 does not seem like a problem but you have to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.709
 still play him 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.209
 yes indeed it is easier than then 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.739
 saying to each other 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.730
 I happen to have a statistician in it 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.890
 groningen never won once 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.690
 but that is very dangerous because 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.520
 for the lessons to say exactly because 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.020
 sometime will happen sometime sometime 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.480
 be the first time 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.400
 but fact is that psv when you lose 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 ajax and profit on groningen 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.420
 weather played its full part in the fight for 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.860
 Title sat believe it himself in so we 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.959
 play for me 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.519
 number of hours for ajax we have to 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.320
 win a certain not just for it 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.970
 championship but also for 2-place 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.440
 Kevin a doubt weekend 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.180
 strootman worked inside his today 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.890
 training but will be against groningen 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.090
 probably just be in the party 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.140
 and this is the purpose of bommel doe 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.459
 this just before 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.459
 spores against FC Goh
