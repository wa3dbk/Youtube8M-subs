00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.820
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.570
 I'll show you how to install what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.500
 what is Whatsapp 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.240
 on an ipod or ipad like many of you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.650
 you know this application is designed 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.680
 only for what are telephones 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.850
 mobile on this occasion would be for the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.100
 iphone what is the apple 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.980
 I've been going to work for you 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.990
 if they have a simple or simple phone 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.239
 only for what it is to call or 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.570
 sending messages will work for them now 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.410
 that to install it you need a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.860
 phone to which they will send a 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.620
 activation code first we do not have 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.240
 have the jailbreak installed and we're going 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.130
 to open what is Syria 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.740
 we have to wait for him to charge for 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.090
 avoid mistakes and once you have 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.630
 finished loading we're going to go to 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.750
 search for 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.760
 and here we are going to write watts covenant as 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 we can see and before an installed there is no 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.440
 that add none replenishes anything 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.260
 we only look for what is watts pad 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.450
 and here they will give you a say install 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.670
 I appear to modify because I already 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.640
 I have it installed but you are going to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.200
 seem to install once done that they will 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.630
 have to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 and install some 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 some application of that idea to be able 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.539
 install whatsapp what can be my 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.329
 be 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.820
 there is pastor 25 plan or the one that you 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.940
 like 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 once done that install whatsapp 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.440
 and they are going to open it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.480
 this to you is the first time that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 open they're going to this 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.740
 to look like a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.770
 a welcome screen and it's going to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 look like a small space in which 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.150
 they will enter their phone number 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.150
 this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.810
 and two options will appear if 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.960
 they want them to talk to them or send them 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 a message I recommend the message 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.280
 since it is safer 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.269
 since in the call they have to grab 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.500
 a paper to write the number who is 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.110
 message the only thing they can do is 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.330
 copy and paste the confirmation number 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 Once done, they can use what they 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.720
 is the whatsapp on your ipod or ipad I hope 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.380
 the design worked is quite simple 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 as you can see 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 this 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.050
 It works the same as if it were an iphone 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.230
 but the only difference is that they are not going to 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.880
 being able to call from the block is whatsapp 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.040
 you have the option to call the telephone number 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.590
 the other person but they will not be able to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.900
 to do is the only difference I hope them 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.290
 has served and until next time 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.290
 bye
