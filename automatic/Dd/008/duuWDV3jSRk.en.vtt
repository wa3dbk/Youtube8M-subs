00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
little bit harder than you do with your

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
little bit harder than you do with your
finger<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.400> stylus

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
finger when you go to use the stylus

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
tapping as this thing does it becomes

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.910 
tapping as this thing does it becomes
kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> second<00:01:51.720> nature<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.560> actually

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
kind of like second nature and actually

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060 
kind of like second nature and actually
it's<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.369> precise<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.380> said<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it's very precise like I said it's a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's very precise like I said it's a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you put text so for example if I was

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
to actually sign my name on this email I

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.860 
to actually sign my name on this email I
would<00:02:42.019> invoke<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.650> autograph<00:02:43.340> screen<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.180> I

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
would invoke the autograph screen and I

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.410 
would invoke the autograph screen and I
can<00:02:44.900> use<00:02:45.170> my<00:02:45.200> finger<00:02:45.829> if<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.220> want<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:47.180> type<00:02:47.389> my

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420

can use my finger if I want to type my
name<00:02:47.689> and<00:02:48.079> then<00:02:48.889> enter<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:50.569> well

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
name and then enter it in like so well

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.159 
name and then enter it in like so well
guess<00:02:51.859> what<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.280> can<00:02:52.549> use<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.120> styloid<00:02:53.599> stylist

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
guess what I can use the styloid stylist

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.649 
guess what I can use the styloid stylist
instead<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.859> I<00:02:54.889> get<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> much<00:02:55.280> cleaner<00:02:55.700> easier

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
instead and I get a much cleaner easier

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.319 
instead and I get a much cleaner easier
to<00:02:56.780> use<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.079> easier<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.769> read<00:02:57.950> signature<00:02:58.669> and

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
to use and easier to read signature and

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.990 
to use and easier to read signature and
i<00:02:59.629> can<00:02:59.780> write<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.079> just<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.409> a<00:03:00.439> pen<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.000> you

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
i can write it just like a pen and you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.879 
i can write it just like a pen and you
can<00:03:02.180> see<00:03:02.359> i<00:03:02.389> use<00:03:02.659> use<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.109> like<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.319> pen<00:03:03.620> on

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
can see i use use it just like a pen on

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.520 
can see i use use it just like a pen on
the<00:03:03.950> track<00:03:04.489> pad<00:03:04.700> itself<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:06.019> kind<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> does

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the track pad itself and it kind of does

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.129 
the track pad itself and it kind of does
the<00:03:06.560> same<00:03:07.010> thing<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:07.430> i<00:03:08.030> find<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> much<00:03:09.109> easier

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
the same thing but i find it much easier
