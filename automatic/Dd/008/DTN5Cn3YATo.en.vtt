00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.960 

okay<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.100> video<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> explain

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
okay in this video I'm going to explain

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
okay in this video I'm going to explain
how<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> made<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.460> sandy<00:00:20.460> beach<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:21.650> sandy

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
how I made a sandy beach now sandy

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590 
how I made a sandy beach now sandy
beaches<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.400> normally<00:00:23.910> seen<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.210> utter

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
beaches are not normally seen in utter

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.679 
beaches are not normally seen in utter
swimming<00:00:24.990> pools<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.529> sand<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.689> swimming

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
swimming pools because sand and swimming

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
swimming pools because sand and swimming
pool<00:00:27.960> pumps<00:00:28.380> don't<00:00:28.619> normally<00:00:29.010> mix<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.490> well

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
pool pumps don't normally mix very well

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
pool pumps don't normally mix very well
in<00:00:29.849> fact<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> sand<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.720> destroy<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
in fact the sand will destroy the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.250 
in fact the sand will destroy the
swimming<00:00:31.740> pool<00:00:31.949> pump<00:00:32.340> from<00:00:32.669> within<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:34.050> my

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
swimming pool pump from within but my

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
swimming pool pump from within but my
system<00:00:34.649> circulation<00:00:35.250> uses<00:00:35.700> air<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.660> air<00:00:36.960> lift

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
system circulation uses air and air lift

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.369 
system circulation uses air and air lift
pumps<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.910> pretty<00:00:39.450> immune<00:00:39.960> fat

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
pumps so it's pretty immune fat

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
pumps so it's pretty immune fat
completely<00:00:40.920> immune<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> sand<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> thought

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
completely immune to sand so I thought

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
completely immune to sand so I thought
well<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.290> give<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:44.000> because<00:00:45.000> there's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
well let's give it a go because there's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
well let's give it a go because there's
nothing<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:45.960> than<00:00:46.079> sandy<00:00:46.559> beaches<00:00:46.770> there

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
nothing better than sandy beaches there

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.750 
nothing better than sandy beaches there
right<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> standard

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right and so this is the standard

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.350 
right and so this is the standard
profile<00:00:51.480> focal<00:00:52.399> well<00:00:53.399> anyway<00:00:53.940> some<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
profile focal well anyway some of that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.389 
profile focal well anyway some of that
for<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:56.090> natural<00:00:57.090> swimming<00:00:57.420> pool<00:00:57.660> okay<00:01:01.399> here's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
for a natural swimming pool okay here's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.969 
for a natural swimming pool okay here's
the<00:01:02.609> water<00:01:02.820> level<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> deep

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
the water level this is the deep

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.440 
the water level this is the deep
swimming<00:01:04.979> area<00:01:07.729> normally<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:09.060> meters

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
swimming area normally about two meters

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.649 
swimming area normally about two meters
deep<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.400> here<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> planted<00:01:12.510> zone

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
deep and here this is the planted zone

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.200 
deep and here this is the planted zone
what<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> normally<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.210> retaining

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
what we have is normally a retaining

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
what we have is normally a retaining
wall<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.110> sort<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.840> add<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:19.920> layer<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
wall of some sort and add a layer of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.230 
wall of some sort and add a layer of
substrate<00:01:21.799> sand<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> gravel<00:01:23.280> mix<00:01:23.490> yeah<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
substrate sand and gravel mix yeah and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.179 
substrate sand and gravel mix yeah and
here<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.619> plants<00:01:26.009> growing<00:01:26.220> yeah

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
here we can all have plants growing yeah

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.539 
here we can all have plants growing yeah
but<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> particular<00:01:30.360> area<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> pool

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
but for this particular area of the pool

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
but for this particular area of the pool
I'm<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:34.670> my<00:01:35.670> beach<00:01:37.939> okay<00:01:39.259> drama

I'm just gonna have my beach okay drama
water<00:01:40.560> back<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> order<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> reduce

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
water back in and but in order to reduce

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.780 
water back in and but in order to reduce
the<00:01:43.439> amount<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.710> sand<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the amount of sand on it I'm going to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.510 
the amount of sand on it I'm going to
build<00:01:45.000> another<00:01:45.530> retaining<00:01:46.530> wall<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.009> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
build another retaining wall in here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
build another retaining wall in here
because<00:01:47.759> otherwise<00:01:47.970> I'd<00:01:48.240> need<00:01:48.420> tons<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> tons

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
because otherwise I'd need tons and tons

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.859 
because otherwise I'd need tons and tons
of<00:01:49.320> sand<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.710> fill<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> wedge<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of sand to fill that wedge up right so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.999 
of sand to fill that wedge up right so
I'm<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> build<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.530> retaining

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
I'm going to build a little retaining

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.880 
I'm going to build a little retaining
wall<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.880> thought<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> use

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
wall and I thought I'm going to use

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
wall and I thought I'm going to use
sandbags<00:01:55.890> 25<00:01:56.490> kilograms<00:01:57.000> sandbags<00:01:57.450> just

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
sandbags 25 kilograms sandbags just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.090 
sandbags 25 kilograms sandbags just
straight<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.229> come<00:01:58.259> from<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.770> builders

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
straight as they come from a builders

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.569 
straight as they come from a builders
merchants<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> their<00:02:00.360> polythene<00:02:00.630> bags<00:02:01.219> so<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
merchants in their polythene bags so I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.590 
merchants in their polythene bags so I
put<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.939> geotextile<00:02:05.939> nonwoven

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
put down a bit of geotextile nonwoven

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
put down a bit of geotextile nonwoven
geotextile<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> protect<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> bags<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.789> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
geotextile to protect the bags and on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.460 
geotextile to protect the bags and on
top<00:02:10.160> or<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
top or of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.310 
top or of
eggs<00:02:12.620> but<00:02:13.190> also<00:02:13.420> because<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.570> polythene<00:02:14.900> is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
eggs but also because this polythene is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.620 
eggs but also because this polythene is
not<00:02:15.470> particularly<00:02:15.770> strong<00:02:16.240> I've<00:02:17.240> trapped

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
not particularly strong I've trapped

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.650 
not particularly strong I've trapped
underneath<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.530> bit<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.310> scrap<00:02:19.790> liner<00:02:20.210> that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
underneath a bit of scrap liner that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.480 
underneath a bit of scrap liner that
comes<00:02:21.020> up<00:02:21.170> over<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> face<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.770> then<00:02:22.160> back

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
comes up over the face and then back

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.000 
comes up over the face and then back
over<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.970> top<00:02:23.210> like<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.750> okay<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.620> they're

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
over the top like that okay so they're

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.570 
over the top like that okay so they're
not<00:02:25.160> protecting<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> face<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> wall<00:02:27.580> on

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
not protecting the face of the wall on

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.420 
not protecting the face of the wall on
top<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.840> put<00:02:30.560> another<00:02:31.070> layer<00:02:31.370> of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
top of that I put another layer of

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.620 
top of that I put another layer of
geotextile<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:33.140> comes<00:02:33.350> down<00:02:33.440> up<00:02:34.330> over<00:02:35.330> here

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
geotextile just comes down up over here

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.040 
geotextile just comes down up over here
and<00:02:36.100> sits<00:02:37.100> on<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> top<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.910> war<00:02:38.210> right<00:02:38.780> I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050
