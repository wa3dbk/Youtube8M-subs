00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the keyboard and I mean I suppose if you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.729 
the keyboard and I mean I suppose if you
wanted<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.579> could<00:03:03.730> hit<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.359> now<00:03:05.200> actually

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739

three<00:03:10.630> golden<00:03:10.959> keys<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.220> just

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
three golden keys and then you can just

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.140 
three golden keys and then you can just
go<00:03:12.519> right<00:03:12.549> back<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.150> there<00:03:14.819> start<00:03:15.819> grabbing

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.240 

I<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.750> right

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.160 

actually<00:03:36.090> giving<00:03:36.800> stop<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:41.750> yeah<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.960> works

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
actually giving stop it yeah it works

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:54.910 
actually giving stop it yeah it works
better<00:03:43.380> off<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.710> a<00:03:43.800> website

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.770 

and<00:03:55.370> then<00:03:55.610> these<00:03:55.880> codes<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.390> I'm<00:03:56.510> entering

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and then these codes that I'm entering

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.800 
and then these codes that I'm entering
right<00:03:56.990> now<00:03:57.200> these<00:03:58.130> expire<00:03:58.670> in<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.390> couple<00:03:59.750> of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
right now these expire in a couple of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.540 
right now these expire in a couple of
days<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:04.480> mean<00:04:05.480> if<00:04:05.599> you're<00:04:05.750> watching<00:04:05.930> this

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
five days from now then they probably

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.440 
five days from now then they probably
won't<00:04:09.950> be<00:04:10.099> any<00:04:10.250> good<00:04:10.340> anymore<00:04:10.640> there<00:04:11.360> were
