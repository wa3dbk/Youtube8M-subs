00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.950
 So I'm looking forward to any case 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.619
 The marathon is a big one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.779
 challenge never actually 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 made something comparable and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.600
 I'm very curious if that's me 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.810
 I have respect for everyone 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.000
 If you want babbel you can go there too 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 As I said so 42 km is completely me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.740
 nice rod i hope thats me 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 I can not get it already 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.430
 queasy feeling because the first marathon 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.960
 also i am with i am running 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 before you only have ten kilometers of runs 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 So taken no half marathon 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 but i run quite regularly 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 So three times a week minimum and also 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 in a city park so at least 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 seven kilometers approximately and like one 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 we do not do that at all 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 rather provide mental staying power 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.620
 to participate in the marathon at all 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 we had to go in before 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.670
 given medical examinations and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770
 But Ariane and I are 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.899
 Meanwhile, the other colleagues 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 one saturday to the university of hamburg 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.020
 drove and we were there at the sport 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.430
 medical faculty examine 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
 let and that was very interesting 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.869
 that means there were different tests over 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 how resilient track is right then 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.840
 really to walk on the treadmill where 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.520
 We then get faster and faster in intervals 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.259
 had to run that was the highest 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.790
 exhausting that's the usual way 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.590
 program by the way synonymous profi 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.549
 Football players just have to graduate 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 they keep that a bit, of course 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.210
 longer than I did but nothing 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.180
 it came out that we are in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 grunde all top healthy and all the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 may participate marathon is ever 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.009
 there was still a good news for me 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.810
 a little beside message namely that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 I have to train a lot because 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 I just do not stop that much yet 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 have done sports in the last twelve 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.329
 months 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.950
 I'm curious so I believe that I'm there 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.429
 somewhere deep within me a very good one 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.329
 reason 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.499
 But we have equipment 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.509
 back now out again 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.460
 I usually watch him 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.020
 My body that is when I'm on Mondays 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.729
 I'm trying to run somehow 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.109
 actually even tuesday wednesday 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.549
 to run thursday 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.380
 and now I'm trying to get it 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.959
 marathon in the training plan to run that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.289
 means I always have a rest day 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:10.489
 running in between lasts longer runs 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:14.180
 I have the heart rate watch from so under the 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.860
 mp3 and you can actually do it that well 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.260
 how can you see your pace 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.510
 you can see how miles you see 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.280
 have already covered you can 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 even set the pedometer for the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.299
 day and you see the course 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.250
 Pulse rate it is of course one 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.810
 additional motivation boost for clear 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.730
 who now see you like you 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.680
 Run and of course maybe 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.000
 before that you are always faster 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
 but not even more 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.109
 should be on the track 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.519
 8 had and that's all right 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.030
 thrilling capable of the yet again to 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.799
 see 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.799
 I have a very simple heart rate monitor 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.569
 measures and exactly and that's it 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.920
 So steps and pulse and that's it 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.630
 then actually i actually have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.730
 I do not know when I have any 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.519
 I have a pulse or how much of it and am 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.019
 certainly very confident that I 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.160
 because learn more about myself and 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.260
 the whole then still can estimate 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.269
 because you know that if that one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.440
 heart beats to the throat and knows that 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.630
 then maybe that's just what 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.079
 Actually, that means the worst 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.120
 when I am physically and physically healthy 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.220
 actually the marathon would have come to an end 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.500
 but can run mentally abandoned 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.780
 that is, if it were small 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
 would have given hurt and I then 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.569
 I had said that I can do it 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.500
 No more that was for me 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.700
 worst case 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.900
 but if I'm really at this 430 there 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.760
 So if it really arrived 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.530
 exactly works with this training plan 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.560
 that of course we are the top again 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.140
 that was very nice it would be natural 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.880
 Have a nice time afterwards 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.700
 somehow still able to be too 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.770
 stand that is that would be very nice just 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.150
 case would be natural if we always 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.750
 I have to stop because I am so 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.400
 I am slow 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.410
 that certainly comes before weimar addons 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.410
 and that can not be the goal
