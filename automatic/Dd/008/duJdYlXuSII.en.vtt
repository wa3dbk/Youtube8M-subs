 as I told you before to 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.349
 and if you ever make a mistake when 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.659
 dates or during a campaign or during 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.359

 zone revalidate again has my 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.079
 campaign and she was updated 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.190
 slate but following the questionnaire that 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.109
 we did some time ago 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.720
 we had a lot of questions and 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.239
 we get a lot of mail from 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.069
 free on the internet 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.290
