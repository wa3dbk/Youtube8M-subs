00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.910
 of the present images we see a 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.940
 dishwasher with excessive consumption of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 salt that fills the salt deposit and the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 same I go back to the emptiness 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.930
 and this is the aspect presented by the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.280
 dishes 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.280
 totally stained 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:46.010
 one of the things that observed is that the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:49.390
 salt plug tends to slacken 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.390
 jumping the same 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.850
 after testing with the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.550
 dishwasher the same continues consuming 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.490
 quite salt and try to perform a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 washing by placing tape detection not on 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.030
 the edge of the plug thread the same 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 it tends to twist rather well 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 happens that still jumps I'm going to try 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.610
 now to fill all the interior of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.280
 glue in order to get reinforce 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.860
 the side walls and that those that we 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.670
 before and with a bit of luck not having 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.670
 to buy a plug 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.229
 once the cap has been filled with 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.360
 Two-component glue has the same 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.220
 solidified 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.750
 and it is completely when filling the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 hollow I will proceed to replace the plug 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.140
 Previously fill in salt to check 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.590
 if it wears out or really 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590
 maintains 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.750
 before the first test the stopper 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.550
 apparently he's squeezing enough 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 all right 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.410
 so if the problem was leakage from 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.090
 water by the top of the plug by 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.140
 lack of hermetism of the same 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 problem will be solved 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.600
 we will see again that candid washing 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.600
 Once the salt is back, we check that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 the plug is tight 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.140
 and place some plates to see if the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.270
 they appear in gestures of sant 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.890
 after washing and I will proceed to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.890
 perform the test because so has gone 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.319
 Once the washing is finished, proceed 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.640
 check the dishes while they are the same 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.640
 perfectly clean without debris 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:53.100
 we should check the salt deposit and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.680
 observed that the machine contrary to 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.440
 glÃ¼ck did the previous time has not 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 consumed all the always the same 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.500
 therefore the problem we did not have 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.050
 located 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.440
 in the closing cap of the tank 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.970
 salt is the same does not magnetically approach 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.480
 therefore of the machine consumed a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.940
 excess of salt coming to consume 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.210
 totally a deposit with one or two no 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.210
 fords 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.800
 i 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.790
 I hope the video can be from 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.920
 help and before a problem of a consumption 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.310
 excessive salt first thing that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.220
 prove you will be the hermetic seal 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.830
 the cap of the salt deposit 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.400
 Greetings to all and keep visiting 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.440
 in the web 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.750
 prepare yourself 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 finally after making 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.230
 tests by sticking the plug 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.689
 it has not worked and I will have to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.189
 buy a spare plug on 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.459
 Two-component glue has been 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.910
 cut has taken a tonality not 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.610
 rosacea 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.820
 and the same with the temperature of 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.170
 dishwasher has lost in consistency 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.260
 so the plug when looking for it 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.670
 if we press the same strongly arrives 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.299
 to let go 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.940
 when released during washing 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.060
 Miami water pressure inside 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.990
 of the deposit coming out the edges of the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.409
 plug so the salt tank 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.180
 dishwasher in the emptying buy a 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.180
 spare and its writing the same
