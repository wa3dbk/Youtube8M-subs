unbelievable<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.780> many<00:01:40.049> mobs<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.860> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
unbelievable how many mobs it's like

every<00:01:42.030> game<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.869> no<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
every game I have no up or not me but

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.090 
every game I have no up or not me but
every<00:01:45.119> game<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> MOAB<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> game

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
every game there is a MOAB in the game

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
every game there is a MOAB in the game
and<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.630> annoying

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and and that's so that it's not annoying

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
and and that's so that it's not annoying
they<00:01:49.350> earn<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
they earn it but that's kind of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.149 
they earn it but that's kind of
defeating<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> purpose<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.649> getting<00:01:52.860> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
more but normally it is so hard to get

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 
more but normally it is so hard to get
ammo<00:02:09.060> up<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:10.110> why<00:02:10.379> people

that<00:04:16.079> game<00:04:16.380> type<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.889> don't<00:04:17.280> know<00:04:17.459> what

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669

they're<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.209> do<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:19.650> it's

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
they're going to do and I think it's

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.289 
they're going to do and I think it's
going<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.010> be<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> next<00:04:20.639> month<00:04:20.849> that<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
going to be in the next month that the

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.730 
going to be in the next month that the
Roxxon<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.780> coming<00:04:22.049> back<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.380> might<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.710> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
Roxxon is coming back that might be a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.589 
Roxxon is coming back that might be a
long<00:04:22.979> time<00:04:23.310> span<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:23.760> i<00:04:23.820> think<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.270> going<00:04:24.479> to

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
long time span but i think it's going to

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.750 
long time span but i think it's going to
be<00:04:24.719> within<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.770> month<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.190> course

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
be within the month of course

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.300 
be within the month of course
but<00:04:27.120> i'm<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:27.900> sure<00:04:27.960> i'm<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.770> guessing<00:04:28.950> here

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
but i'm not sure i'm just guessing here

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.910 
but i'm not sure i'm just guessing here
so<00:04:29.520> don't<00:04:30.120> take<00:04:30.390> me<00:04:30.600> any<00:04:30.780> serious<00:04:31.290> will<00:04:31.710> take

with<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.460> their<00:05:30.060> win-loss<00:05:30.240> ratio<00:05:30.810> because<00:05:31.140> you

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
with it their win-loss ratio because you

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.190 
with it their win-loss ratio because you
always<00:05:31.470> win<00:05:31.980> so<00:05:32.580> that's<00:05:33.360> got<00:05:33.660> its<00:05:33.870> always

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
always win so that's got its always

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440 
always win so that's got its always
comes<00:05:34.470> as<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.710> win<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:35.220> if<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:35.970> killing

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
comes as a win and if you like killing

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.300 
comes as a win and if you like killing
people<00:05:36.660> you<00:05:37.140> get<00:05:37.290> infected<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.800> just<00:05:38.100> lay

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
people you get infected you just lay

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.130 
people you get infected you just lay
down<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.670> have<00:05:38.760> nine<00:05:39.030> KD<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.600> it<00:05:39.690> counts<00:05:40.020> up

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
down you have nine KD and it counts up

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.410 
down you have nine KD and it counts up
to<00:05:40.260> your<00:05:40.410> KD<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:41.250> i<00:05:41.280> don't<00:05:41.580> know<00:05:41.670> why<00:05:41.880> they

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
to your KD so i don't know why they

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.080 
to your KD so i don't know why they
should<00:05:42.810> actually<00:05:43.070> let<00:05:44.070> it<00:05:44.190> count<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.610> Arkady

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
should actually let it count you Arkady

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.030 
should actually let it count you Arkady
or<00:05:45.480> are<00:05:45.630> we<00:05:45.810> lost<00:05:45.990> ratio<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.410> think<00:05:46.740> they<00:05:46.830> should

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
or are we lost ratio I think they should

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.730 
or are we lost ratio I think they should
change<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.430> too<00:05:47.930> but<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.020> don't<00:05:49.080> know<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.530> and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
change that too but I don't know and and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.130 
change that too but I don't know and and
they<00:05:49.860> should<00:05:50.040> also<00:05:50.190> change<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.960> how<00:05:51.960> many

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
they should also change the how many

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.160 
they should also change the how many
people<00:05:52.500> unite<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.190> at<00:05:54.030> which<00:05:54.540> point<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:55.050> were

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
people unite and at which point you were

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.630 
people unite and at which point you were
knife<00:05:55.350> I<00:05:55.530> think<00:05:55.710> they<00:05:55.800> should<00:05:55.950> add<00:05:56.130> that<00:05:56.160> into

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
knife I think they should add that into

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.890 
knife I think they should add that into
the<00:05:56.820> school<00:05:57.210> boots<00:05:57.420> but<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:57.630> don't<00:05:57.840> think

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
the school boots but I don't think

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.350 
the school boots but I don't think
they're<00:05:58.080> going<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.320> do<00:05:58.440> that<00:05:58.560> because<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:59.070> the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
they're going to do that because of the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.400 
they're going to do that because of the
scoreboards<00:06:00.360> in<00:06:00.480> 10<00:06:00.630> off<00:06:00.780> at<00:06:00.960> three<00:06:01.200> weren't

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
scoreboards in 10 off at three weren't

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.220 
scoreboards in 10 off at three weren't
so<00:06:01.650> good<00:06:01.830> from<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.370> start<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:03.510> might<00:06:03.900> like

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
so good from the start I might like

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.730 
so good from the start I might like
asked<00:06:04.800> you<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.340> try<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.610> change<00:06:05.730> that<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:06.960> I'm

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
asked you and try to change that but I'm

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.260 
asked you and try to change that but I'm
just<00:06:08.130> going<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.340> ask<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.730> Twitter<00:06:08.940> or<00:06:09.090> send

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
just going to ask and Twitter or send

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.480 
just going to ask and Twitter or send
them<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.450> male<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.840> try<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.140> to<00:06:10.920> get<00:06:11.070> something

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
them a male and try to to get something

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.550 
them a male and try to to get something
through<00:06:11.760> to<00:06:12.240> change<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.810> scoreboard<00:06:13.470> in

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
through to change the scoreboard in

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.170 
through to change the scoreboard in
domination<00:06:13.950> and<00:06:14.160> stuff<00:06:14.370> also<00:06:14.550> so<00:06:14.790> you<00:06:14.910> can<00:06:15.060> see

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
domination and stuff also so you can see

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.090 
domination and stuff also so you can see
how<00:06:15.210> many<00:06:15.420> flags<00:06:15.750> were<00:06:15.960> kept<00:06:16.230> and<00:06:16.380> stuff<00:06:16.590> so

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
how many flags were kept and stuff so

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.830 
how many flags were kept and stuff so
one<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:17.550> think<00:06:17.970> that's<00:06:18.120> important<00:06:18.570> that<00:06:18.690> they

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
one I think that's important that they

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.100 
one I think that's important that they
changed<00:06:19.350> the<00:06:20.360> scoreboard<00:06:21.360> but<00:06:21.570> that's

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
changed the scoreboard but that's

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.500 
changed the scoreboard but that's
important<00:06:22.590> for<00:06:22.710> me<00:06:22.890> at<00:06:23.250> least<00:06:23.340> I<00:06:23.850> need<00:06:24.270> to<00:06:24.360> know

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
important for me at least I need to know

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.500 
important for me at least I need to know
how<00:06:25.320> many<00:06:25.380> people<00:06:25.590> then<00:06:26.190> kept<00:06:26.640> the<00:06:26.850> flag<00:06:27.120> or

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
how many people then kept the flag or

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.810 
how many people then kept the flag or
whatever<00:06:28.230> they<00:06:28.380> did<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:29.370> this<00:06:29.520> is<00:06:29.670> actually

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
whatever they did and this is actually

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.080 
whatever they did and this is actually
also<00:06:30.300> with<00:06:30.690> glitz<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.260> as<00:06:31.470> you<00:06:31.680> know<00:06:32.090> there's

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
also with glitz so as you know there's

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
also with glitz so as you know there's
only<00:06:33.330> one<00:06:33.630> person<00:06:34.080> left<00:06:34.110> but<00:06:35.870> because<00:06:36.870> of<00:06:36.900> the

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
only one person left but because of the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.400 
only one person left but because of the
Moab<00:06:37.520> there<00:06:38.520> were<00:06:38.640> no<00:06:38.850> people<00:06:39.030> left<00:06:39.390> and<00:06:39.690> the

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
Moab there were no people left and the
