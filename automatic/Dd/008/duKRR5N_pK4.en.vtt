00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:16.240

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:19.210
 third type present a book and it is a bit 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.390
 how to talk about their children children 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.119
 I have three region limits 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 this is the third type but this is very much 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.750
 particular 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.360
 I was in my belief that I had 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.430
 done a certain certain thing for 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.320
 all my life or being 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.629
 always close to people to help them 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.540
 to improve their performance by 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.199
 first as an athletic trainer then as 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.809
 mental coach 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 my current profession but felt 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.550
 that something was missing I came into 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.740
 help a vision the vision of mine 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.420
 first ringo ringo dog showed up and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.420
 and he told me but you are sure 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 I was sure he invents but I was sure then 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.310
 it's not after the retrospection is gone 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.440
 I went back in time and I am 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.300
 I have a conculse little boy 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 learned that the thing I always did 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.630
 and being with dogs being like that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.399
 company to stand as a relationship to be 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.250
 as a sport, stay as training and 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.880
 stay with dogs not on live 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 without the dog 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.860
 then another identity crisis 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.289
 What you want to be I 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.780
 remembered that still in elementary school 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.600
 I loved writing so much and they told me 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.780
 who then Bravin how I syringo 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.500
 I said but why don't you write why not 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.660
 brings together the experiences you have and in 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.569
 this way help people 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.450
 improve the relationship with us then dogs 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.950
 learned so many things in life 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.549
 I helped you but everyone helped you 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.970
 the other dogs that came later 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.250
 why not do it you know I did it 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.970
 Convince myself I got convinced 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.269
 started writing without a trace 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.620
 only written on a party and arringo 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.650
 I started from what he did 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.530
 I teach from his mission in life from 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.400
 what he wanted to do what he wanted 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.860
 do for me and from there came the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.170
 interrelationship between the possibility that you 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.139
 give the dogs to manage to control you 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.549
 better to permanently improve the 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:00.030
 your way of staying the way you 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:02.799
 then relate to them with experience 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.810
 in recent years in working with dogs 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.200
 led me to the creation of 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.489
 this method and after the double boom 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.500
 link the method in which the dog will 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.010
 helps you manage your states better 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.829
 mood 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.389
 the songs in shape if you are the best 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.889
 county fit if you are quiet the 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.690
 fallen in shape if you are agitated and the dogs 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.920
 give you that chance to 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.660
 improve and extended to grow 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.540
 normally it happens in the dog world 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.280
 that when you go to an instructor you 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.930
 they permanently say what you should 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.269
 do to get better with your dog 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.920
 that you need to be calmer davis 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.519
 and the more relaxed you have to be more 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.370
 energetic but I discovered that nobody is 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.610
 says the co 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.900
 but actually to tell you how they are 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.180
 these wonderful living beings 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.600
 for us these wonderful being who 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.850
 they love unconditionally that they bond 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.220
 deeply until your soul speaks 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.470
 of cannes and contains this method the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.210
 method that helps you but not spirit 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.210
 not my dogs written 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.410
 they want to help us improve the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.520
 relationship with them and they do it from theirs 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.590
 angle from their point of view 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.280
 they want to give you a method that allows you 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.990
 to feel better with them but above all 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.220
 they want to give you a method that allows you 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.220
 to feel better about yourself
