the<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.750> new<00:01:41.170> flair<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:42.430> does<00:01:42.820> replace<00:01:43.210> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the the new flair is it does replace the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500 
the the new flair is it does replace the
quad<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.160> what<00:01:45.940> we've<00:01:46.090> done<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.390> we've

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
quad and what we've done is we've

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.130 
quad and what we've done is we've
basically<00:01:46.750> made<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.890> baby<00:01:48.250> maverick<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.480> it's<00:01:49.900> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
basically made a baby maverick so it's a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.770 
basically made a baby maverick so it's a
slightly<00:01:50.500> smaller<00:01:50.770> version<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.280> Maverick

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
slightly smaller version of the Maverick

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.390 
slightly smaller version of the Maverick
it<00:01:52.780> uses<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.170> lot<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.530> same<00:01:53.710> parts<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.220> I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
it uses a lot of the same parts as I

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.960 
it uses a lot of the same parts as I
showed<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.940> but<00:01:55.210> earlier<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:56.700> yeah<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:57.850> got

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
showed you but earlier and yeah it's got

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.690 
showed you but earlier and yeah it's got
a<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.660> using<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.200> same<00:01:59.410> rail<00:01:59.650> mount<00:01:59.950> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
a we using the same rail mount the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.800 
a we using the same rail mount the
gimbal<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.060> slightly<00:02:01.240> smaller<00:02:01.450> than<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
gimbal is slightly smaller than the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.480 
gimbal is slightly smaller than the
Maverick<00:02:02.200> smaller<00:02:02.500> motors<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.340> all-in-all

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
Maverick smaller motors so all-in-all

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.000 
Maverick smaller motors so all-in-all
it's<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.780> know<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.930> little<00:02:05.470> version<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
it's you know a little version of the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.260 
it's you know a little version of the
Maverick

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660 

I<00:02:11.300> think<00:02:12.170> what<00:02:12.620> we've<00:02:12.800> done<00:02:13.040> from<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> start

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
I think what we've done from the start

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.570 
I think what we've done from the start
is<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:14.060> create<00:02:14.450> an<00:02:14.540> open<00:02:14.870> try<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.740> pad<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:16.160> we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
is is create an open try and pad for we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.880 
is is create an open try and pad for we
were<00:02:16.970> not<00:02:17.180> camera<00:02:18.140> specific<00:02:18.590> we're<00:02:18.740> not

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
were not camera specific we're not

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.130 
were not camera specific we're not
payload<00:02:19.880> specific<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.450> lot<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.660> our<00:02:20.720> clients<00:02:21.020> on

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
payload specific a lot of our clients on

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.660 
payload specific a lot of our clients on
flying<00:02:21.440> cameras<00:02:21.830> they're<00:02:22.010> flying<00:02:22.220> different

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
flying cameras they're flying different

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.370 
flying cameras they're flying different
pilots<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.240> know<00:02:23.330> senses<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
pilots you know senses and this and that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.190 
pilots you know senses and this and that
so<00:02:24.850> that's<00:02:25.850> what<00:02:26.000> we've<00:02:26.150> been<00:02:26.510> trying<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.080> do

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
so that's what we've been trying to do

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.630 
so that's what we've been trying to do
from<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> start<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.070> found<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.400> really

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
from the start and we found that really

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.480 
from the start and we found that really
well<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.840> buy<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.290> flare<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.340> can

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
well so you can buy a flare and you can

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.400 
well so you can buy a flare and you can
mount<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.730> GoPro<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:32.870> mount<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.080> GoPro

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
mount a GoPro one you can mount a GoPro

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.780 
mount a GoPro one you can mount a GoPro
to<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.710> good<00:02:33.830> man<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> GoPro<00:02:34.130> three<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> can

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
to you good man a GoPro three you can

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.630 
to you good man a GoPro three you can
either<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.090> up<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.300> four<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.590> could<00:02:36.740> mount<00:02:37.340> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
either go up or four you could mount a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120 
either go up or four you could mount a
range<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.120> smaller<00:02:39.050> compact<00:02:39.440> cameras<00:02:39.830> you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
range of smaller compact cameras you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.470 
range of smaller compact cameras you
could<00:02:40.280> literally<00:02:40.580> fly<00:02:40.910> hundreds<00:02:41.390> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
could literally fly hundreds of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.450 
could literally fly hundreds of
different<00:02:41.570> cameras<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> flare<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
different cameras on the flare and the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.580 
different cameras on the flare and the
Maverick<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.030> mean<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.510> opens<00:02:45.080> up<00:02:45.200> even<00:02:45.320> more

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
Maverick I mean that opens up even more

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.970 
Maverick I mean that opens up even more
than<00:02:45.740> any<00:02:45.890> X<00:02:46.870> larger<00:02:47.870> video<00:02:48.380> cameras<00:02:48.770> even

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
than any X larger video cameras even

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.500 
than any X larger video cameras even
smaller<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.460> laws<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.970> be<00:02:50.000> flying<00:02:50.270> on<00:02:50.420> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
smaller so laws can be flying on the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.790 
smaller so laws can be flying on the
Maverick<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.990> that's<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:51.320> we've<00:02:51.470> we've<00:02:51.770> done

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
Maverick so that's what we've we've done

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.860 
Maverick so that's what we've we've done
with<00:02:52.190> both<00:02:52.490> these<00:02:52.640> models<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:53.630> an<00:02:53.750> open

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
with both these models is it's an open

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.410 
with both these models is it's an open
camera<00:02:54.590> platform<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.240> main

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
camera platform so that's the main

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.470 
camera platform so that's the main
reason<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.140> well<00:02:57.320> as<00:02:57.440> obviously<00:02:57.860> our<00:02:58.850> rapid

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
reason or as well as obviously our rapid

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.240 
reason or as well as obviously our rapid
deploy<00:02:59.750> airframe<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.650> know<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.890> very<00:03:01.070> few

airframes you can actually grab without

airframes you can actually grab without

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
tools literally just bend throw the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.910 
tools literally just bend throw the
backpack<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.440> know<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.680> actually

backpack and you know you can actually
travel<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.610> them<00:03:07.850> practically<00:03:08.720> everyday

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
travel with them practically everyday

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.960 
travel with them practically everyday
it's<00:03:09.380> not<00:03:09.500> something<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:09.920> need<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.280> setup<00:03:10.730> you

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
it's not something you need to setup you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.150 
it's not something you need to setup you
know<00:03:11.090> there's<00:03:11.270> pie<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:11.930> is

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
know there's pie one is is

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.350 
know there's pie one is is
futuristic-looking<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.700> cool<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.180> should

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
futuristic-looking it's cool it should

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.770 
futuristic-looking it's cool it should
do<00:03:14.480> well<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:14.810> it's<00:03:15.050> DJI<00:03:16.300> but<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.660> know

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
do well because it's DJI but you know

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.240 
do well because it's DJI but you know
try<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.140> stick<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.800> backpack<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
try to stick that in the backpack and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.860 
try to stick that in the backpack and
hike<00:03:19.580> up<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.850> mountain<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.690> it's

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
hike up a mountain it's just it's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.960 
hike up a mountain it's just it's
impossible<00:03:21.470> not<00:03:22.430> impossible

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
impossible not impossible

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.150

it<00:03:23.090> becomes<00:03:23.450> very<00:03:23.540> impractical<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.830> lot<00:03:25.010> of

it becomes very impractical in a lot of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.040 
it becomes very impractical in a lot of
cases<00:03:25.400> for<00:03:25.670> professionals<00:03:26.300> who<00:03:26.480> use<00:03:26.720> these

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
cases for professionals who use these

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.940 
cases for professionals who use these
tools<00:03:27.290> every<00:03:27.590> day<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:29.300> again<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.960> mean<00:03:30.230> our

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
tools every day and again I mean our

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.650 
tools every day and again I mean our
clients<00:03:31.430> fly<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:31.910> many<00:03:32.090> different<00:03:32.360> cameras

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
clients fly so many different cameras

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.770 
clients fly so many different cameras
depending<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.140> their<00:03:33.320> needs<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.830> you're<00:03:34.310> not

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
depending on their needs so you're not

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.690 
depending on their needs so you're not
limited<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:36.440> camera<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:36.920> might<00:03:37.280> not<00:03:37.520> do

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
limited to one camera that might not do

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.400 
limited to one camera that might not do
what<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.000> really<00:03:38.240> wanted<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.540> do

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.970 

it's<00:03:43.950> basically<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.090> updated<00:03:45.980> two

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
it's basically this is the updated two

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.700 
it's basically this is the updated two
axis<00:03:47.250> gimbal<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.300> flare<00:03:49.020> it's<00:03:49.440> slightly

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
axis gimbal for the flare it's slightly

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.490 
axis gimbal for the flare it's slightly
different<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.790> quad<00:03:51.500> this

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
different to the one on the quad this

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.620 
different to the one on the quad this
bracket<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.310> very<00:03:53.550> similar<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.270> other<00:03:54.480> one

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
bracket is very similar to the other one

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.800 
bracket is very similar to the other one
but<00:03:54.750> you'll<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:55.020> there's<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> whole<00:03:55.440> new

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
but you'll see there's a whole new

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.040 
but you'll see there's a whole new
adjustable<00:03:58.700> pitch<00:03:59.700> bracket<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> could

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
adjustable pitch bracket so you could

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.360 
adjustable pitch bracket so you could
loosen<00:04:01.320> those<00:04:01.470> four<00:04:01.740> you'll<00:04:01.950> see<00:04:02.130> there's<00:04:02.280> a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
loosen those four you'll see there's a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.920 
loosen those four you'll see there's a
two<00:04:02.730> carbon<00:04:02.940> fiber<00:04:03.180> pads<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.690> then<00:04:03.810> an

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
two carbon fiber pads and then an

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.320 
two carbon fiber pads and then an
aluminium<00:04:04.260> bracket<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.550> what<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.270> basically

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
aluminium bracket so what that basically

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.380 
aluminium bracket so what that basically
does<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.140> allows<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:08.000> huge<00:04:09.000> amount<00:04:09.300> of

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
does is it allows a huge amount of

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.050 
does is it allows a huge amount of
movement<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.290> adjustability<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:11.820> you're

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
movement and adjustability so if you're

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.730 
movement and adjustability so if you're
using<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.720> waterproof<00:04:13.230> case<00:04:13.410> if<00:04:13.650> you're

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
using the waterproof case if you're

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.740 
using the waterproof case if you're
using<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.130> skeleton<00:04:14.670> casing<00:04:15.210> you<00:04:15.630> know

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
using the skeleton casing you know

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.300 
using the skeleton casing you know
there's<00:04:16.080> weight<00:04:16.410> differences<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.070> obviously

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
there's weight differences and obviously

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.770 
there's weight differences and obviously
being<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.790> brushless<00:04:18.000> gimbal<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.480> needs<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
being a brushless gimbal it needs to be

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.810 
being a brushless gimbal it needs to be
balanced<00:04:19.110> perfectly<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.800> it<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:20.310> allows<00:04:20.610> you

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
balanced perfectly so it this allows you

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.700 
balanced perfectly so it this allows you
to<00:04:20.940> completely<00:04:21.450> adjust<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.050> GoPro<00:04:22.590> you

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
to completely adjust the the GoPro you

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.640 
to completely adjust the the GoPro you
know<00:04:22.830> either<00:04:23.010> back<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.730> down<00:04:23.900> forward<00:04:24.900> or

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
know either back up and down forward or

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.700 
know either back up and down forward or
back<00:04:25.920> you<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.960> also<00:04:27.960> obviously<00:04:28.170> we<00:04:28.500> have

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
back you know and also obviously we have

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.520 
back you know and also obviously we have
the<00:04:28.890> sliding<00:04:29.730> rolls<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.260> entire

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
the sliding rolls so the the entire

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.230 
the sliding rolls so the the entire
gimbal<00:04:31.920> can<00:04:32.070> adjust<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> Maverick

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
gimbal can adjust just like the Maverick

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.150 
gimbal can adjust just like the Maverick
on<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.840> larger<00:04:34.170> scale<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.710> adjust<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
on a larger scale you can adjust the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.310 
on a larger scale you can adjust the
angle<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.610> camera<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.930> gimbal<00:04:37.200> is

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
angle of the camera the the gimbal is

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.190 
angle of the camera the the gimbal is
completely<00:04:37.890> adjustable<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:39.390> another<00:04:39.990> night

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
completely adjustable and another night

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.620 
completely adjustable and another night
this<00:04:40.560> gimbal<00:04:40.950> also<00:04:41.280> tilts<00:04:41.580> all<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.850> way<00:04:41.940> up<00:04:42.030> so

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
this gimbal also tilts all the way up so

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.540 
this gimbal also tilts all the way up so
you<00:04:43.050> know<00:04:43.140> for<00:04:43.320> roof<00:04:43.470> inspections<00:04:44.070> building

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
you know for roof inspections building

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.480 
you know for roof inspections building
inspections<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:46.080> ideal<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.680> again<00:04:47.220> another

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
inspections it's ideal and again another

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.670 
inspections it's ideal and again another
reason<00:04:48.270> we<00:04:48.420> like<00:04:48.600> having<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.320> front

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
reason we like having of the front

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.230 
reason we like having of the front
mounted<00:04:50.040> gimbal<00:04:50.370> instead<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.090> having

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
mounted gimbal instead of having

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.060 
mounted gimbal instead of having
underneath<00:04:51.720> is<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.170> just<00:04:52.470> makes<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.890> more

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
underneath is it just makes it more

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.740 
underneath is it just makes it more
versatile<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.730> can<00:04:53.790> tilt<00:04:54.090> up<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.390> can<00:04:54.540> tilt

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
versatile you can tilt up you can tilt

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.380 
versatile you can tilt up you can tilt
down<00:04:55.250> get<00:04:56.250> some<00:04:56.400> pretty<00:04:56.700> interesting<00:04:56.910> shots

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
down get some pretty interesting shots

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.460 
down get some pretty interesting shots
yeah<00:04:58.320> so<00:04:58.590> there<00:04:58.830> we're<00:04:59.280> only<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.820> rail<00:05:00.030> system

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
yeah so there we're only a rail system

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.050 
yeah so there we're only a rail system
the<00:05:01.470> entire<00:05:01.800> gimbal<00:05:02.250> you'll<00:05:02.730> see<00:05:02.940> is

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the entire gimbal you'll see is

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.240 
the entire gimbal you'll see is
completely<00:05:03.600> isolated<00:05:04.170> from<00:05:04.200> from<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.040> drone

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
completely isolated from from the drone

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.130 
completely isolated from from the drone
itself<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.850> depending<00:05:06.540> on<00:05:06.630> your<00:05:06.720> payload

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
itself and depending on your payload

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.360 
itself and depending on your payload
with<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.350> Maverick<00:05:07.680> obviously<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.190> have<00:05:08.340> a

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
with the Maverick obviously you have a

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.040 
with the Maverick obviously you have a
larger<00:05:08.700> cameras<00:05:09.000> larger<00:05:09.270> payload<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.870> can

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
larger cameras larger payload so you can

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.730 
larger cameras larger payload so you can
add<00:05:10.320> or<00:05:10.800> remove<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:12.150> vibration<00:05:12.690> dampers<00:05:13.140> so

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
add or remove the vibration dampers so

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.140 
add or remove the vibration dampers so
it's<00:05:13.890> completely<00:05:14.370> adjustable<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:15.060> can

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
it's completely adjustable you can

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.030 
it's completely adjustable you can
loosen<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:15.900> then<00:05:16.230> the<00:05:16.350> entire<00:05:16.560> rail<00:05:16.860> is

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
loosen that and then the entire rail is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.830 
loosen that and then the entire rail is
actually<00:05:17.370> able<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.030> slide<00:05:18.390> back<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.780> forth

gimbal<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.460> lot<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.670> people<00:05:29.850> have<00:05:29.940> asked<00:05:30.150> us

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
gimbal and a lot of people have asked us

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.240 
gimbal and a lot of people have asked us
why<00:05:30.420> we<00:05:30.450> are<00:05:30.660> needing<00:05:30.960> two<00:05:31.140> axes<00:05:31.500> obviously

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
why we are needing two axes obviously

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.250 
why we are needing two axes obviously
main<00:05:32.790> reason<00:05:33.120> is<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.570> get<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.840> see<00:05:33.990> all<00:05:34.110> your

main reason is you get to see all your
drone<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.830> third<00:05:35.010> axis

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
drone of the third axis

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.460 
drone of the third axis
instead<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.450> having<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.990> know<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:37.290> third

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
instead of having it you know the third

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.190 
instead of having it you know the third
X<00:05:37.650> is<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.800> complicated<00:05:38.460> controller<00:05:38.820> for<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.200> but

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
X is a complicated controller for it but

again<00:05:40.290> this<00:05:40.850> dampening<00:05:41.850> system<00:05:42.180> really<00:05:42.450> does

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
again this dampening system really does

again this dampening system really does
take<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.770> know<00:05:43.889> all<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.370> third<00:05:44.820> axis<00:05:45.210> wobble

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
take you know all that third axis wobble

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.360 
take you know all that third axis wobble
out<00:05:45.720> of<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.960> shot<00:05:46.200> which<00:05:46.470> makes<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.280> very

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
out of the shot which makes it very

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.000 
out of the shot which makes it very
simple<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:47.880> makes<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:49.470> know<00:05:49.560> easy<00:05:49.830> to

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
simple it makes it you know easy to

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.130 
simple it makes it you know easy to
