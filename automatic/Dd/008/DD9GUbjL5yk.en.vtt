00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
electronics the wheels who have we have

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.150 
electronics the wheels who have we have
been<00:00:32.610> given<00:00:32.810> almost<00:00:33.810> everything<00:00:34.380> budget<00:00:34.800> we

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.889 

you<00:01:12.479> design<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.899> control<00:01:13.229> system<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.940 

forward<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.539> backward<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.440> go<00:01:34.679> on<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
forward and backward is gonna go on the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.350 
forward and backward is gonna go on the
sides<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.649> less<00:01:37.830> than<00:01:38.039> hi<00:01:38.220> yes<00:01:38.729> now

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
sides you think less than hi yes now

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.279 
sides you think less than hi yes now
because<00:01:39.840> oh<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.569> no<00:01:42.600> direction<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
because oh you have no direction in

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.570 
because oh you have no direction in
there<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.250> tough<00:01:44.869> if<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:59.090 

collection<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:54.030> okay

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.080 
they sign to this competition they give
the<00:03:35.130> university<00:03:36.090> give<00:03:36.330> them<00:03:36.570> these<00:03:37.290> two<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the university give them these two I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.370 
the university give them these two I
think<00:03:39.090> that's<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.330> fantastic<00:03:39.420> idea<00:03:39.870> which<00:03:40.230> will

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
think that's a fantastic idea which will

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.780 
think that's a fantastic idea which will
do<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> same<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.950> doubt<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:43.310> point<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.580> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
do the same in doubt the point of the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.140 
do the same in doubt the point of the
Arab<00:03:44.940> Jana<00:03:45.209> alexina<00:03:45.900> yes<00:03:46.440> okay<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.880> works

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
Arab Jana alexina yes okay so it works

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.080 
Arab Jana alexina yes okay so it works
like<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> como<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.110> turn<00:03:49.350> because<00:03:49.920> before<00:03:50.760> you

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
like a como a turn because before you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.020 
like a como a turn because before you
use<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> car<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.100> charge<00:03:53.790> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
use it in the car you have to charge it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.970 
use it in the car you have to charge it
and<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.750> means<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.709> produce

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and it means you just that you produce

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.089 
and it means you just that you produce
by<00:03:56.370> electrolysis

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.520 

alright<00:04:01.099> then<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.790> put<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.569> car<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
alright then you put it in the car and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.290 
alright then you put it in the car and
it<00:04:03.650> runs<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.660> battery<00:04:05.959> actually

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
it runs so this is the battery actually

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.260 
it runs so this is the battery actually
to<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:09.019> just<00:04:09.290> pure<00:04:09.500> water

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
to you just pure water

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.590 
to you just pure water
when<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.780> plug<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.830> in<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.910> obesity

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
when you plug it in the obesity

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.420 
when you plug it in the obesity
the<00:04:16.600> oxygen<00:04:17.139> is<00:04:17.290> produced<00:04:17.650> by<00:04:17.709> la<00:04:17.949> Cruz's

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
the oxygen is produced by la Cruz's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.170 
the oxygen is produced by la Cruz's
house<00:04:19.410> somewhere<00:04:20.410> here<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:24.699> other<00:04:24.880> side

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
house somewhere here the other side

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.930 
house somewhere here the other side
design<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.840> yeah<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.350> was<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> coma<00:04:27.580> better

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
design and yeah I was in the coma better

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:46.250 
design and yeah I was in the coma better
come

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.320 

you
