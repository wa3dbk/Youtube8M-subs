00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:18.800
 Hello everyone, sports fans. I am Coach Nick. Welcome to Bball Breakdown. I was invited to the headquarters of NBA2K to find out the latest details of NBA 2K14. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, now we have the opportunity to see the inner essence and secrets of NBA 2K14. Very exciting! Come, are you ready? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Oh no, hey, I think I have to introduce you to some of the offensive tactics of the NBA 2K14. Sorry, I have already tried it. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Let us start with the setting of offensive tactics! Believe me, this is really amazing and amazing. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 At the beginning, I chose the horn attack tactics to match Nexus and Kobe. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.800
 This tactic eventually allowed Kobe to make singles, and Kobe's singles ability is how effective and stunning this tactic is. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 This time, the squadron implemented a dribble single file, which allowed Gordon to get the ball smoothly. Gordon pointed to Evans and then instantly scored the inside basket to play the Lakers defense. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 The Warriors offensive tactics now show the charm of the NBA 2K14. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Watching the doubles set up by David Lee and Bogut, let Klein Thompson run between them. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Phoenix is ​​still able to cling to Clay Thompson's defense, but they set up the same double-single, allowing Curry to drop long-distance two-pointers in front of Drach. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Look at this, the Spurs' tactics! Parker held the ball in the lone line, then Danny Green Z line running to get the ball. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 You can see that the other three players are ready to set a position for Parker, and Ray Allen is too far from Danny Green to make Danny throw a three-pointer, as if it were the finals. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 These tactics are built around the team and the individual players. This is the tactical setting of the Warriors, they have a lot of running tactics. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Now running Thompson's running tactics, Thompson passed the single set of David Lee, running behind him, coming to take over Couri's pass and then pitching. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 In slow motion, you can see that Thompson passed David Lee's singles and got rid of Bresso's defense. After Bresso and David Lee were in contact, they couldn't have time to defend Thompson's pitch. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Then very clever display. After Granger passed the ball, help Copland set a single file. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Copeland, who just joined the team, seems to have missed the opportunity to pitch. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 On the contrary, he passed the ball to the low-level Skola, and Skola showed his ability, turned and leaned back and scored. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Now let's take a look at the 96-year Bulls. You can see Langley running to form a demonstration of the Bulls' most famous triangle tactics. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Usually Jordan will stand in this low triangle position and go to the high position through a single file. The opponent should be wary of Langley, but did not notice that Jordan ran from the bottom line to the unguarded area. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Jordan easily pitched into the back and pitched the ball. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 But the computer is also good at running without the ball. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 You can see that George passed the ball and Prince rushed to defend the West. After Prince lost his position, Stephenson's quick floor pass allowed George to quickly score a slam dunk. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 The Suns allowed Butler to implement two singles. This tactic was implemented very quickly, and even Thompson did not notice the vacant Dracic, let him cast three points. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 It is now necessary to know how to use these offensive tactics. Because the NBA 2K14's defensive ability is further improved. You can't easily pass the ball to the low post. This is like a real basketball exercise. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 The NBA 2K14 won't score very easily. The improvement in defense proves everything. A lot of offense touches, but no foul will make the ball difficult to enter. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Just like real life, you can't pass the backcourt directly to the players in the frontcourt without mistakes, just like Kobe and Nai Xu can't get it. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 In particular, when you make a mistake, you can clearly see the expression of your teammates, just like the helplessness of Gesso. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Gesso has a lot of expressions, like this, when he was not fouled by Howard, he would strongly protest. This will make us look forward to the Lakers and the Rockets. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 This is a good pick-and-roll match for the Grizzlies, but the improvement in AI's defensive ability has caused Davis to miss the ball. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 The NBA 2K14's offensive tactics are important because collisions with defenders without fouls can affect the chances of the ball entering. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 As in real life, you must pay attention to the teammate's position when you dribble. You may collide with your teammates and lose the ball. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And you can also see some very special passing methods in NBA 2K14. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, you can see how cool the offensive tactics are, and you can make a lot of incredible and interesting things. The improvement in defensive ability has forced us to pay attention to the importance of offensive tactics. This is like the basketball in our real life. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.000
