00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 notice that this weekend we have 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 a very important match and aside 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.790
 absolutely away the idea of winning 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.650
 the championship mathematically looks very 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 difficult to face a team that does 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.130
 still mathematically have some kind 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 of scopes as is the team of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.090
 sports iquique carlos efraín kills 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 wants your evaluation of this duel of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 this party that had everything to everyone 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.449
 lost criminals did not have all this 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 commitment yes and I would like to make the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.970
 even what I could rescue the most is that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 regained the joy to play because 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 with the injection of the two players 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.690
 young as a carmon and as days the u 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
 had an interesting change so much so that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 it was relatively easy for 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 beat the box for what it considers 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 another thing the whole party a little while in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.940
 the first time when the key he made 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 the goal is going to take with the first goal that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.390
 the voice was lost a little but after 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.489
 he recovered quickly it was so easy the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.859
 victory of the victim diego bravo 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.570
 I believe that don carlos efrain kills these 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.690
 minutes you 're wrong you're making a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.690
 analysis 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.990
 stop the music 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.390
 by saying that winning was easy was not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.500
 easy you wrong, don carlos or the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 match 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.670
 well if I have to recognize that the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 Youth at the University of Chile 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.110
 boat made the difference as well as 10 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.110
 minutes but and still 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.080
 why 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 and I had an inspired montage that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.330
 it was after we got tired I think that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 the change of more I had already exercised 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.470
 before any one more vertical player 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 a more aggressive playing in fact he to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 through it was that you get the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 criminal but it is the crucial moment the subject 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.310
 of the criminal that loses villalobos I believe 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.570
 that the crucial moment was when when 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.160
 we could not convert which yes 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.590
 we had many goal options that did not 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.900
 we converted and the Bull took advantage of those 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.420
 two nights now after the criminal already 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.100
 clearly not forced to go look for the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.140
 tie again and that generated spaces 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.060
 so that later he turned this one that did not 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.500
 he deserved it in the mates that you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.550
 says that he still regained the joy for 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 to play 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.000
 and all that so now also that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.980
 also that this time the 'u' 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.209
 also played with joy because there 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.770
 you have the pressure to be thinking 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.190
 the first places like that already delivered 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.110
 the championship if there might be 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.910
 happened that of course but what 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 important is something that I most rescue the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 daring of our technician cristian 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 rosemary that I congratulate you for daring 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 to place two young players 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.440
 so important that in the end they were 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.480
 chosen as a best match game 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 fabio in carbon is indeed waiting 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.520
 here to be the best date play 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.340
 and the boy Guillermo Díaz 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.380
 and a very interesting side or side 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.150
 that with a lot of projection players that 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.220
 dare to dare to spend a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 player and that is try to touch the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.130
 Little ball to get to the bullfight 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.270
 Now, what is he going to do? 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.890
 we have not won any of the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.330
 called big with colo colo objective 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.560
 with catholic we lost and now with the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.310
 University of Chile that you are very 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.310
 little girls jaime 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.459
 yes 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:50.780
 has no stadium is the most important thing
