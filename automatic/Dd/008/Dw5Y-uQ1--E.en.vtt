this<00:00:23.990> is<00:00:25.010> probably<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.279> thinnest<00:00:26.730> I've<00:00:26.910> ever

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
this is probably the thinnest I've ever

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.319 
this is probably the thinnest I've ever
seen<00:00:29.240> when<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.510> building<00:00:30.900> them<00:00:31.050> racers

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
seen when I was building them racers

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.360 
seen when I was building them racers
okay<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:37.579> layer<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.969> six<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
okay we was using up a layer of six a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.799 
okay we was using up a layer of six a
layer<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> two<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> layer<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> six<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.640> believe

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
layer a two and a layer of six I believe

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
layer a two and a layer of six I believe
you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:53.930> that's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you know and that's going to be that's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.160 
you know and that's going to be that's
how<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.949> know<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> thing's<00:00:56.489> gonna<00:00:56.699> fly<00:00:57.170> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
how you know this thing's gonna fly in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
how you know this thing's gonna fly in
the<00:00:58.289> low<00:00:58.469> 20s<00:00:59.210> with<00:01:00.210> no<00:01:00.390> cockpit<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.260> ain't

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the low 20s with no cockpit I ain't

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.200 
the low 20s with no cockpit I ain't
gonna<00:01:01.620> put<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> confident<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.699> away<00:01:02.910> I'm

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
gonna put a confident right away I'm

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
gonna put a confident right away I'm
just<00:01:03.390> gonna<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> dude<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> I'll<00:01:08.490> put

just gonna put a dude and and I'll put
an<00:01:08.820> air<00:01:09.229> for<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.350> thing<00:01:10.560> stand<00:01:10.920> man<00:01:11.600> I'm

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
an air for this thing stand man I'm

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.670 
an air for this thing stand man I'm
gonna<00:01:12.780> say<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.939> layer<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.960> layer<00:01:16.200> six

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.760 

probably<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.760> is<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.050> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
probably all that is but you can go and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
probably all that is but you can go and
then<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:22.980> like<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.760> layers<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.150> six<00:01:24.510> up<00:01:24.690> front

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
then put like two layers of six up front

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
then put like two layers of six up front
now<00:01:25.650> they're<00:01:25.890> getting<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
now they're getting away with it it's a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
now they're getting away with it it's a
carbon<00:01:33.120> toe<00:01:34.550> saying<00:01:35.550> they<00:01:35.760> got<00:01:36.590> parven<00:01:37.590> toe

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
carbon toe saying they got parven toe

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060 
carbon toe saying they got parven toe

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
challenge to this model is modeling is

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
challenge to this model is modeling is
paint<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.959> build<00:02:46.260> heavy<00:02:46.530> airplane<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.250> takes

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
paint like build heavy airplane it takes

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.250 
paint like build heavy airplane it takes
a<00:02:47.580> good<00:02:47.730> modeler<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.360> build<00:02:48.570> them<00:02:48.690> light<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
a good modeler to build them light and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.670 
a good modeler to build them light and
that's<00:02:50.100> what's<00:02:50.430> got<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.790> your<00:02:51.060> key<00:02:51.680> seeing

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that's what's got to be your key seeing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.479 
that's what's got to be your key seeing
also<00:02:53.989> I'm<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.320> putting<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> servos<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
also I'm not putting the servos in the

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.870 
also I'm not putting the servos in the
tail<00:02:57.950> I'm<00:02:58.950> gonna<00:02:59.130> keep<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.459> weight<00:02:59.640> out<00:02:59.820> of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
tail I'm gonna keep the weight out of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.729 
tail I'm gonna keep the weight out of
the<00:02:59.970> tail<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.510> ain't<00:03:00.660> gonna<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.380> add<00:03:01.500> no

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
the tail so I ain't gonna have to add no

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.810 
the tail so I ain't gonna have to add no
lead<00:03:02.010> there's<00:03:03.000> where<00:03:03.299> my<00:03:03.329> servos<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.110> going

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
lead there's where my servos are going

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.870 
lead there's where my servos are going
then<00:03:05.820> I'm<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.180> gonna<00:03:06.390> run<00:03:06.630> straight<00:03:06.780> wire

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
then I'm just gonna run straight wire

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.420 
then I'm just gonna run straight wire
like<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.150> top<00:03:09.450> flight<00:03:09.660> p-51s<00:03:10.440> guys<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.250> my

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
like the top flight p-51s guys I had my

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.900 
like the top flight p-51s guys I had my
zvz<00:03:11.880> 80<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:12.630> there<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.280> flew<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.549> thing<00:03:14.760> was

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
zvz 80 in there and flew that thing was

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.080 
zvz 80 in there and flew that thing was
right<00:03:15.090> art<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.510> 160<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.500> flew<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.489> for<00:03:17.700> years

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
right art at 160 and flew it for years

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.690 
right art at 160 and flew it for years
and<00:03:18.500> never<00:03:19.500> had<00:03:19.769> no<00:03:19.980> trouble<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.579> that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
and never had no trouble out of that

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.840 
and never had no trouble out of that
solid<00:03:21.120> wire<00:03:21.299> shut<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.200> got<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.370> piece<00:03:23.820> of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
solid wire shut up I got this piece of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.840 
solid wire shut up I got this piece of
wood<00:03:24.120> glass<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.340> ain't<00:03:26.579> going

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
wood glass in there and then ain't going

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
wood glass in there and then ain't going
nowhere<00:03:27.230> right<00:03:28.230> there<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:30.079> carbon<00:03:31.079> toe

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
they had men they had a bunch of servos

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.899 
they had men they had a bunch of servos
back<00:03:40.829> here<00:03:41.069> they<00:03:41.879> had<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:43.439> stirring<00:03:44.129> denote

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
back here they had the stirring denote

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.420

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the tail wheel steering servo went back

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.929 
the tail wheel steering servo went back
here

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939

here
-<00:03:48.629> elevator<00:03:49.019> servos<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:51.349> think<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:52.739> was

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
- elevator servos I think this one was

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.530 
- elevator servos I think this one was
supposed<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.310> work<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.640> rudder<00:03:53.849> -<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.420> I'm

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
supposed to work the rudder - but I'm

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.130 
supposed to work the rudder - but I'm
just<00:03:54.599> gonna<00:03:54.930> put<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> pull<00:03:55.560> pull<00:03:55.860> on<00:03:56.129> my<00:03:56.340> rudder

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
just gonna put a pull pull on my rudder

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.990 
just gonna put a pull pull on my rudder
and<00:03:59.299> pull<00:04:00.299> pull<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.250> tail<00:04:02.519> wheel<00:04:03.349> and<00:04:05.000> then

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
and pull pull to the tail wheel and then

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.729 
and pull pull to the tail wheel and then
go<00:04:06.120> ahead<00:04:06.269> no<00:04:06.420> sort<00:04:06.659> of<00:04:06.720> goes<00:04:06.840> back<00:04:07.049> there<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
go ahead no sort of goes back there and

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.970 
go ahead no sort of goes back there and
cuz<00:04:08.579> man<00:04:08.909> three<00:04:09.629> servos<00:04:10.170> back<00:04:10.470> there<00:04:10.680> plus<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
cuz man three servos back there plus the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.800 
cuz man three servos back there plus the
wood<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.579> that<00:04:11.730> bulkhead<00:04:12.150> they<00:04:12.359> had<00:04:12.629> and<00:04:13.049> and

wood of that bulkhead they had and and
the<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.199> elevators<00:04:16.739> are<00:04:16.949> like<00:04:17.160> this

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the out of the elevators are like this

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.430 
the out of the elevators are like this
tubes<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:18.660> you're<00:04:18.840> supposed<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.169> mount

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.159 
tubes and then you're supposed to mount
a<00:04:19.530> servo<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.160> there<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.609> what<00:04:21.449> time<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.840> go<00:04:21.989> do

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
a servo in there and what time you go do

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.750 
a servo in there and what time you go do
that<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.440> glue<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.770> piece<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.160> wood<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
so you put on my servos under there and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.029 
so you put on my servos under there and
they're<00:04:30.780> gonna<00:04:30.870> be<00:04:30.990> just<00:04:31.199> fine<00:04:31.380> then<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.860> can
