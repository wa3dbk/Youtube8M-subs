00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.620
 hello guys and welcome back to the canal 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.629
 aaron manager today wanted to talk to you about that 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.700
 an application for the iPhone I use 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.230
 to record my progress in 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.200
 gym is called g 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.240
 coach and can be downloaded on itunes 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.940
 the interface is very simple 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.200
 there are also exists the 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.510
 possibility to register your own 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.000
 measures also at a visual level with the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.220
 pictures on some lent calculator 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.970
 a network but it is first there is also a 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.039
 catalog of the various exercises by district 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 muscle with even an animation that 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.360
 give the opportunity to see the exercise 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.970
 of the perfect execution also 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.460
 option rankings for multi exercises 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.989
 joint or isolation we take for 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.410
 example in exercise for shoulders like 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.410
 raise the animation to arnold 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.690
 therefore the possibility of seeing also 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.540
 the exercise before the session in 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.070
 gym but the main reason for the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.380
 which I downloaded this application e 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.000
 because it allows me to register mine 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.920
 routine this for example that of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 November December with an aspect i 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.659
 four days to record all 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.079
 exercises per training day e 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.159
 therefore also every week record i 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.439
 my progress 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.189
 this is the routine of now with 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.639
 five days of training per week 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.799
 then if we look at the history key then 

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:25.009
 chronological order of training 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.719
 in January it is also possible 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.130
 go back to see for example i 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.649
 the icons of December November also 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.740
 of the running domain shows one 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.200
 cardio session instead of the handlebar 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.389
 showing a weight training 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 also the possibility to see how many 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.919
 sometimes trained a muscle district at 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.359
 month based on the trends you have 

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:52.159
 done and then also the possibility of 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.479
 have sum of each workout 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.789
 this for example one of the last 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.739
 in the mind of the legs I did with 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.539
 all the series also of the rest if 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.049
 you want a bride from one set to another 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.669
 all recorded in pliche shaun 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.940
 if you want you can also see a 

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:15.330
 increase a deck not a drop 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.340
 the king max but this honestly does not me 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.340
 interested because I train for that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 for too many and in the tours there is the possibility 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.600
 to backup 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.690
 every time you save your workout 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.030
 but we create a new routine so there 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.230
 for example, let's say a three-day split 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.960
 an intermediate and then routine 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.370
 we begin to name each day 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.020
 for the muscle group we come from 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.630
 first day we do chest and triceps 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.510
 very simply I go to insert then 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.290
 exercises for these districts 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.640
 muscle 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.910
 so I choose from a very extensive list 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:05.610
 of exercises for the chest here is a little 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.290
 of cross cables and then in the application 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.630
 it also gives me the possibility to insert 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.270
 the set number is the number of 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.120
 repetitions as well as also answered the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.750
 repetition other then here for example 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.350
 could see we add a set then we put 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.550
 that the last set of 5 repetitions is here 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.350
 this will not change even at rest 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.739
 we leave another minute to exercise 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.910
 these are the parallels we add a 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.540
 other 22 sets and we increase for example the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.540
 respons 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.830
 the application then also gives the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.410
 possibility wanting to insert a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.720
 superset not always easy precisely in the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.220
 fiction find this option 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.989
 so for example to a superset for the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.790
 chest with the triceps we want to choose 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.890
 a critical video exercise the one chosen 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.410
 for the chest 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.560
 here we are and we have this then 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.230
 brace shows that this is a is a 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.540
 superset you will also see when is the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
 time to record progress as 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.609
 be shown exactly as a 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.469
 superset let's see for example how 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.419
 record progress in clear why 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.780
 we know we're in the gym 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.360
 we start a trend of the pet triceps 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.879
 well here we insert immediately for example the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.389
 weight not used for the first 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:36.250
 first set the second third 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.979
 automatically you see that it also calculates 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.479
 the one re max because interested point 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.319
 develop the door 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.789
 same thing for the second exercise 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.520
 how we put the weight 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.810
 we used to do these 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.039
 repeated and so on, you have understood 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.169
 a moment the how it works is then finished 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.210
 training and we make backups e 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.889
 we save on the server so they were greetings 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.110
 neither saved and I wanted to stay there, here is the 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.889
 then report this workout and 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.460
 we did the last thing I wanted 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.909
 show routine pina point appears 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.039
 in the system the last set is the last thing 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.349
 I wanted to show you in a routine 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.360
 already done as you can see which ones 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.449
 have been progress and see what they are 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.039
 been let's say weights done at the time 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.830
 previous that these are the four 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.279
 weeks before the strange of mine 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.020
 workout so let me know what you 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:38.199
 think i advise that i am why 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.479
 scene strongly and then next time 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.370
 maybe I'll even talk to you there as a calculation 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.009
 my macros and which types of 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.469
 application this case ex to the file 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.870
