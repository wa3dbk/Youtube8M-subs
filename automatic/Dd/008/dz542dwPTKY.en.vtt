00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.779 

we<00:00:52.600> looked<00:00:52.870> at<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.289> zombie<00:00:53.680> genre<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:54.609> the

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
we looked at the zombie genre that the

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.630 
we looked at the zombie genre that the
throat<00:00:55.210> zombie<00:00:55.809> genre<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.559> we<00:00:57.100> know<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.489> have

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
throat zombie genre and we know we have

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.430 
throat zombie genre and we know we have
our<00:00:57.670> own<00:00:57.820> successes<00:00:58.600> there<00:00:58.840> with<00:00:59.079> Dead<00:00:59.260> Island

our own successes there with Dead Island

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.979 
our own successes there with Dead Island
which<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.219> still<00:01:00.489> selling<00:01:00.879> great<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:01.719> we<00:01:01.870> were

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
which is still selling great but we were

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.710 
which is still selling great but we were
thinking<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.160> missing<00:01:04.000> in<00:01:04.240> the<00:01:04.510> whole

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
thinking what was missing in the whole

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.780 
thinking what was missing in the whole
genre<00:01:04.750> what<00:01:05.290> we<00:01:05.440> could<00:01:05.620> add<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
genre what we could add and the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.520 
genre what we could add and the
freerunning<00:01:07.540> was<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.900> natural<00:01:08.350> answer

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
freerunning was the natural answer

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.400 
freerunning was the natural answer
because<00:01:09.100> humans<00:01:09.850> should<00:01:10.120> be<00:01:10.300> able<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.660> move<00:01:10.960> in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
because humans should be able to move in

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.340 
because humans should be able to move in
ways<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:12.070> zombies<00:01:12.550> most<00:01:12.850> zombies<00:01:13.120> pants<00:01:13.630> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
ways that zombies most zombies pants and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.590 
ways that zombies most zombies pants and
if<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:14.860> get<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.100> great<00:01:15.580> open<00:01:16.060> world<00:01:16.240> which

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
if you get a great open world which

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.350 
if you get a great open world which
players<00:01:16.930> love<00:01:17.350> we<00:01:17.620> know<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:18.010> they<00:01:18.880> should<00:01:19.180> be

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
players love we know that they should be

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.590 
players love we know that they should be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
able to fully like explore it to look

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.080 
able to fully like explore it to look
for<00:01:22.870> resources<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.500> use<00:01:24.190> whatever<00:01:24.700> they<00:01:25.060> can

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
for resources to use whatever they can

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.120 
for resources to use whatever they can
