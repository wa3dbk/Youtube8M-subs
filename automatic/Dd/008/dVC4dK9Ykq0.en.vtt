sony e-mount 51 point i OS s and that's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.310 
sony e-mount 51 point i OS s and that's
for<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.570> Sony<00:00:21.869> NEX<00:00:22.320> 6<00:00:23.060> now<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:25.109> first

interesting<00:00:25.619> point<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
interesting point to know on this is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
interesting point to know on this is
that<00:00:27.509> it's<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.810> image<00:00:28.050> stabilized<00:00:28.560> lens<00:00:28.679> but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that it's an image stabilized lens but

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.810 
that it's an image stabilized lens but
it's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.759> prime<00:00:30.019> 51<00:00:31.019> 8<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.250> don't<00:00:32.310> know<00:00:32.610> if

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's a prime 51 8 and I don't know if

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's a prime 51 8 and I don't know if
many<00:00:33.060> other<00:00:33.240> lenses<00:00:34.370> mmm<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
many other lenses mmm if you think of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
many other lenses mmm if you think of
all<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> Nick<00:00:36.450> Hans<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.800> believe<00:00:38.070> any

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
all the Nick Hans I don't believe any

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.000 
all the Nick Hans I don't believe any
other<00:00:38.460> primes<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.149> image<00:00:39.690> stabilized<00:00:40.200> so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
other primes are image stabilized so

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
other primes are image stabilized so
that<00:00:41.039> is<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.879> interest<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.300> me<00:00:43.610> we<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> quick

glass sony seem to have some very
strange<00:01:46.610> sizes<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.909> their<00:01:48.030> filters<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
strange sizes for their filters this is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
strange sizes for their filters this is
a<00:01:48.689> 49<00:01:49.110> mil<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.850> OS<00:01:53.420> 35<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.590> 16<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.070> 15<00:01:56.219> lens

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
a 49 mil the OS 35 was it 16 to 15 lens

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.170 
a 49 mil the OS 35 was it 16 to 15 lens
is<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> 40<00:01:58.829> point<00:01:59.040> 5<00:01:59.369> mil<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.030> there's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
is a like a 40 point 5 mil so there's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.700 
is a like a 40 point 5 mil so there's
some<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.509> weird<00:02:00.659> sizes<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.560> my

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
some really weird sizes so I just my

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
some really weird sizes so I just my
step-up<00:02:02.070> rings<00:02:02.100> 252<00:02:02.909> mil<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
step-up rings 252 mil which is like a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
step-up rings 252 mil which is like a
standard<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.039> filter<00:02:05.369> sizes

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
standard and that's the filter sizes

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.510 
standard and that's the filter sizes
I've<00:02:05.909> got<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.660> focus<00:02:09.660> ring<00:02:09.869> feels<00:02:10.520> really

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I've got so the focus ring feels really

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.619 
I've got so the focus ring feels really
nice

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
nice

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.660 
nice
doesn't<00:02:13.530> make<00:02:13.709> any<00:02:13.769> more<00:02:14.099> beliefs<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.549> this

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
doesn't make any more beliefs and this

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.229 
doesn't make any more beliefs and this
is<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.209> Cygnus<00:02:15.810> do<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.670> if<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:18.000> pop

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
is like the Cygnus do so if we just pop

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.330 
is like the Cygnus do so if we just pop
that<00:02:18.269> onto<00:02:21.200> camera<00:02:22.200> okay<00:02:22.859> so<00:02:22.920> there<00:02:23.129> we<00:02:23.159> have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that onto camera okay so there we have

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
that onto camera okay so there we have
it<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> NEX<00:02:24.000> six<00:02:25.099> looks<00:02:26.099> nice<00:02:27.260> feels<00:02:28.260> nice

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
it on the NEX six looks nice feels nice

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.619 
it on the NEX six looks nice feels nice
in<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.920> hand<00:02:32.930> start-up<00:02:33.930> time<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.379> with<00:02:35.069> all<00:02:35.939> it

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
in the hand start-up time as with all it

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.479 
in the hand start-up time as with all it
seems<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.049> most<00:02:37.319> lenses<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.920> NEX<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.459> a

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
seems with most lenses on the NEX is a

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.099 
seems with most lenses on the NEX is a
touch<00:02:38.879> on<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> slow<00:02:39.389> side<00:02:39.599> certainly

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
touch on the slow side certainly

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.589 
touch on the slow side certainly
compared<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.829> other<00:02:41.030> Panasonic<00:02:42.030> GX<00:02:42.389> one

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
compared to the other Panasonic GX one

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.059 
compared to the other Panasonic GX one
that<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:42.900> used<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.700> using<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.290> first

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
that I'm used to using now the first

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.800 
that I'm used to using now the first
thing<00:02:47.159> I'll<00:02:47.280> say<00:02:47.310> about<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.730> lens<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.269> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
thing I'll say about this lens and the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.740 
thing I'll say about this lens and the
same<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.560> 55<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.280> 210<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.689> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
same is the 55 to 210 is that the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.490 
same is the 55 to 210 is that the
autofocus

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
autofocus

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920 
autofocus
is<00:02:52.709> certainly<00:02:53.159> not<00:02:53.370> quick<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.599> not

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
is certainly not quick it's not

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.599 
is certainly not quick it's not
horrendously<00:02:55.829> slow<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.849> in<00:02:57.859> C<00:02:58.859> I'm<00:02:59.370> gonna

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
horrendously slow but in C I'm gonna

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.199 
horrendously slow but in C I'm gonna
start<00:03:00.060> I'll<00:03:00.510> focus<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.379> keyboard<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:03.120> you

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
start I'll focus on the keyboard and you

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.349 
start I'll focus on the keyboard and you
can<00:03:03.450> hear<00:03:03.629> them<00:03:04.609> you<00:03:05.609> hear<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.879> bleep<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> I'm

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
can hear them you hear the bleep so I'm

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.839 
can hear them you hear the bleep so I'm
gonna<00:03:09.450> focus<00:03:09.689> over<00:03:09.959> there<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.230> window

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
gonna focus over there on the window

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.539 
gonna focus over there on the window
press<00:03:11.849> in<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:13.109> it's<00:03:13.290> got<00:03:13.379> it<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.159> as<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.430> can

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
press in and it's got it so as you can

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.339 
press in and it's got it so as you can
see<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.150> quite<00:03:15.450> slow<00:03:15.689> especially<00:03:15.870> in

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
see it is quite slow especially in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.699 
see it is quite slow especially in
fairly<00:03:16.919> poor<00:03:17.159> lighting<00:03:17.370> conditions<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.590> it

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
fairly poor lighting conditions and it

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.289 
fairly poor lighting conditions and it
does<00:03:19.859> seem<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.190> hunt<00:03:20.370> around<00:03:20.699> a<00:03:20.849> little<00:03:20.970> bit<00:03:21.180> as

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
does seem to hunt around a little bit as

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.960 
does seem to hunt around a little bit as
well<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.479> have<00:03:21.690> used<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.079> mins<00:03:22.699> and<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:23.790> will

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
well I have used this mins and I will

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.729 
well I have used this mins and I will
throttle<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> couple<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.229> pictures<00:03:25.409> at

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
throttle it just a couple of pictures at

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.670 
throttle it just a couple of pictures at
the<00:03:25.829> end<00:03:25.859> I've<00:03:26.220> taken<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> yeah<00:03:28.139> don't<00:03:28.319> expect

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the end I've taken so yeah don't expect

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.770 
the end I've taken so yeah don't expect
a<00:03:28.769> super<00:03:29.040> fast<00:03:29.250> snappy<00:03:29.579> autofocus<00:03:30.479> and<00:03:30.629> it's

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
a super fast snappy autofocus and it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.539 
a super fast snappy autofocus and it's
certainly<00:03:31.079> what<00:03:31.290> not<00:03:31.500> what<00:03:31.680> I'm<00:03:31.739> used<00:03:31.949> to<00:03:32.099> with

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
certainly what not what I'm used to with

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.780 
certainly what not what I'm used to with
the<00:03:32.760> Nick<00:03:32.909> Hans<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> bit<00:03:35.669> of<00:03:35.729> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the Nick Hans so that is a bit of a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.670 
the Nick Hans so that is a bit of a
compromise<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.840> does<00:03:37.019> seem<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
compromise but that does seem to be the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.199 
compromise but that does seem to be the
way<00:03:37.799> with<00:03:38.099> this<00:03:38.280> system<00:03:38.790> however<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.540> am

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
way with this system however I am

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.059 
way with this system however I am
prepared<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.470> not<00:03:43.620> really<00:03:43.889> an

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
prepared for that and it's not really an

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.830 
prepared for that and it's not really an
issue<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.519> me<00:03:44.729> and<00:03:44.909> certainly<00:03:45.329> not<00:03:45.569> with<00:03:45.720> this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
issue for me and certainly not with this

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.689 
issue for me and certainly not with this
lens<00:03:46.729> the<00:03:47.729> image<00:03:48.349> stabilisation<00:03:49.349> it's<00:03:50.129> just<00:03:50.400> a

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
lens the image stabilisation it's just a

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.920 
lens the image stabilisation it's just a
little<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.819> know<00:03:53.849> seems<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.329> work<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.540> well

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
little you know seems to work very well

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.839 
little you know seems to work very well
very<00:03:55.530> nice<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.639> stable<00:03:57.229> so<00:03:58.310> initial<00:03:59.310> first

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
very nice and stable so initial first

very nice and stable so initial first
initial<00:04:00.180> impressions<00:04:00.659> are<00:04:00.959> I'm<00:04:01.439> really<00:04:02.099> happy

1.8 the pictures I've seen so far is it

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.270 
1.8 the pictures I've seen so far is it
super<00:04:10.049> sharp<00:04:10.319> or<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.040> way<00:04:11.129> across<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
super sharp or all the way across the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.759 
super sharp or all the way across the
screen<00:04:14.280> right<00:04:14.549> up<00:04:14.729> to<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.939> edges<00:04:15.769> especially

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
screen right up to the edges especially

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.680 
screen right up to the edges especially
when<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.009> stop<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.340> down<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.849> I<00:04:18.180> mean<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.509> go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
when you stop it down to I mean you go

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.789 
when you stop it down to I mean you go
to<00:04:18.720> f/4<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:20.070> insanely<00:04:20.609> sharp<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.359> my<00:04:21.389> P

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
to f/4 is it's insanely sharp in my P

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.670 
to f/4 is it's insanely sharp in my P
but<00:04:22.490> anything<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.900> mean<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.139> one<00:04:24.349> point<00:04:24.500> ie

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
but anything so I mean in one point ie

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.279 
but anything so I mean in one point ie
sharp<00:04:25.099> but<00:04:25.729> it<00:04:26.030> gets<00:04:26.240> sharper<00:04:26.690> as<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> goes<00:04:27.080> to

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
sharp but it gets sharper as it goes to

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.080 
sharp but it gets sharper as it goes to
so<00:04:27.440> therefore<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:28.220> then<00:04:28.490> when<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.759> gets<00:04:28.879> light

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
so therefore and then when it gets light

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.140 
so therefore and then when it gets light
if<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.360> eat<00:04:29.479> or<00:04:29.599> tone<00:04:29.840> off<00:04:29.990> again<00:04:30.319> but<00:04:31.280> overall

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
if I eat or tone off again but overall

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.089 
if I eat or tone off again but overall
I'm<00:04:32.509> really<00:04:32.569> happy<00:04:33.020> with<00:04:33.229> that<00:04:33.259> for<00:04:33.889> what<00:04:34.009> is

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
I'm really happy with that for what is

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.700 
I'm really happy with that for what is
essentially<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.879> know<00:04:35.000> just<00:04:35.900> over<00:04:36.020> 100<00:04:36.530> quid

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
essentially you know just over 100 quid
