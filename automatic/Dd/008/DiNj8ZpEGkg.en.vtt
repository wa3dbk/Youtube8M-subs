00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello and welcome to what 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.069
 Go on da rainha in today's episode 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.130
 it's about how to pillar such 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 gets on a slope like that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.759
 At the family home is safe here 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.049
 on the website 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 and yes I will you this time 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.430
 Just show with fire this house 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 on how it is structured and this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.109
 Although there we have this area here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.130
 you are marked and then 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 we have here on the other side 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.439
 even these columns visually pillar the house 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 and keep in play here as well 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.559
 and yes the house is really real 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.930
 pretty her case is never noticed 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.399
 So of the type with garage and then 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.410
 here are in the way over is single case 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 cool idea maybe i need too 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 such a house just a little adapted 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.629
 and he so parted in the hoard 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.300
 but okay yes I would say we see 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 We'll be back soon when I see the house 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.219
 demolished and yes then I show 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.100
 you own that is the best we do 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.690
 are now back and that the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 franks best with the flat bottom 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 not bad if he was 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 would be present 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.100
 like over there with the family 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.090
 feature there you go easy on that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.530
 do terrain and then on terrain 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 straighten you get this here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 beautiful green plate is sometimes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.630
 she also bread that you could have it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 to start the road 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.189
 keep the left mouse button pressed and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 just pull the plates long so far 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 we want to have a straight bottom and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 let's just go then adapts the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.700
 floor completely on the entire track 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280
 the first place 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.630
 the first placed plate in the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.950
 the case of the road and thereby 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.430
 Do you get this beautiful straight? 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.990
 ground 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.909
 that could also be arbitrary far 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 pull to the abyss to the abyss can 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.700
 Incidentally, you also manage yourself 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.590
 with all these tools you can 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.350
 because here so up and down and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.100
 customize and whatever that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.539
 have and yes to our straight bottom 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.390
 here is quite handy if 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.429
 We want to place a staircase 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.259
 the foundations are still here 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.969
 we find here below for those who it 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.649
 do not know 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.539
 and yes, then we take this foundation 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.909
 and not just as in straightening 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.039
 Press the left mouse button on the bottom 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.450
 hold and just pull so far 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.430
 we should reach the foundation 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.950
 and you can already see the foundation fits 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.599
 It will simply be on the ground 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.069
 accordingly larger or too 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.709
 I'll just let it go 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.720
 So it is extremely high and here it is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.310
 lower 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.459
 through the area who would have through the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.840
 area we have so and yes that leaves 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.640
 also with all other things 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.349
 continue to expand as if it were after her 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.790
 pull that adapts and if we do 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.630
 which now cover even after 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.090
 adapts to that 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.560
 that's no problem at all and so too 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.420
 if we put that in the middle 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.519
 it is no longer so it so it 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.380
 always here so directly on the plate 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.090
 go out what moves us 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 height and that will not be like that again 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.260
 practically 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.000
 unless you just have it for one 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 flat surface in the house would be that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.970
 a bit so yes but for example here 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.890
 with the stairs if you have that 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.540
 then you can just like that here 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.760
 a staircase fast and for it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.870
 place and that's no 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.700
 problem more 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 that was just what made it possible 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.170
 turn and then it's fine and you have already 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.690
 your house but he wanted a house 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.790
 on pillars and you get about as 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.930
 search here and indeed goes back to that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.400
 account at duckfoot and yes there are only 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.230
 the control button on your keyboard 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.970
 that's the ctrl key and that presses 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.920
 you and finally let go of everything else 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.270
 the left mouse button clicked while hers 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.890
 the control button presses and sees it 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.170
 just get rid of it then put out the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.090
 whole things and could with 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.740
 unique columns create that 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.700
 Now just what did you look in 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.540
 which direction is right now was 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.600
 the wrong direction 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.970
 that was too much that was too much yes 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.840
 that's good , just do it 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.580
 away then no problem me 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.780
 Computer control like yourself 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.370
 Children had to start right now 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.320
 it should actually be the round as well 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.110
 it will be gone once again that was 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.330
 To sit too much that is not so 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.920
 easy but if you first the bow 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.810
 Out then you can do that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.350
 Of course, they should also be arbitrarily small 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.810
 or make it big 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.220
 but somehow moment you have to a 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.959
 Do a little bit of other things now 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.060
 it's better and easy 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.280
 Take it away if you want fruit 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.120
 or not, but also simple 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520
 you guys are just anybody 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.410
 Suggestion hammer tool and could too 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.660
 just something left out or something 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.100
 pull it right away and delete it 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.100
 is also quite easy because you have the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.300
 do not press the control button 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.100
 yes you can just make it like that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.960
 you want and then you can also for 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.490
 for example, such beautiful bridges easy 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.419
 cover so that the column is also a 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.430
 winner 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.520
 Just go over here and do it 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.340
 after that again 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.849
 the net is also built up but 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.430
 can you easily around it 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:05:00.680
 pull the wall and actually too 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.650
 already I am completing this now 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.120
 just so you see that yes and the 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.860
 I already have the size of the pillar 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.090
 you can just tell it to adapt 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.129
 you become as thin as at 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.139
 the features and here below in 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.530
 could insert a pool or something 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.330
 always 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.979
 if you, for example, the area 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.389
 could use like the terrain tool 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.860
 and just plain with it 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.630
 below a nice flat area 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.880
 Gets good once it was a bit 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.949
 bigger so and so it does not quite like that 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.139
 stupid looks like this on this 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.650
 Terrain now straighten moment 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.060
 Smooth on terrain and take on 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.080
 best the middle level i think and 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.669
 then that could just happen 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.710
 adjust a bit by putting this in 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.090
 pulls a bit long and then it falls 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.490
 barely there and there is a level in it 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.620
 yes, we just fit into the 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.479
 landscape and yes as the most beautiful one 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.880
 very good solution for individual homes 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.159
 to build 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.289
 and yes so much 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.030
 but now the roof in this mess 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.960
 from and I think I'm hanging right now 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.490
 the roof tool with ran and bring that 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.930
 right after a separate episode 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.969
 because I have quite a few topics from 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.830
 get you and after today easy 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.500
 Two follow what's going on in there 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.120
 So have fun with the profi but only too 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.800
 a new tool and i hope so 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.660
 could help you write yours 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.830
 feedback easily in the comments and 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.880
 we'll see each other next 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.880
 Austria until then
