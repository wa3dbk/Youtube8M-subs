today<00:00:09.420> I'm<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.750> talk<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
today I'm going to talk about the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.580 
today I'm going to talk about the
process<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.130> having<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.580> dental<00:00:11.849> implant

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
process of having a dental implant

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.709 
process of having a dental implant
having<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.679> dental<00:00:14.009> implant<00:00:14.309> usually<00:00:15.210> requires

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
having a dental implant usually requires

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.900 
having a dental implant usually requires
a<00:00:16.199> series<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> procedures<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.520> some

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
a series of procedures and some

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.269 
a series of procedures and some
appointments<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.630> office<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.410> say<00:00:19.980> usually

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
appointments in the office I say usually

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.150 
appointments in the office I say usually
because<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> depends<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.050> already<00:00:22.830> are

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
because it depends if you already are

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
because it depends if you already are
missing<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> tooth<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:25.230> tooth<00:00:25.560> needs<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.039> be

missing the tooth or a tooth needs to be
extracted<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.849> timeline<00:00:27.390> will<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.720> different

for<00:00:28.380> both<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.800> those<00:00:29.179> let's<00:00:30.179> talk<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
for both of those let's talk about that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.319 
for both of those let's talk about that
more<00:00:30.929> traditional<00:00:31.140> scenario<00:00:32.009> where<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.610> tooth

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219

hopefully<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> tooth<00:00:37.410> has<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.680> been

missing<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> short<00:00:38.670> period<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> time<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
missing for a short period of time that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510 
missing for a short period of time that
would<00:00:39.809> mean<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.320> bone<00:00:40.590> has<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.129> shrunk

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
would mean that your bone has not shrunk

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
would mean that your bone has not shrunk
that<00:00:41.730> much<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.989> tooth<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.500> missing<00:00:43.920> for

that much any tooth that's missing for

that much any tooth that's missing for
any<00:00:44.280> extended<00:00:44.910> duration<00:00:45.480> four<00:00:46.140> months<00:00:46.890> or

any extended duration four months or

any extended duration four months or
more<00:00:47.250> typically<00:00:47.820> we'll<00:00:48.420> begin<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.230> bone

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
more typically we'll begin to see bone

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
more typically we'll begin to see bone
loss<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> occurs<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.360> bone<00:00:51.570> loss<00:00:51.809> could

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
loss that occurs that bone loss could

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
loss that occurs that bone loss could
require<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> bone<00:00:52.860> grafting<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> order<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
require a bone grafting in order to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.200 
require a bone grafting in order to
rebuild<00:00:54.719> lost<00:00:55.260> bone<00:00:55.699> because<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.910> haven't

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
rebuild lost bone because you haven't

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
rebuild lost bone because you haven't
been<00:00:57.329> using<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> bone<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> tooth

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
been using the bone because the tooth

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.209 
been using the bone because the tooth
isn't<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.609> if<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.780> tooth<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.170> missing<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:02.129> we

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
isn't there if a tooth is missing and we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.810 
isn't there if a tooth is missing and we
have<00:01:02.370> adequate<00:01:02.940> bone<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.979> back

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
have adequate bone and it's in the back

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200 
have adequate bone and it's in the back
of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> mouth<00:01:06.360> typically<00:01:07.700> healing<00:01:08.700> time<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of the mouth typically healing time is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
of the mouth typically healing time is
about<00:01:09.510> three<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.200> four<00:01:10.409> months<00:01:10.799> once<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
about three to four months once the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
about three to four months once the
implant<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> placed<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> time

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
implant is placed that is about the time

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
implant is placed that is about the time
it<00:01:13.140> takes<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.619> implant<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.159> fuse<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it takes for an implant to fuse to the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.320 
it takes for an implant to fuse to the
jaw<00:01:14.970> bone<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> tooth<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> top

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
jaw bone to then make the tooth on top

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.660 
jaw bone to then make the tooth on top
of<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.020> during<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> period<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
of it so during that period of time the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
of it so during that period of time the
implant<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> tooth<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.320> made

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
implant is in but the tooth is not made

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.130 
implant is in but the tooth is not made
the<00:01:23.580> reason<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.930> don't

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the reason for that is that you don't

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.359 
the reason for that is that you don't
want<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.810> use<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.110> chew<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> implant<00:01:29.130> too

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
want to use or chew on the implant too

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.870 
want to use or chew on the implant too
early<00:01:29.850> it'd<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.229> analogous<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.770> having<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
early it'd be analogous to having a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
early it'd be analogous to having a
broken<00:01:33.299> arm<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.259> cast<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.040> then

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
broken arm that was in a cast and then

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
broken arm that was in a cast and then
lifting<00:01:36.630> weights<00:01:36.900> while<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> cast

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
lifting weights while you have the cast

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
lifting weights while you have the cast
on<00:01:38.670> probably<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.299> something<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> would

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
on probably not something that you would

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.550 
on probably not something that you would
do<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> second<00:01:41.790> scenario<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
do the second scenario would be if you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
do the second scenario would be if you
need<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> tooth<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.270> needs<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
need have a tooth that needs to be

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
need have a tooth that needs to be
extracted<00:01:46.380> let's<00:01:46.770> say<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.950> had<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> root<00:01:47.369> canal

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
extracted let's say you had a root canal

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.300 
extracted let's say you had a root canal
and<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.570> root<00:01:48.750> canal<00:01:49.049> tooth<00:01:49.439> broke<00:01:49.979> or

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and the root canal tooth broke or

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.789 
and the root canal tooth broke or
fractured<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> root<00:01:51.299> which<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:52.229> common

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
fractured the root which is very common

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.179 
fractured the root which is very common
and<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.460> tooth<00:01:53.700> needs<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.360> extracted

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
and the tooth needs to be extracted
