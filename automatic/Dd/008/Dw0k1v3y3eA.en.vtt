battery at night very slow drain process
here's<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.150> whole<00:02:32.330> fuel<00:02:32.690> system<00:02:33.170> up<00:02:33.350> front<00:02:33.819> if

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
here's the whole fuel system up front if

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.809 
here's the whole fuel system up front if
the<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> right<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.810> your<00:02:35.840> pump<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.220> center

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
the on the right is your pump the center

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.910 
the on the right is your pump the center
is<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> filter<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.930> left<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.350> regulator

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
is a filter to the left is the regulator

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.300 
is a filter to the left is the regulator
and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.870> cool<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:42.380> off<00:02:42.620> since<00:02:43.130> my

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and then the cool it all off since my

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.150 
and then the cool it all off since my
pump<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.850> not<00:02:44.060> inside<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.810> fuel<00:02:45.170> tank<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.920> have

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
pump is not inside the fuel tank we have

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.030 
pump is not inside the fuel tank we have
a<00:02:46.400> radiator<00:02:48.130> cool<00:02:49.130> down<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.489> fuel<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.440> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
a radiator cool down the fuel so that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.849 
a radiator cool down the fuel so that
solves<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.519> problem

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
solves that problem

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.470 
solves that problem
and<00:02:54.859> everything's<00:02:55.519> kind<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.850> sandwich<00:02:56.239> fit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and everything's kind of a sandwich fit

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.580 
and everything's kind of a sandwich fit
everything's<00:02:56.959> pretty<00:02:57.140> small

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.910 

and<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.610> that
