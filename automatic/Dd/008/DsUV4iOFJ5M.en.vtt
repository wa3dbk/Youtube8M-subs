00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.490
 The papers above knew you here 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.069
 Do you put on the fold line in the middle 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.219

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.819
 the opposite side of the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:12.290

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.280
 if you continue your papers as 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.790
 Next you have to get the top paper 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.140
 knew to pull down and that exactly 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.990
 all the pieces of paper up to here 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.799
 with your finger between the paper and 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.590
 put it on there was the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.060

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.329
 this paper knew each other 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:19.530
 then click on the second page 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:21.419

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.909
 you still get your heart out of it 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:29.549
 with paper tips slightly inside 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:32.329
 kinked so you have a rounding and at 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.280
 the second page is the same 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:39.840
 tips act and the curves now 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.659
 to fold you go to the sides of the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.659
 upper tip you believe now down 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.359
 on the second page it works the same way 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.040
 again the upper tip is here at the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:59.310
