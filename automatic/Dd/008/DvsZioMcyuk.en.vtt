00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to their venom we could definitely gain

to their venom we could definitely gain
an<00:01:57.479> advantage<00:01:59.090> damn<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
an advantage damn it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.819 
an advantage damn it
check<00:02:00.869> off<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.229> much<00:02:01.349> time<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.709> we<00:02:01.739> have

check off how much time do we have

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
check off how much time do we have
that's<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.670> current<00:02:03.000> rate<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.179> constriction
