 war gaming owes much of his 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.240
 fortune world of tanks before arrival 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.950

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.820
 small Belarusian company had 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.619
 developed only minor titles without ever 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.690
 being able to really break through the landscape 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.699
 videogame as often happens in these 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.500
 cases, however, it was really enough to hit one 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.390
 market niche at the empty time for 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.160
 explode completely and start 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
 grind money out of any forecast 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.210
 logic within an organic year 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.160
 puntonet has moved from a house to 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 production almost unknown to true e 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.970
 own pillar of the industry giving 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.980
 among other things to us journalists 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.809
 some of the most memorable events of the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.790
 last few years to continue riding 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.219
 the wave of success must, however, be achieved 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.780
 know how to renew and while on pc world 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.489
 of warplanes and world of work ships 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.290
 continue to attract public up 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.600
 console only the simulator has landed 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.190
 wartime tank for more like 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.980
 exclusive to xbox 360 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.079
 the big news for 2015 is that world 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.590
 of tanks will finally land up too 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.899
 next gen 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.789
 as an exclusive xbox one and we are 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.530
 flew straight into Chicago's studios for 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.240
 try it in preview 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.800
 if you have played or if you still are 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.319
 playing world of tanks in version 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.959
 xbox 360 gets the good news right away 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.310
 the two microsoft home consoles 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.850
 will use the exact same account 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.590
 of play 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.840
 which means you can keep 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.250
 all your progress and jump from 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.910
 one version to the other without any kind 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.979
 of problem 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.750
 this is because world of tanks will include 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.819
 with this new release the possibility 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.289
 to play in cross platform even 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.849
 implementing a chat system 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.770
 thanks to which to dialogue with yours 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.959
 team mates regardless of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 platform used in spite of 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.810
 these small features however the big one 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.789
 of the best and we find it in the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.580
 technical sector with enormous progress 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.289
 made from production in this sense each 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.330
 single tanque was rebuilt with 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.220
 an upper polygonal mass and now the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.140
 game is visually really excellent 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.640
 if you add all this the smoke 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 volumetric a lighting system 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 brand new and just not to make us 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.619
 miss nothing 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.819
 a renewed destructibility of buildings 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.229
 and environment 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.759
 we are obviously not talking about a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.590
 new game but all these details 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.780
 they really make the xbox version look like 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.970
 one a quality product completely 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 different than in the past and care 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.800
 in detail according to us 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.270
 harris so much quality the weather system 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.250
 now actively affects the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.140
 vegetation with gusts of wind that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.120
 move trees and bushes preventing 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.980
 treat the visual thus giving these 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.050
 simple aesthetic elements a renewed 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 role during games for how long 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.170
 regards the gameplay is not there instead 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.060
 much to add compared to the past 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.860
 we tried the title for a couple 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.380
 good hours and the feeling of the simulator 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.450
 weblog wargaming.net unchanged this way 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.250
 as the tir structure for the choice of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.660
 tanks 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.489
 being a cross platform game there 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.739
 will be bonus means for the xbox version 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.599
 one and all future content will come 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.250
 released simultaneously on both 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.080
 platforms the philosophy of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
 wargaming.net to make a product 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.500
 technically superior in everything 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.579
 but still leave the players there 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.890
 possibility to choose where 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.720
 prefer to play without forcing them either 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.650
 force them in any way to pass on 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 next gen 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
 said this pad to the hand something now 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.380
 has changed in tank management 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.630
 above all thanks to the renewed system 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.970
 physical since now on xbox one comes 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.560
 used the new avoc engine in 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.660
 this way the tanks can 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 be literally torn to pieces with 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.139
 an excellent rendering of exploded shots e 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.850
 impact on the armor 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.739
 all obviously only for relevance 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.480
 aesthetic just to prevent it 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.670
 go to create imbalances between the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.840
 different verses of consoles appear 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.519
 even all those pitchers now 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.530
 indispensable to expand the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.239
 popularity of the game as the possibility 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.310
 to upload screenshots full support 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 to streaming on tweets and of course i 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.299
 replay projects for this version ad 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.130
 anyway they certainly don't stop here 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.959
 and a further patch is already planned 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.060
 through which to introduce a new one 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.010
 team training mode to organize 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.569
 tactics and study strategies for 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.790
 different maps in complete tranquility 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.319
 element that demonstrates as word gaming 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.359
 continue to bet also on the side 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.500
 competitive production already 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.940
 widely distributed among teams 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.940
 professionals in the sector
