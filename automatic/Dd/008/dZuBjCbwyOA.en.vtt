00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.100

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.100
 daily share 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.709
 hey people from daily months 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.870
 available and welcome to a calf study 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.220
 blackops two commentary and i said that 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.420
 my name is specter that is my name 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.930
 not at all my name is actually 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.210
 vincent 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.400
 but on youtube youtube better known as 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.750
 pitcher or specter 1994 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.130
 but today I want to have a jury 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.000
 about something more serious subject matter 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.990
 not present such very often 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.730
 daily shrimp 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.460
 so i just thought of let me just 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.660
 discuss something more serious 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.660
 and that is indeed 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.850
 bag what you now saw so the cookie wall 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.710
 yes you probably know it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.570
 we are all gamers of course 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760
 we are all on the internet we 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.610
 all which computer we service super many 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.310
 all in the Netherlands and yes what you just 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.440
 was of course the so-called 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.300
 cookie wall and that was a few days 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.760
 ago really yes pretty important 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 news in the Dutch children's network 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.649
 because like most of you 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.840
 probably know there was in 2012 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.100
 I think if I look very good 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 my head already that button it it just 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.960
 looked up there June 5 there was new laws 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.409
 namely imported into the Netherlands 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.289
 telecommunications law and it became one 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.549
 certain regulations laid down about this 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.259
 is called the cow choose the people who 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.899
 do not know what cookies are 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.450
 Cookies are just small files that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.249
 yes put websites on your computer to 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 for example your 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.459
 surfing behavior when holding a google 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.380
 for example, used a lot at his 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.179
 ads then you keep track of to which 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.219
 websites you've been to and can 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.170
 they just targeted ads there oh 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.149
 yes show to you making you not such 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.740
 their being spammed by things 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.520
 that didn't interest you that is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.920
 of course good for all 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.749
 advertisers but you have only two 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 different types of cookies 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.429
 you have essential cookies 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.929
 and that, for example, involves things 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.539
 for example make sure you 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 shopping basket not empty 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.530
 yes what do you call that is not being lived there 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.030
 goes to another page and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.470
 one suspect that our another one 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.479
 essential cuby I have another example 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.920
 no i don't have a cow i don't have one yet 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.680
 cookie example 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.880
 marie van je therefore an essential cookies 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.220
 and you also have the less important ones 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 cookies and those were cookies that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.530
 Google uses to monitor your surfing behavior 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 and that law that has the Netherlands 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.950
 implemented 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 ensures that if website say so 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.580
 who want non-essential cookies 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.650
 places on your computer then they must 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.810
 request explicit permission for this and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.959
 there was thus the one that problem 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.030
 we have many websites from that cookie wall 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.510
 family of the major websites 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.280
 the netherlands that yes that stopped such a pop-up 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.320
 it because they had to get permission 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.290
 ask for those non-essential cookies 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.160
 places and in my opinion that is real 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.200
 super annoying because yes if you 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.480
 goes to a website every time and they 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.160
 every time a pop-up window is required 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.350
 during your explicit permission 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.370
 ask then it is just super 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.489
 irritated the it's not 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.790
 user-friendly is not use 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.470
 easy 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.480
 that is not even a word but you understand 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.820
 what i mean it's just really one 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.079
 flirt were actually meaningless 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.660
 most people who click anyway right away 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.519
 on agreement that is the biggest lie on 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.900
 the interwebs that you say yes I go 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.489
 He agreed with it because most people 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.350
 who read and yet not 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.269
 so it 's actually a bit of a 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.739
 bullshit law but yes 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.739
 The Netherlands had to lead the way 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.130
 Europe had a cookie work so that one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.590
 Law was introduced only a few days 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.030
 ago the news came out that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.790
 the press group I think are those 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.590
 volkskrant under the other of the hd and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.890
 the parool that they call the cookie 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.070
 walls on their website the website websites 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.820
 is going to delete and that simply means 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.250
 that you still have a kind of to stream 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.600
 must give permission but it is coming 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.609
 just a bar below that in the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.440
 website or at the top of the website where 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.120
 is simply stated yes we post 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.070
 non-essential cookies on it and you do 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.320
 not really give permission 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.910
 there is just if you ignore it then give 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.420
 you actually consent and that is too 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.799
 something i don't know one or the other 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.269
 way peaceful no longer play the names 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.190
 but who wants that is say the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.480
 cookie law so that people 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.980
 does not need explicit permission 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.609
 but that such a bar is full of 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.750
 the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.060
 move a state of yes 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.909
 non-essential cookies on your computer 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.500
 and if you ignore the then you go there 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:27.439
 actually automatically agree 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.909
 but I wondered what is your opinion 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.740
 what did you think about that cookie wall 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.819
 you think that's important 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.319
 is 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.550
 yes or level that i need something else 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.710
 to formulate 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.419
 what we care about your privacy 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.150
 or phoebe ease of use on the internet 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.680
 so check from 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.750
 do you prefer privacy then do you 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.610
 such an annoying pop-up that you are there 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.560
 must give permission or have you there 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.029
 just shit an you find it alone 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.259
 but easy 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.490
 for example that you targeted 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.930
 ads get bullshit 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.479
 ads that don't belong to you 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.039
 applicable and therefore not 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.779
 let annoying poops leave that for a while 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.919
 know in a response there I am 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.080
 curious about 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.360
 because in my area I belong there 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.979
 not really that much left 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.719
 only the people yes who have a little something 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.520
 so don't have the more sense of it 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.500
 the real life like fathers and mothers 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.909
 you don't actually hear that at all 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.379
 but door with friends left then 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.029
 refrigerator 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.560
 and then it is actually already 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.539
 immediately clear of this this is actually 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.110
 pretty cunt I think of that 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.110
 toppers 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.180
 yes my personally did not make it that whole 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.789
 much out 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.469
 you don't have your privacy after that 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.210
 more nowadays everything is 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:35.479
 saved with facebook and twitter 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.610
 formerly home and youtube becomes everything 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.680
 anyway yes there will be all sorts 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.479
 data about you already saved by what is 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.969
 the google microsoft 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.620
 all that kind of apple companies that him 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.150
 anyway we already have data so that about you 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.319
 to a decision 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.330
 so my doesn't matter that much 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.339
 just want to get rid of that super irritant the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.900
 cookie walls everywhere i just want tasty 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.849
 of bar of if I ignore it then go

 I agree but can see the this one 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.509
 there's a nice thought julia leaves green 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:00.650
