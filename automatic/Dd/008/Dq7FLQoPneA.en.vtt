glass<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> front<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.510> they're<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
glass on the front so they're very

a lot of people take for granted with
tablets<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> computers<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.440> general<00:00:37.770> usually

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
tablets and computers in general usually

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220 
tablets and computers in general usually
they<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.610> throw<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> bag<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.629> and

they just throw them in a bag right and
they're<00:00:40.649> susceptible<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.340> denting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they're susceptible to denting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.479 
they're susceptible to denting
scratching<00:00:42.660> stuff<00:00:43.590> happens<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.219> yeah

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
exactly and we talk about denting and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
exactly and we talk about denting and
scratching<00:00:47.280> before<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> our<00:00:48.230> special

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
scratching before we get to our special

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.049 
scratching before we get to our special
demo<00:00:49.550> let's<00:00:50.550> talk<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.270> pure<00:00:51.600> glass

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
demo let's talk about that pure glass

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.369 
demo let's talk about that pure glass
screen<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.230> pretty

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
screen because there are some pretty

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
screen because there are some pretty
simple<00:00:55.739> ways<00:00:55.890> i<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.579> sort<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
simple ways i would think just sort of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
simple ways i would think just sort of
you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:57.000> give<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> protection<00:00:58.170> i<00:00:58.320> give<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you know give it a protection i give it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.540 
you know give it a protection i give it
some<00:00:58.859> sort<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> protection<00:00:59.370> without

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
some sort of protection without

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
some sort of protection without
hindering<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.899> screen<00:01:01.170> does<00:01:01.350> right

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
hindering what that screen does right

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 
hindering what that screen does right
yeah<00:01:02.039> there's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> couple<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.000> screen

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
yeah there's a couple of screen

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329

take<00:01:12.570> keys<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> even<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> diamond<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
take keys to it even the diamond and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.219 
take keys to it even the diamond and
you're<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.850> protecting<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.570> piece<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you're just protecting a piece of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
you're just protecting a piece of
plastic<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:16.950> stuck<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> front<00:01:17.850> all

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
plastic that's stuck to the front all

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
plastic that's stuck to the front all
right<00:01:18.210> better<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> static<00:01:19.409> screen

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
right better than a static screen

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
right better than a static screen
protector<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> doesn't<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
protector because it doesn't it has a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
protector because it doesn't it has a
spray<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> bonds<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> device<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> lot

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
spray so it bonds to the device a lot

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.850 
spray so it bonds to the device a lot

like<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.640> invisishield<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
like the invisishield is it the kind of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
like the invisishield is it the kind of
thing<00:01:34.170> where<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.790> let's<00:01:36.180> say<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.750> keys

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
thing where it's a so let's say my keys

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
thing where it's a so let's say my keys
are<00:01:37.020> something<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.500> scratch<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> plastic<00:01:38.700> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
are something do scratch the plastic can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.149 
are something do scratch the plastic can
I<00:01:39.119> replace<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> pee<00:01:40.229> lock<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> pry<00:01:40.920> or

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I replace it as a pee lock and I pry or

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
I replace it as a pee lock and I pry or
is<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> once<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.090> well<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
is it once it's there it's there well it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
is it once it's there it's there well it
stays<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.530> better<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> spray

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
stays on better because of the spray

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
stays on better because of the spray
right<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.509> definitely<00:01:45.659> peel<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
right you can definitely peel it off it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.130 
right you can definitely peel it off it
also<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> lifetime<00:01:47.460> guarantee<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
also is a lifetime guarantee so if it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 
also is a lifetime guarantee so if it
does<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.619> scratched<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> point<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
does get scratched to the point that you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.340 
does get scratched to the point that you
can<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> scratch<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.229> when

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
can see the scratch all the time when

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.359 
can see the scratch all the time when
you're<00:01:52.470> using<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> just
