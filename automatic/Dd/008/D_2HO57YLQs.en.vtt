00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 yeah league of legends just yet 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:18.600
 quickly a champion pronounced and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:20.010
 let's go hello hello hello so 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.449
 it does not always run around people 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.320
 So somehow this is weird 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.320
 old chancellor forgot 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 tomorrow and welcome here 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.650
 the german e-cars channel we have just 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.330
 just trying a superspiel 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:52.739
 but it does not quite work 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:54.360
 works properly because of it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.580
 Maybe you know this picture it is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 a pretty annoying picture what heaven 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.140
 offers to show up with me actually 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 every time I play the lol 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 Realplayer wants to use one or 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.170
 other of you knows the problem 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.420
 maybe series itself is actually 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.250
 Secondarily, I have to say that right 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.259
 no longer compete many functions 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 but since the penultimate I petschat 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.920
 personally the problem that the whole 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 shit always crashes with me and that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.450
 is extreme but no reason to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.130
 despair people it gives me 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.830
 alternative maybe you already know 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.740
 one or the other it is called barrel 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.050
 replays and what barrel replays exactly is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.240
 let's be clear now 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.789
 that's where we are again 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 this is the side of waverly place 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.810
 as you can easily see is too 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 can be found at the address https 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.540
 colon tw is therefore one 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 Taiwanese side yes if you 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.360
 Taiwanese language is not powerful 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.930
 since i just go to english and here 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 That should actually be with you 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 work yes and here you see 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 the construction of the program you see her 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.329
 Replay similar to Bauer as well as the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.119
 shouted layer and here you can still one 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.340
 few games you have to look at quasi 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.160
 recorded games of high caliber 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.010
 play when bored but have good 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.010
 Okay, that's the possibility you offer 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.320
 you the the in game client of lol 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.769
 anyway, that's why you can do that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.030
 Look no further than a download 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.860
 click and then you can do that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.019
 whole package download still needs 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.360
 not even the frame but the network 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.280
 you would need it anyway anyway 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.660
 that should be in the case of those at the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.739
 Most users in any case from windows 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.350
 7 I think it is anyway 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.640
 by default with otherwise installed 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.640
 you can download it yes 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.910
 so now we are already 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.560
 loading screen and you actually see 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.350
 even the whole is at least 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.390
 just as fast as the blu ray player 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:07.910
 had done as you have on everyone 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 case no restriction like 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.060
 equalized the whole starts me off 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.710
 at least not at the beginning 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.740
 but probably moderately in the back or in 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.390
 the middle there you have a little bit more 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.700
 a little bit of what to do with that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.920
 I know that I know that too 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.570
 not it is unlikely there 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.380
 programmed peter I say times or 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.230
 maybe there are also versions 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.460
 conflicts i know is not good the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.670
 iplayer of course with his 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.650
 to struggle and therefore it is 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.930
 now no no big criticism of 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.690
 where you can say that's it goes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.520
 Do not disturb too much else 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.370
 you already see them exactly the same 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.850
 See how even in the case mlp 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.090
 is and still just like the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.300
 spectator mode in the client itself you have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.480
 you the champions you can too 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.690
 ehc camps where you want 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.620
 on one side of the minimap above the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.600
 Team do what gold and towers and felt 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.340
 and first on how the possibility 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.310
 like here I am the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.500
 expressions in the indie team view too 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.600
 change the below 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.220
 that's just the two teams that are 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950
 face and the bar of the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.540
 currently only down on the violet 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.760
 side is filled that it is just the side 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.070
 Life represents what you just do 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.930
 nice to analyze 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.900
 yes it was in any case of life already 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.560
 good times to start this team or just 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.740
 neither 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.940
 is definitely helpful what 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.530
 be taken into account in any case 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.540
 So now life has to be one 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.300
 but cool down are of course 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.520
 the other thing from that is that now 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.140
 not very meaningful of this life 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.140
 were life bar the below 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.760
 yes a few small mistakes has the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.370
 Of course iplayer then also one 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.620
 few bugs that come to the fore 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.260
 if you replay longer sessions and 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.540
 then again with the with the 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.310
 So speed plays when you 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.390
 more common rewind ago 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.740
 then rewind again slower 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.210
 play and slow down again 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.500
 normal speed again 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.850
 so that the speeds can play 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.020
 it's too small here and there 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.670
 failures come as in the last one 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:31.230
 to see replay 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.520
 I can show it for a moment 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.750
 teamed or clouded a bit and 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.100
 to help on the hotline 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.230
 the mps and now comes the best best 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.270
 situation 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.970
 the table stands here and miss fortune 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.880
 now ignites their multi and 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.680
 meets almost all champions 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.990
 you can see that well Valerie KlÃ¤ger 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.640
 a little bit of rum , but it saves you 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.160
 as champions at least once 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.690
 met and that was for katharina and 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.140
 The sign of the immediately in to me 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.419
 go 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.220
 to cut one by one out of cage 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.620
 also plays in and the tristan with 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.500
 made a desperation jump too 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.370
 We can do a wonderful job again 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.860
 generate three to zero 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.280
 yes that allows us the first one now 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.550
 push with tower and then later too 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.710
 again to take the dirt off 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.210
 a bit far here as it 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.600
 look that are unfortunately a few 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.690
 small grow replays yes as you can see 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.340
 some still really expandable that 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.630
 but maybe always in the program 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.600
 you with the next version, too 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.210
 already fixed by that we observe that 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.680
 just in any case 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.710
 as actually looks a relatively 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.250
 functional realplayer with all 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.300
 Features that you the the original 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.940
 Replay halt also just offers just stop 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.500
 still not quite as mature 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.390
 like the original wii play if the 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.710
 original elf would work 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.500
 I would continue to use it 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.320
 but bears replays is definitely 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.320
 a great alternative i just give you 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.700
 can put everything in the heart I hope 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.540
 you have this little information 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.250
 video liked 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.070
 if yes gives me a thumbs up 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:18.040
 I would be delighted 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:18.040
 otherwise makes it purely good and hau
