00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:09.868
 Garden in the ball a year later 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.840
 Sunday 12 December 2010 a year later 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.720
 four gardens in a ball to check 

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.228
 Detach the two hemispheres gently 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 prune too large parts of the plant 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 natural cutting: a leaf has developed many roots 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 proceed with pruning 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.580
 close the sphere carefully 

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:06.278
 another garden in the ball: open with the usual caution 

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:14.482
 the plant has grown through the hole beyond the borders of "his world" 

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958
 prune too large parts ... 

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:24.318
 ... immediately above the new leaf shoots 

00:01:49.904 --> 00:01:52.904
 third garden in a ball 

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:04.978
 in this case the moss has grown too much 

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:21.042
 intervene by cutting a good part of the moss 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.990
 in addition to moss an herbaceous has also developed 

00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:49.344
 remove excess moss 

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:57.602
 other spontaneous cutting 

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:13.894
 fourth micro garden 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 inside a Capelvenere 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.070
 remove the dried parts 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
 ... and check off those in excess
