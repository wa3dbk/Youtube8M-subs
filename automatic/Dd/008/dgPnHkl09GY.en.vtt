now I will make sure that there's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.770 
now I will make sure that there's
nothing<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.359> there<00:03:02.700> yep<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.180> we<00:03:04.329> go<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.689> I

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
as with any case you install the buttons

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.649 
as with any case you install the buttons
first<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.109> then<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.919> just<00:03:12.069> pop<00:03:12.849> it<00:03:13.000> over<00:03:13.120> like

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
first and then you just pop it over like

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.470 
first and then you just pop it over like
so<00:03:14.340> making<00:03:15.340> sure<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.760> all<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.030> edges<00:03:16.359> are

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
so making sure that all the edges are

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.670 
so making sure that all the edges are
covered<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.400> aligned<00:03:18.400> like<00:03:18.849> that<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:20.379> do<00:03:20.500> get

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
covered and aligned like that you do get

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.190 
covered and aligned like that you do get
a<00:03:20.709> little<00:03:20.829> bit<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.389> flexibility<00:03:22.389> in<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.959> case

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
a little bit of flexibility in the case

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.629 
a little bit of flexibility in the case
but<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.189> does<00:03:24.340> hold<00:03:24.579> its<00:03:24.819> true<00:03:25.419> form<00:03:25.599> factor

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
but it does hold its true form factor

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.909 
but it does hold its true form factor
and<00:03:27.639> then<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.879> course<00:03:27.909> I'm<00:03:28.389> now<00:03:28.629> going<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.989> give

would<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.259> liked<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.620> seen<00:04:35.889> them<00:04:36.130> like

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
would have liked to have seen them like

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.330 
would have liked to have seen them like
the<00:04:37.210> bumper<00:04:37.810> case<00:04:37.990> by<00:04:38.229> Apple<00:04:38.560> where<00:04:39.219> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
the bumper case by Apple where the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.890 
the bumper case by Apple where the
buttons<00:04:39.700> themselves

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
buttons themselves

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.800 
buttons themselves
the<00:04:41.110> buttons<00:04:41.440> are<00:04:41.710> silver<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.780> being

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the buttons are silver but with it being

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.300 
the buttons are silver but with it being
a<00:04:43.930> rubber<00:04:44.110> case<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.410> don't<00:04:44.710> think<00:04:44.919> any<00:04:45.100> sort<00:04:45.280> of

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
a rubber case I don't think any sort of

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.189 
a rubber case I don't think any sort of
paint<00:04:45.550> would<00:04:45.699> stick<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:46.930> think

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
paint would stick to that so I think

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.580 
paint would stick to that so I think
that's<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.470> reason<00:04:47.590> why<00:04:47.740> they<00:04:48.190> are<00:04:48.550> not<00:04:48.820> so

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
that's the reason why they are not so

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.719 
that's the reason why they are not so
going<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.830> bottom<00:04:51.009> of<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.250> case<00:04:51.460> here

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
going on to the bottom of the case here

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.210 
going on to the bottom of the case here
you<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.150> see<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.889> opening<00:04:53.889> there<00:04:54.039> for

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
you can see that the opening there for

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.240 
you can see that the opening there for
the<00:04:54.310> dock<00:04:54.520> connector<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.180> fully<00:04:55.750> accessible

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
the dock connector is fully accessible

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.620 
the dock connector is fully accessible
you<00:04:57.250> see<00:04:57.460> though<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.729> evenly<00:04:58.030> matched<00:04:58.270> you

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
you see though it's evenly matched you

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.240 
you see though it's evenly matched you
got<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.840> screws<00:04:59.199> either<00:04:59.500> side<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.100> that

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
got the screws either side there that

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.379 
got the screws either side there that
are<00:05:00.370> evenly<00:05:00.669> spaced<00:05:01.300> apart<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:03.699> speaker

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
are evenly spaced apart and the speaker

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.810 
are evenly spaced apart and the speaker
and<00:05:04.570> microphone<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.919> I've<00:05:06.340> actually<00:05:06.550> found

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
and microphone so I've actually found

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.610 
and microphone so I've actually found
out<00:05:07.060> now<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.270> this<00:05:07.600> side<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.169> speaker

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
out now that this side is the speaker

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.659 
out now that this side is the speaker
and<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:09.460> side<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:10.030> microphone<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:12.490> then

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
and this side is the microphone and then

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.189 
and this side is the microphone and then
go<00:05:12.759> into<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:13.120> rest<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.479> case<00:05:13.690> now<00:05:13.960> will

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
go into the rest of the case now will

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.170 
go into the rest of the case now will
actually<00:05:14.500> show<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.949> back<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.970> can<00:05:16.030> see

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
but as you can see it a pretty good

I'm not going to do that I don't like
the<00:06:07.599> idea<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:09.039> then<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.280> get<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.430> nice

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
the idea and then you get a nice

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.159 
the idea and then you get a nice
generous<00:06:10.120> cut<00:06:11.080> out<00:06:11.260> there<00:06:11.530> for<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:13.169> camera

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
generous cut out there for the camera

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.480

and<00:06:14.349> the<00:06:14.620> LED<00:06:15.070> flash<00:06:15.430> and<00:06:16.979> overall<00:06:17.979> I<00:06:18.190> do<00:06:18.280> like

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
and the LED flash and overall I do like

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.460 
and the LED flash and overall I do like
the<00:06:19.270> look<00:06:19.419> of<00:06:19.510> this<00:06:19.659> case<00:06:19.900> hence<00:06:20.199> the<00:06:20.380> reason

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
the look of this case hence the reason

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.159 
the look of this case hence the reason
why<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.770> bought<00:06:21.010> it<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:21.539> it<00:06:22.539> feels<00:06:22.810> really
