00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
style to what he says and the character

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.790 
style to what he says and the character
of<00:00:58.890> Alan<00:00:59.579> Gregory<00:01:00.149> fits<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.960> style<00:01:01.379> very

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

much and so there is some humor there
but<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> humor<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.610> nowhere<00:01:06.119> near<00:01:06.540> enough<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
but that humor is nowhere near enough to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340
