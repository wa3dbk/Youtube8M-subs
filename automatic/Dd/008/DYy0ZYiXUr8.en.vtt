00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.339
 video in this is about the topic 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.379
 alcohol and muscle training which 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 the consumption of alcohol has an influence 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.860
 Muscle building and general on the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.360
 human body 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.950
 basically it is that way 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.080
 Alcohols human body as 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
 toxin is identified and the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 digestive tract tried this 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.340
 naturally, toxin as fast as 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.769
 possible to get rid of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 For this, the alcohol in the liver is in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.570
 the substance acetate is converted to the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.199
 then use the body as a source of energy 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.609
 can 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.050
 this process of transformation of 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.090
 However, alcohols has the consequence that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.800
 metabolism and digestion processes in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 human body slows down greatly 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.829
 and thereby the fat burning 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.719
 naturally greatly diminished 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.180
 this naturally results in that in the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.010
 time of detoxification yes the body is not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 as good body fat can break down 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 rather in the opposite Fed is much much 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 easier in the fat cells 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 stored by the liver 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.500
 almost in the human body 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 suffering from alcohol alone 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 Of course, other main tasks are this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 a main task is the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 human body with energy too 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.469
 explicitly provide the muscle cells with 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.600
 to supply energy 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.670
 in short, necessary carbohydrates and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 Proteins can no longer be sufficient 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 transported to the muscle cells 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 accordingly, it comes here to a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.610
 restriction 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.409
 besides, alcohol decided the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.909
 human body fluid very much 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 a lot of fluid and what's special in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.759
 the development phase and the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 human body is now for 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 most of it is liquid 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.430
 the majority of muscle cells 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.810
 there are liquid or blood which 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 everything flows through us 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 large part of liquid from water and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 if we water our body now 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600
 withdraw or no water to feel then 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.640
 it can lead to muscle cramps 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
 Muscle fail to headache 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.939
 we feel tired and tired and and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 and accordingly is at 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.979
 Consumption of sufficient water 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.479
 liquids have been indispensable for so long 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.799
 So you consume alcohol and the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.299
 Body must dismantle this and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 accordingly as a source of energy in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 form of acetate is used 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.720
 strong restrictions in the various 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.770
 metabolism processes such as 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 the connection and the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 energy supply the consumption of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.649
 Alcohol also influences ours 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 hormone balance especially two hormones 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.799
 Here are the cortisol 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.450
 and the testosterone 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.069
 both are im in the two important hormones 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 human body many many 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.349
 property 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.239
 have both become interesting 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.250
 hormones and their effects with a view 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.620
 on the aspects of strength training and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.510
 muscle building testosterone is very very 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 important for muscle formation and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.079
 influences the metabolism positively 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 basically it is that masculinity 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.909
 Hormone cortisol on the other hand 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.730
 In simple terms, conversely, it works 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.200
 is considered to be against hormone testosterone 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.690
 It is among others for the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.010
 protein breakdown in the muscles 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.359
 We have one area in charge 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.609
 so the testosterone what as 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.930
 muscle building hormone can be viewed 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.209
 can and on the other side we have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.609
 that against hormone the cortisol what as 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.470
 Muscle loss hormone can be considered 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.870
 you consume and alcohol rises 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.909
 level of the hormone cortisol is strong 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.859
 In return, the level of the 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.659
 This causes hormone testosterone 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.000
 an imbalance depending on 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.170
 Alcohol consumption more than 24 hours 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.879
 can stop 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.739
 and that of course exactly the wrong one for 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.299
 Muscle building the entire body 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.310
 is not in an anabolic 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.379
 condition rather in the opposite he is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 in a catapult condition next to the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.680
 physical impact of strong 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 Of course you also have alcohol consumption 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.220
 to fight mental impact 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.290
 i think here is the concept 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.849
 Everybody knows it 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.639
 The next day makes you feel easy 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.799
 flabeless driveless and motivated 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.480
 also not necessarily lust and can 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.940
 of course strong success brakes are 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.160
 in the sense of muscle building how much 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.599
 Alcohol is ok now think flat rate can 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.530
 you do not have to answer that everyone has to 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.150
 to know for yourself 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.160
 Personally, I am of the opinion that 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.290
 a two beer or even better one 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.549
 two glasses of red wine in the week no 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.889
 the problem is the human can 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.049
 Body also a big celebration or 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.970
 even two big celebrations a year are 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.470
 no problem as long as there is no koma drink 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.970
 But you have to be here, of course 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.049
 the consequences for body and mind 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.599
 awareness 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.739
 Everyone who drinks more alcohol in the month 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.629
 that of course not be surprised 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.400
 that muscle buildup stagnates a bit 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.720
 or not at all 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.510
 and of course you have to join 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.980
 such matters awareness that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.419
 the body and especially the health 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.519
 can suffer from it 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.169
 I think the best alternative is 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.090
 course on alcohol completely too 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.280
 of course, then you do not drive on 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.479
 always remember that alcohol one 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.190
 drug is she is though 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.349
 socially acceptable resp 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.560
 socially established as well 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.200
 Alcohol can 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.000
 can be addictive and can affect the body 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.010
 thus always harms it 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.200
 aware if you have questions about the topic 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.910
 Alcohol and muscle building did not need much 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.690
 she likes to comment as a comment 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.010

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.810
 I'll ask you this fast 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.970
 go answer otherwise visit me
