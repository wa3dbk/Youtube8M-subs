 2012 which is the year that humanity will 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.030
 will remember for this event that I am 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.160
 been the online questions of the panthers ha

 they are all masterpieces of 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.840
 couple but let's hear hello I'm gay 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.270
 and yesterday I had my first experience 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 with a Senegalese boy someone from 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 you have had similar experiences 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.570
 I paid the imu 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:09.170
 let's say 2012 we remember it for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.110
 the end of the world is that for 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.150
 for many other things but maybe not for the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.500
 online questions with this however there 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.360
 however, we have shown that we know 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.670
 answer all we know how to solve 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 any doubt so this is the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.509
 poule we say the zero bet of that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.850
 that this new section will be defined 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.430
 which will be defined there are the panpers 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.740
 why for any doubt you have or 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.110
 that you come to whom you do not know how to give 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.390
 answer there are the bumpers if you have 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.700
 heart problems there are no panpers 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.439
 you know some geography questions there 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.630
 are the panpers you have doubts 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.340

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.490
 panpers there are panpers no for that 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.590
 but not for most things 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.360
 there are therefore any panpers 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.209

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.739
 an answer 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.600
 I was clear yes and we in the next 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.910
 video we will answer all the questions 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.350
 were made in the previous video 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.260
 all right 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.260
 let's evaluate everything maybe even more 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.950
 I said maybe even more 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:14.910
 there maybe they don't ask us a question e 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.910
 we give an answer there are the panpers 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.280
 there are all the panpers 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.140
 there are the panpers 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.109
 however we can give some examples is 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 just to make people understand 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.209
 oh well they understood oh well maybe not one 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.519
 has understood and reserves for example some 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.980
 question is an example for example 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.709
 you want to know how many points you make at 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.950
 fruit ninja in arcade mode without 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.670
 not even cut a fruit 65 you believed 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.040
 0 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.859
 and instead they are 65 there are the bumpers if 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.549
 you want to know what your fingers are called 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:16.099

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.930
 fondulo and mellino and you thought yes 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:21.470
 called first second third 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.090
 you believed it is instead there are bumpers though 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 you want to know what the consequences are 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.180
 of a punch in the face given fortissimo by 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.320
 a bouncer in a very bad place 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.470
 so much immense pain 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.570
 sometimes blood you thought nothing is 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:45.039
 instead all this scarring sometimes 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.710
 long-term nasal septa operations 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:52.389
 consumed there are the bumpers there are i 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.389
 panthers all of them 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.410
 let's hope 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.160
 the figure and I knew these three is enough 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.160
