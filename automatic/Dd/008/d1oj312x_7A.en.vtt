00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi it's true that at dr von 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 today small unpacking video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.210
 gives English boxing of htc on the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.500
 htc one x more to be precise is this 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.450
 that one is actually a range 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 so this is the x plus version so 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.609
 it's the best htc one that exist 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.810
 today in terms performance in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.880
 terms of design maybe for some 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are on the heavy the word stop on 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 is on the high end finally of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.220
 htc and today it's a small 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 unpacking video then first item 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 obviously comes from this video of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.300
 unpacking is the box in itself 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.099
 typically found in a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 typical packaging so typically 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.460
 typical of our Taiwanese manufacturer 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.570
 favorite that they bought so this is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 we find ourselves sailing with this famous 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 this famous white box surrounded by 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.660
 an armband too that shows in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120
 white which shows the main visual of the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.600
 phone a visual on the phone and if 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 his camera camera function has 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.239
 a certain amount of information that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.770
 are type information 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 technical specifications of the phone 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 and then information about the packaging 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 the fact that they also have recycled clab 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 and so that's the famous thing 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.330
 box of the htc one x plus so if we 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.400
 open the box so that I can do 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.220
 clips or di stefano armband is done 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.570
 to the sheaths so that's for the whirlwind 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 on a box that were the elements 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.369
 this famous white box that we 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.750
 can open so to stick there it's 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.430
 always this covered panel one is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 really typically in the package 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.680
 classic at htc the htc one is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 packed in his little protection 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.040
 public 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.450
 that's all is own usual team 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.860
 here is the famous htc one-x plus so a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.200
 phone that in terms of design and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.430
 well be totally similar to the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 previous generation that was the good 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.970
 mix all that will be presented to you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.920
 so very soon on the occasion 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 of a test video of course so 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.690
 it's the htc or onyx anymore so in the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.820
 box itself we find these points 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.070
 March 7th at the pier of social goods and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.200
 dials phone inside the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.600
 cradle we find there is a small 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.600
 documentation the documentation we 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.650
 lets have this little one a little 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 little robot actually I call it a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.770
 trombone and this time only called 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.100
 tromba that allows us simply 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.260
 in fact to extract the trapdoor in 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.880
 which is the sim card fed up 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.100
 and she will place the map at the site 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.480
 So here is this famous too modern 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 if you lose it we see that there is a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.320
 small 10 a little trombone drawing here 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.850
 so that's typical if you lose this 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.410
 little trick is good with a trombone 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 you'll get out a trombone or 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.760
 and vegetables we also find a little 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.500
 more documentation fought in 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.880
 the other thing is how to spend his 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.070
 sim card it's phenomenal 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.390
 we find documentation it is 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.140
 join htc on their facebook page 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 by the way they are nice they 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.390
 are and to the deities 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.610
 finally I can community manager does 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.080
 well his job too much we still find 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.660
 documentation a security guide 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.470
 says man is the respect of standards in 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.570
 many languages 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.040
 a guarantee card in several 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.560
 languages â€‹â€‹here is a license 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.510
 of user in English their language 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.360
 good it's not the most important one 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.739
 finds also also especially ultimately 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 the accessories the accessories which 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.980
 are they found in a small 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.080
 bag the famous pedestrian kit or a htc the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.190
 famous headset which is not 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.620
 not a job that the army that was a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.480
 earpiece on which just a little 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.040
 packaging that had everything and that allows for 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.660
 do not assault your reign when you 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.660
 place it in the ear that extends 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.030
 Jacques 3.5 is a classic hey 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.940
 hey hey we're going to debate the stories of 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.489
 see a little bit what it looks like 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.790
 possible remote control that we could 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.019
 to have 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.080
 is a wii remote what 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.100
 is just a simple microphone input on this 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.840
 famous pedestrian kit 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.310
 well there is a little button on 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.720
 off it's fine button hang up 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.340
 unhooked with the little tent the little 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.010
 microphone input so that's the pedestrian kit 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.610
 which therefore provides with this flash of his 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.140
 one x plus we also find on 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.870
 others we find and well 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.770
 - that the AC adapter that is a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.760
 AC adapter 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.660
 I have you connect a micro usb cable 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.810
 usb so here is the AC adapter 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.410
 we also find then what else 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.750
 the unavoidable cable the famous cable 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.040
 micro usb usb so the famous heading of the web 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.079
 which allows you to synchronize 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.730
 charge your phone 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:24.760
 here is the famous usb micro usb cable 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.220
 so here is a little bit of stickers 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.110
 warranty stickers and so it's 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.780
 in this logic since we find 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.840
 so we find what the packaging 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.180
 because almost as recycled clab found 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.650
 the phone as it's a monoblock that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.600
 does not have an extractable battery the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.630
 battery already in we find a 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.340
 documentation room 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.820
 here are some guarantee cards that it was 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.410
 rare we find an AC adapter 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.169
 so we find this famous micro cable 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.380
 usb usb and we find the kit being 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.270
 so here pedestrians who is well 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.970
 cable length was installed as well 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.590
 interesting if really the cable that 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.450
 is at the listener so they tell themselves everything 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.610
 simply it's not an intra 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.280
 auriculars I repeat it and that's what 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.450
 small plastic dressing added you 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.440
 will probably bring it a little 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.850
 longer than a skin 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.729
 hard plastics 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.930
 so these are present in the box of 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.070
 phone since that anyway 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.390
 it's a pretty obligation for 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.740
 builders in France when you 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.360
 to market a phone in France 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.950
 well you have to put his 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.930
 so the builders have neither more nor 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.540
 less than the obligation to put this 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.729
 with their phone so that was 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.390
 the small unpacking video gives 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.250
 boxing of the htc one-x more of this famous 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.750
 sheath that we see here 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.130
 this famous phone that I you 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.919
 will present very very soon in 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.660
 video on the youtube channel of trafford 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.900
 thank you life by watching this video at 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.900
 soon
