00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
legend 3 the previous boot well they're

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.029 
legend 3 the previous boot well they're
a<00:00:46.379> couple<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.730> big<00:00:48.539> jump<00:00:48.960> from<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> previous

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a couple it big jump from the previous

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.350 
a couple it big jump from the previous
model<00:00:50.250> yeah<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:52.070> yeah<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
model yeah and yeah first of all you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
model yeah and yeah first of all you
know<00:00:54.570> tempo<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> being<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
know tempo is being really one of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
know tempo is being really one of the
classic<00:00:57.329> poutine<00:00:57.780> nike<00:00:58.530> silo<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.829> via

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
classic poutine nike silo and that via

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
classic poutine nike silo and that via
one<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> feedback<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.750> legend<00:01:04.530> three

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
one of the feedback on legend three

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390 
one of the feedback on legend three
looked<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:06.049> boot<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.290> 30<00:01:07.680> years<00:01:07.920> old<00:01:08.220> oh

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
looked like a boot from 30 years old oh

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.929 
looked like a boot from 30 years old oh
yeah<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.409> one<00:01:10.409> reason<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
yeah and one reason is because of the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.499 
yeah and one reason is because of the
fall<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.420> tongue<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.850> as<00:01:14.850> far<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.210> their

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
fall over tongue and as far as their

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.380 
fall over tongue and as far as their
feedback<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.710> his<00:01:17.040> load<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.729> consumer

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
feedback we we got his load up consumer

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.010 
feedback we we got his load up consumer
chopping<00:01:19.290> off<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> tongue

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
chopping off or put the tongue

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
chopping off or put the tongue
underneath<00:01:22.020> oh<00:01:22.229> yeah<00:01:22.530> nice<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.430> yeah<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
underneath oh yeah nice you know yeah so

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.859 
underneath oh yeah nice you know yeah so
again<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.009> time<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.869> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
again probably it was time to really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.429 
again probably it was time to really
remove<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> simple<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
remove it and just make it simple and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
remove it and just make it simple and
then<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.369> reduce<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> way<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.750> also

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
then you know reduce the way and also

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.980 
then you know reduce the way and also
more<00:01:35.070> comfortable<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> ankle<00:01:36.810> area

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
more comfortable around the ankle area

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
more comfortable around the ankle area
yeah<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.390> also<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.990> look<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> plate

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
yeah and also if you look at the plate

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.929 
yeah and also if you look at the plate
as<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.200> being<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.740> konechno<00:01:44.670> on

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
as well it it's being all konechno on

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.770 
as well it it's being all konechno on
the<00:01:45.630> legend<00:01:45.990> three<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:46.860> except<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.280> these

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
the legend three well except for these

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
the legend three well except for these
mid<00:01:48.780> studs<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> heal<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.729> rest<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> all

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
mid studs and heal but the rest is all

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
mid studs and heal but the rest is all
simple<00:01:51.720> every<00:01:52.710> single<00:01:53.040> same<00:01:53.840> design<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.219> we

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
simple every single same design but we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.630 
simple every single same design but we
really<00:01:56.610> focus<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.990> performance<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.920> every

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
really focus on the performance of every

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.899 
really focus on the performance of every
are<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.689> penetration<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.799> cutting<00:02:02.700> move

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
are you know penetration to cutting move

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.859 
are you know penetration to cutting move
to<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> stuff<00:02:03.960> pressure<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:05.759> four<00:02:06.210> have

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to the stuff pressure so those four have

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.350 
to the stuff pressure so those four have
a<00:02:06.930> smaller<00:02:07.829> tip<00:02:08.179> for<00:02:09.179> better<00:02:09.869> penetration<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
a smaller tip for better penetration and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.090 
a smaller tip for better penetration and
release

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
release

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.570 
release
and<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:14.120> lateral<00:02:14.420> side<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.590> see<00:02:15.890> it's

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
and the lateral side and you see it's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.370 
and the lateral side and you see it's
kinda<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.480> not<00:02:17.810> true<00:02:18.080> circle<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.080> is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
kinda it's not true circle so this is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.290 
kinda it's not true circle so this is
kind<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.710> helping<00:02:22.100> for<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.460> cutting<00:02:22.790> motion

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
kind of helping for the cutting motion

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.160 
kind of helping for the cutting motion
and<00:02:23.780> these<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:26.420> kind<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.660> hard<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> tell

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
and these are it's kind of hard to tell

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.890 
and these are it's kind of hard to tell
but<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.770> bigger<00:02:28.190> base<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:29.090> reduce<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.660> stuff

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
but the bigger base to reduce the stuff

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.040 
but the bigger base to reduce the stuff
pressure<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.070> again<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:32.000> kind<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.780> thought

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
pressure so again we kind of thought

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.240 
pressure so again we kind of thought
through<00:02:34.120> every<00:02:35.120> single<00:02:35.330> studs<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.380> almost

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
through every single studs to be almost

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.940 
through every single studs to be almost
perfect<00:02:37.580> okay<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.600> every<00:02:39.020> movement<00:02:39.290> yeah<00:02:39.740> so
