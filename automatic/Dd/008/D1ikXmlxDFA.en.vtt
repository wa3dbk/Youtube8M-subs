long<00:01:59.159> hair<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.270> hard<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> maintain

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
long hair it's just too hard to maintain

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.399 
long hair it's just too hard to maintain
and<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.880> easier<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> wear<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> wig<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and it was easier to wear the wig it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.810 
and it was easier to wear the wig it
just<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> gets<00:02:04.950> cut<00:02:05.130> down<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> whole<00:02:05.640> process

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
just it gets cut down the whole process

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.050 
just it gets cut down the whole process
of<00:02:06.149> getting<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:07.369> into<00:02:08.369> character<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
of getting into into character and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
of getting into into character and
allowed<00:02:09.599> us<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> focus<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.950> performance

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
allowed us to focus on on performance

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
allowed us to focus on on performance
and<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.940> well

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
and as well

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.100 
and as well
um<00:02:12.550> as<00:02:13.060> well<00:02:13.210> as<00:02:13.270> its<00:02:13.450> each<00:02:13.690> individual

the<00:02:32.950> dark<00:02:33.370> night<00:02:33.670> midnight<00:02:34.210> movie<00:02:34.840> premiere<00:02:35.350> I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the dark night midnight movie premiere I

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.900 
the dark night midnight movie premiere I
think<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:35.890> got<00:02:36.040> through<00:02:36.190> roughly<00:02:36.430> about<00:02:36.580> four

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
think we got through roughly about four

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.260 
think we got through roughly about four
hours<00:02:37.830> probably<00:02:38.830> four<00:02:38.980> hours<00:02:39.280> before<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
hours probably four hours before the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.480 
hours probably four hours before the
movie<00:02:40.630> begins<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.770> were<00:02:41.830> in<00:02:41.950> full<00:02:42.160> getup

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
movie begins and you were in full getup

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and you eat had even created your own

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.650 
and you eat had even created your own
hexagon<00:02:45.220> shirt<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.030> everything<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.540> those

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
hexagon shirt and everything on those

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.830

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
lines stenciled it by hand

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.720 
lines stenciled it by hand
painstakingly<00:02:49.840> took<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.200> 18<00:02:50.380> days<00:02:50.740> yes<00:02:51.490> and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
on the way to the theatre and in costume

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.580 
on the way to the theatre and in costume
and<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.820> decided<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.600> wanted<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:55.990> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and we decided that we wanted to do a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.090 
and we decided that we wanted to do a
youtube<00:02:57.100> series<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.690> would<00:02:59.100> incorporate

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
youtube series that would incorporate

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.750 
youtube series that would incorporate
the<00:03:00.430> Joker<00:03:00.640> character<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.890> after<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.250> after

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the Joker character and after the after

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.450 
the Joker character and after the after
the<00:03:03.850> crowd<00:03:04.030> reactions<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.830> felt<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.310> had

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
the crowd reactions we felt like we had

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.250 
the crowd reactions we felt like we had
we<00:03:06.670> had<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.820> story<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.150> tell<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.600> was<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
we had a story to tell and it was the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.810 
we had a story to tell and it was the
time<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.680> didn't<00:03:08.890> know<00:03:08.980> where<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.610> Joker

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
time we didn't know where the Joker

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.100 
time we didn't know where the Joker
character<00:03:10.120> would<00:03:10.210> end<00:03:10.330> up<00:03:10.510> by<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.810> end<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
character would end up by the end of the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.350 
character would end up by the end of the
movie<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.890> had<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.100> sort<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> movie

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
movie so we had to sort of see the movie

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.730 
movie so we had to sort of see the movie
before<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.780> started<00:03:14.020> writing<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.380> think<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
before we started writing I think that

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.140 
before we started writing I think that
was<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.370> think<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.670> was<00:03:15.850> probably<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
was the I think that was probably the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.110 
was the I think that was probably the
key<00:03:16.690> moment<00:03:17.110> -<00:03:17.380> okay<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.730> visually<00:03:19.360> people<00:03:21.120> we

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
key moment - okay you visually people we

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.970 
key moment - okay you visually people we
can<00:03:22.330> kind<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.720> move<00:03:23.080> forward<00:03:23.140> yeah<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.860> was<00:03:23.950> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
can kind of move forward yeah it was a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.680 
can kind of move forward yeah it was a
confidence<00:03:24.459> boost<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.820> was<00:03:24.910> oh<00:03:25.060> yeah<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:25.540> can

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
confidence boost it was oh yeah we can

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.860 
confidence boost it was oh yeah we can
we<00:03:25.930> can<00:03:26.050> do<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.230> we<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.770> do<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.220> and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
we can do this we have to do this and

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.000 
we can do this we have to do this and
then<00:03:28.870> within<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.410> next<00:03:29.560> couple<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.860> days

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
then within the next couple of days

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.540 
then within the next couple of days
started<00:03:30.400> started<00:03:30.820> writing<00:03:31.120> out<00:03:32.550> episode

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
started started writing out episode

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.150 
started started writing out episode
ideas<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.270> think<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.510> became<00:03:35.130> clear<00:03:36.130> very

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
ideas and I think it became clear very

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.040 
ideas and I think it became clear very
early<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.790> we<00:03:37.239> didn't<00:03:37.540> want<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.900> just

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
early on that we didn't want it to just

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.560 
early on that we didn't want it to just
be<00:03:38.200> random<00:03:38.760> blogs<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:40.120> didn't<00:03:40.270> want<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.450> just

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
be random blogs we didn't want to just

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.360 
be random blogs we didn't want to just
be<00:03:40.810> Joker<00:03:41.140> from<00:03:41.260> Arkham<00:03:41.590> having<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.980> good<00:03:42.100> time

be Joker from Arkham having a good time

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.970 
be Joker from Arkham having a good time

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
we wanted it to be that with and with an

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.650 
we wanted it to be that with and with an
episodic<00:03:45.310> format<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.269> actually<00:03:46.420> have

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
episodic format that you actually have

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.870 
episodic format that you actually have
to<00:03:46.840> watch<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.650> series<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.160> order<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.790> know

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
to watch the series in order you know

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.960 
to watch the series in order you know
well<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.900> know<00:03:50.019> hopefully<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.800> order<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.489> get

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
well you know hopefully in order to get

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.360 
well you know hopefully in order to get
all<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.269> other<00:03:52.510> story<00:03:53.110> elements<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.769> think<00:03:54.070> our

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
all the other story elements I think our

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.400 
all the other story elements I think our
main<00:03:54.550> focus<00:03:55.030> too<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.810> introduction<00:03:56.320> of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
main focus too is the introduction of

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.910 
main focus too is the introduction of
Harleen<00:03:56.769> Quinzel<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:59.080> manipulation<00:03:59.440> of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
Harleen Quinzel and the manipulation of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.650 
Harleen Quinzel and the manipulation of
her<00:04:00.100> character<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.850> how<00:04:00.970> she's<00:04:01.269> trying<00:04:01.570> to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
her character and how she's trying to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.350 
her character and how she's trying to
help<00:04:01.780> him<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.410> he<00:04:02.980> has<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.310> kind<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.000> sick

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
help him and he has this kind of sick

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.509 
help him and he has this kind of sick
and<00:04:04.540> twisted<00:04:04.570> idea<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> helping<00:04:05.680> her<00:04:05.950> instead

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
and twisted idea of helping her instead

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.270 
and twisted idea of helping her instead
I<00:04:07.450> think<00:04:07.959> what's<00:04:08.500> interesting<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.950> looking

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
I think what's interesting is looking

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.880 
I think what's interesting is looking
back<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:10.239> overall<00:04:10.600> arc<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.110> story

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
back the overall arc of the story

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.220 
back the overall arc of the story
it's<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.640> journey<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.060> see<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:14.110> know<00:04:14.140> I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
it's a journey to see that you know I

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.470 
it's a journey to see that you know I
think<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.709> idea<00:04:14.830> was<00:04:15.070> sending<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.030> Joker<00:04:16.239> to

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
think the idea was sending the Joker to

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.570 
think the idea was sending the Joker to
therapy<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:17.290> everyone<00:04:17.799> wants<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.070> change<00:04:18.280> him

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
therapy as everyone wants to change him

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.200 
therapy as everyone wants to change him
and<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.750> end<00:04:19.950> he<00:04:20.950> does<00:04:21.520> not<00:04:21.669> change<00:04:21.910> at<00:04:22.090> all

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and in the end he does not change at all

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.659 
and in the end he does not change at all
he's<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.570> constant<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.289> everyone<00:04:23.740> else<00:04:23.890> and

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
he's a constant and everyone else and

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.520 
he's a constant and everyone else and
getting<00:04:25.120> changed<00:04:25.599> we<00:04:25.719> also<00:04:26.080> toyed<00:04:26.499> around

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
getting changed we also toyed around

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.260 
getting changed we also toyed around
with<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> idea<00:04:26.949> that<00:04:27.189> you<00:04:27.610> know<00:04:27.699> Batman<00:04:28.090> has

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
with the idea that you know Batman has

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.459 
with the idea that you know Batman has
his<00:04:28.449> Batcave<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.240> his<00:04:31.389> home<00:04:31.629> I'm

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
his Batcave and this is his home I'm

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.159 
his Batcave and this is his home I'm
glad<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.279> we<00:04:33.999> mapped<00:04:34.569> everything<00:04:35.050> out

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
glad that that we mapped everything out

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.219 
glad that that we mapped everything out
to<00:04:35.319> begin<00:04:35.620> with<00:04:35.889> as<00:04:36.580> far<00:04:36.849> as<00:04:36.939> where<00:04:37.509> we<00:04:38.080> would

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
to begin with as far as where we would

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.080 
to begin with as far as where we would
go<00:04:38.439> with<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.919> Joker<00:04:39.219> blogs<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:39.819> think<00:04:39.999> we

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
go with the Joker blogs and I think we

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.719 
go with the Joker blogs and I think we
had<00:04:40.300> ended<00:04:41.289> up<00:04:41.349> with<00:04:41.499> eight<00:04:41.830> episodes<00:04:42.279> to

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
had ended up with eight episodes to

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.119 
had ended up with eight episodes to
begin<00:04:42.999> with<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.509> of<00:04:43.629> course<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.129> expanded

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
begin with and of course that expanded

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.790 
begin with and of course that expanded
quite<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.789> bit<00:04:45.969> and<00:04:46.960> it's<00:04:47.379> nice<00:04:47.499> to<00:04:47.529> see<00:04:47.680> that

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
quite a bit and it's nice to see that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.019 
quite a bit and it's nice to see that
that<00:04:48.099> our<00:04:48.539> finale<00:04:49.539> our<00:04:49.960> ending<00:04:50.409> was<00:04:51.039> was<00:04:51.849> still

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
that our finale our ending was was still

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.399 
that our finale our ending was was still
intact<00:04:52.300> by<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.539> end<00:04:52.719> of<00:04:52.779> it<00:04:52.870> yeah<00:04:53.139> it<00:04:53.259> was

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
intact by the end of it yeah it was

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.029 
intact by the end of it yeah it was
quite<00:04:54.009> a<00:04:54.150> larger<00:04:55.150> ending<00:04:55.479> that<00:04:55.629> we<00:04:55.749> initially

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
quite a larger ending that we initially

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.749 
quite a larger ending that we initially
wanted<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.550> certainly<00:04:57.849> expanded<00:04:58.539> beyond<00:04:59.319> our

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
wanted it certainly expanded beyond our

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.640 
wanted it certainly expanded beyond our
wildest<00:05:00.759> dreams<00:05:01.349> certainly<00:05:02.349> didn't<00:05:02.500> have<00:05:02.620> a

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
wildest dreams certainly didn't have a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.790 
wildest dreams certainly didn't have a
wedding<00:05:04.080> hasn't<00:05:05.080> even<00:05:05.199> an<00:05:05.379> option<00:05:05.680> at<00:05:05.770> that

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
wedding hasn't even an option at that

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.140 
wedding hasn't even an option at that
point<00:05:06.159> and<00:05:06.370> that's<00:05:06.460> keeping<00:05:06.849> with<00:05:06.969> the<00:05:07.120> theme

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
point and that's keeping with the theme

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.570 
point and that's keeping with the theme
of<00:05:07.360> escalation<00:05:07.900> which<00:05:08.169> I<00:05:08.289> think<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.009> another

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
of escalation which I think and another

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.839 
of escalation which I think and another
element<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.449> is<00:05:10.860> he's<00:05:11.860> never<00:05:12.099> called<00:05:12.669> the

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
element to is he's never called the

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.140 
element to is he's never called the
Joker<00:05:13.090> in<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.629> series<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.909> he<00:05:16.000> never

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
Joker in the series and and he never

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.550 
Joker in the series and and he never
refers<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.509> himself<00:05:16.689> as<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.990> Joker<00:05:17.289> in<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.439> Dark

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
refers to himself as a Joker in the Dark

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.829 
refers to himself as a Joker in the Dark
Knight<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.219> we<00:05:18.849> very<00:05:19.150> quickly<00:05:19.330> came<00:05:19.509> up<00:05:19.689> with
