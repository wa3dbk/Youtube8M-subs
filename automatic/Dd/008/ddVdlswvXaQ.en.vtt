way for me to smooth out my curls for
extra<00:03:38.400> hold<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:38.880> use<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> little<00:03:39.480> bit<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.599> the

extra hold I use a little bit of the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.599 
extra hold I use a little bit of the
cream<00:03:39.900> initial<00:03:40.380> perfect<00:03:40.739> edges<00:03:41.069> on<00:03:41.250> top<00:03:41.459> of

eco<00:03:41.880> styler<00:03:42.150> gel<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.660> then<00:03:43.590> place<00:03:43.889> my<00:03:43.919> elastic

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
eco styler gel I then place my elastic

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.780 
eco styler gel I then place my elastic
hair<00:03:44.940> band<00:03:44.970> back<00:03:45.540> onto<00:03:45.870> my<00:03:46.470> hair<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
hair band back onto my hair just to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.449 
hair band back onto my hair just to
create<00:03:48.150> micro

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.720 

then<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.489> use<00:03:56.700> my<00:03:56.730> silk<00:03:57.269> scarf<00:03:57.690> she<00:03:57.989> plays

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
then I use my silk scarf she plays

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.030 
then I use my silk scarf she plays
directly<00:03:59.730> on<00:04:00.000> my<00:04:00.420> edges<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.349> this<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.860> most

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
directly on my edges so this is the most

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.039 
directly on my edges so this is the most
important<00:04:02.489> part<00:04:02.730> on<00:04:02.879> how<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> get<00:04:03.390> my<00:04:03.690> edges

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
important part on how I get my edges

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.500 
important part on how I get my edges
smooth<00:04:04.440> down<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.129> because<00:04:05.849> when<00:04:06.390> you're

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
smooth down is because when you're

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
smooth down is because when you're
placing<00:04:06.780> something<00:04:07.319> on<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.680> hair<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.190> has

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
placing something on your hair that has
