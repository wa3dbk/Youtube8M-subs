 But I found was a special order of the director here 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 But it was a big hit. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.110
 What did you say, yes. 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.260

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:34.530
 # Bo difficulties and break something like this to write the abandoned land 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 If you meet a good heading, you 're not supposed to. 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 I'm not that just went all the narrative is another example pops up just one study

 Do not make a noise . 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.700
 Japan has been hit hard by our team's dc. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100

 Park Joo-young's toothpaste is honey 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.320
 Networking was ahead of Japan in spirit. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.460
 The most important thing I k5 prone mentality's not the best I prioritize mental 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.759
 It is also fond of coming to angoyo 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 More importantly, now that we have the basic tactics that we have 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:46.250
 What are the ten style to the game 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.500
 What formation is important to these things. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 And what important personal retreat that's the best part, what techniques 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 Now it's the spirit that can change all that stuff. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.869
 Such things 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 You can come to a higher position than we have now 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.069
 What's in there is mental. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:18.730
 Now, those are things that our players can be very good at. 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:18.730
 I teach geolkkayo by the Hong directors then took the childhood experiences can act without haniljeon 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.510
 Pan had a few decades'm being very strong, with a high spirit of the times 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.720
 But with substantially better right to just hand me that day in 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.990
 There were a few players here who were just as nervous as the snow. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.990
 Ah, so that in any case You had a very rough 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.959
 After all, victory was ours. 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.090

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.909
 Arduous moment of football history, Korea was born first Olympic medal 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.849
 5 ah 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.530
 From the Youth World Cup to the Olympics. 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.820
 Oh, director Hong Myong-bo and his children were wearing together . 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.640
 Well, especially now 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:30.430
 If the same team, like the handful of good players are good players 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:36.970
 Because I am a player who I know, I make the team with these players 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:41.380
 I think that is not easy process, but I fortunately players now, which is the main axis 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.440
 I have been working with some players all the same since I was 20 now 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:51.130
 They did not respect each other enough examples now 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:56.140
 I think a lot of injured players really care a lot . 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:59.829
 So far, what I've been doing so gadaga play soccer the way to the football 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.930
 Even if I look at people, I'll have an attachment. 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:08.130
 Having attachment to the players who live with me is something special 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.130
 I thought it was natural.
