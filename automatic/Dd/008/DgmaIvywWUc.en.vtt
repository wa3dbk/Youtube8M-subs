 m 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.680
 in 4 and 3 3 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.340
 the smartphone is operating based 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.199
 android systems 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.310
 the movie interface provided is actually 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.149
 Sep me processor with a clock frequency of 1 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.220
 and such and heart 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.880
 most performances 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 in general, we have a real flagship 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.269
 another mission their ranks can 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.429
 browse through 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.079
 and do not bother using 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.610
 special glasses 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.540
 The price is a true expert in 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.540
 3d areas 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.770
 our job is precisely that 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.030
 we make it possible to share 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 with a portrait of content create 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.549
 him 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:53.759
 we create professionally 

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.759
 tools and not just the content itself 

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:57.910
 tools to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 percentage of this kind 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.650
 substances from popular 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.060
 became available 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.800
 even when I heard that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
 there was a similar kind of device well I 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.110
 said the ball because it was waiting for the night 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.850
 you can say you dreamed about it 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.700
 we didn't need money like 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.650
 and somehow do something on their own 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.690
 like so left on the screen 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.950
 And the film which filter 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 lets also do quotes 5 we with 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 using a special 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.590
 the program provides and how 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.940
 then this effect 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 I think many 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 I remember such children's calendars 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.190
 earlier technology called stereo 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.490
 vario 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 dram is not excluded that he 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.700
 on the press status screen 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.149
 Rianna such 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090
 prism that allows you to direct 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.889
 different image 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.969
 a little bit in different directions and when 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.319
 these directions coincide with 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.439
 Douglas man 500 people 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.520
 sees 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.020
 and stereo image 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 He actually 4 3 thousand is made by 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.100
 technology super who sits 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.900
 supports multitouch displays 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.510
 16 million shades 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.730
 with a diagonal of 4 point three dynamos 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.139
 the resolution is 540 960 pixels 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.299
 the most important thing is that the crane aids tease 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.099
 uneasy stereoscopic 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.859
 snapshot can be enjoyed 3d 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.619
 video images and even games without 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.329
 she uses 304 any other active 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.719
 points 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.809
 clear advantage 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.569
 screen style not requiring 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.189
 use of points as before any 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.259
 other technologies precisely in the absence of 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.089
 points which are uncomfortable 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.649
 often distort images that is 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.049
 eg 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.059
 and changes color 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.040
 and any 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.400
 the shutter on this electrolyte 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.620
 polarized glasses previously implemented 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.010
 obscures images 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.489
 viewing less comfortable 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.010
 and when they use that not 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.579
 It has 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.099
 3d picture is visible on the screen 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.060
 but the picture seems much more juicy 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.909
 much more interesting 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.639
 the smartphone is stocked immediately days 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.539
 five megapixel camera 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.789
 with their help, you can shoot contacts so 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.889
 and 3d images as well as stocks from 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.369
 republic saw 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.389
 camera control is conveniently divided 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.609
 between sessions makarovym and 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.989
 mechanical box 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.709
 also in beer 3d provided 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.959
 separate key for moving and articles 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.539
 in 3d edition 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.049
 Rostelecom works 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.680
 it is enough for him just the principles of her not 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.900
 changed over many years of sculpture 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.549
 there are stereoscopic stereo 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.719
 shooting process is just two enjoy 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.339
 Lens that are with him a little 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.269
 different angles remove one 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.069
 and the same image under when we have these 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.149
 pictures with foreseeable at the same time each 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.209
 we see our own volumes 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.639
 all long 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.269
 I wanted to finally need 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.529
 in general, in principle, come out because 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:43.909
 the third dimension is because it 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.340
 allows you to get such a rub in more 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.590
 high quality so let's say a gaming club 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 about the general, in principle, any game is 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.680
 simulation like how now life 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.079
 situations gb such rules rub 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.739
 what spatial 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.399
 impressions of food 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:00.759
 and when is the simulation 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.109
 includes where to remember the possibilities 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.499
 issued closer to reality 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.209
 Naturally this is a great book any 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.059
 games 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.869
 I believe that the program potential 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.930
 This device is very, very large. 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.320
 that is, if you then I would recommend 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.789
 to all people who 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.889
 I want something more than us 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.490
 habitual flat picture people 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.969
 who want to get more 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.210
 impressions 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.340
 who want to self-realize with 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.169
 using some new tools 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.460
 which is not yet a god who will find a reason 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.159
 so that knurled 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.309
 on luxury things like blocked then 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.309
 she did quickly buy up the graph 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.469
 there is the tip of the iceberg 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.879
 which hide by given technology
