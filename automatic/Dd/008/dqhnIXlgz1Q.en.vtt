00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.320
 hi guys girls I'm going to you 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.849
 show how to calculate the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.679
 number of hands that make up for 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.770
 to do a little whatever they matter 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.810
 can knit I'm going to use the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.180
 sea ​​that unites us to knit a master 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.850
 a shouting at the felt and he's doing some 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.020
 papers 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.940
 first of all for those starting 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.930
 knitting who do not know too much 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.789
 often direccte according to allen according to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 it keeps a name in enamel it's a 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.780
 dilemma and when you buy from monday 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.229
 of the same in the tic is always the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.389
 manufacturer indicates the union of cities 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:47.539
 it is advisable to use is as well as to 

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:50.960
 light rays 10 cm down the number of 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.729
 mallets only increases that represents 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.379
 I want to take me spellbound lead 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.449
 that hair that decides the site 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.629
 since I was not rewarded for 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.670
 big of the center of the site and so with these 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.880
 young people who go from the CNS bypassed 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.460
 every week i'm going i'm going 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.730
 just go up make it a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.230
 small sample with be my i'm going 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.900
 so pull up the picture I knitted 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.700
 a little bit not because I have not 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.890
 understood basically all he says of 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.630
 manufacturers this instrument need to know 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 that each person when we knit and 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.430
 only left that you are there who has 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.680
 fiddle with him and cloud and so do not 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 do not have the same size 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.710
 so no clova me that's why I'm 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.140
 like that I boasted a limagne 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:52.250
 lifting knit 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:53.690
 there again that charles 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.680
 because it's just a sample 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 how to get them in time 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.310
 to make a lot of mistakes 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.310
 an asset 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.300
 here are three assholes 12:05 am and 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.800
 unraveled we have already undermined chavanoz 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.350
 mn with the enemies with the others 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.830
 factions of kribi so here we go the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.870
 to lay flat we will get our hands on 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.240
 mushrooms we 'll take to m and we 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.290
 Here is how his daughter missionner 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.030
 nadine h in the bathroom and it ends badly 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.990
 it's been ten years that they have for the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.990
 casting is very healthy 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.990
 but if you have something else to do 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 for example that it does not eat much 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.650
 live in the first two parts in 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.380
 the economic zones control the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.880
 mesh or so I passed a 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.130
 complaint in good and ben you take the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.860
 head manage that konami the camera did 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.050
 concluded here for something 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.610
 round wounds and wana last of the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.890
 head 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.380
 you have the voirie manufactures you have 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.530
 the cm what you want more listed 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.080
 but let's calculate for example me 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 in my case neither dots with malignant 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.610
 White it's been ten years so they united 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.310
 had ripped off my recent that I'm going 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.850
 to have driver bang my head I 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.600
 am 56 guinea mali calculation is simple that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.600
 makes fifty points 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.380
 and it will complicate the thing 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.850
 do it's not smell like that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.530
 so for example of the good sample 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.110
 slap a sample with another but 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.360
 the finest and death there is always 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.000
 final chord meshes images 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.790
 show elin has really north and the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 finer and so but denis magne 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.120
 ouali with céline came down on this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.800
 health oms will calculate if I did my 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.140
 level I gave the white line put 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.620
 the same he is like many jerseys 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.080
 so glad the 10 points against 7 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.070
 samples have doubled on this 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.060
 sentinel but I'm going to make 56 cm 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.880
 since it was always in front of 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.709
 domineering but good so when I know 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.419
 is not it matches the world and we 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.080
 simply have a rule of law 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:32.060
 if you do not know how to calculate as 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.490
 we calculate here in shop end up 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.650
 by 50 he divides by this new 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.830
 vintage head or with a calculator 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.880
 it goes faster and it gives you 80 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.890
 marie is so much to do 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.280
 56 years old who must not put 80 mike if 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.390
 I'm never gleaned and that's good 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.850
 I hope you understand that 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.470
 it was good it will turn soon 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.470
 goodbye soon
