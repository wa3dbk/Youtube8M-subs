sub boxes may be flooded so I kind of

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.980 
sub boxes may be flooded so I kind of
wanted<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> filter<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.060> down<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> show<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

we knew going into the show that 4k or
UHD<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> correct<00:00:29.189> term<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.460> be

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
UHD which was the correct term would be

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
UHD which was the correct term would be
the<00:00:29.910> big<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> event<00:00:31.260> sure<00:00:31.650> enough

the big thing at the event sure enough
4k<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.550> UHD<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.989> top<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.440> it's

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
4k this UHD that but on top of that it's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.610 
4k this UHD that but on top of that it's
curved<00:00:35.309> UHD<00:00:36.120> TVs<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.230> pushing

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
curved UHD TVs that they are now pushing

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.690 
curved UHD TVs that they are now pushing
on<00:00:37.710> everybody<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.460> did<00:00:38.610> with

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
on everybody kind of like they did with

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420 
on everybody kind of like they did with
3d<00:00:39.059> TVs<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.629> years<00:00:39.870> ago<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:40.890> Samsung<00:00:41.280> big

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
3d TVs two years ago so it's Samsung big

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
3d TVs two years ago so it's Samsung big
to<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.850> one-up<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.750> showed

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to kind of one-up that as they showed

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.889 
to kind of one-up that as they showed
off<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.200> prototype<00:00:43.710> 85<00:00:44.309> inch<00:00:44.640> bendable<00:00:45.360> Ultra

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
off a prototype 85 inch bendable Ultra

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
off a prototype 85 inch bendable Ultra
HD<00:00:45.960> TV<00:00:46.530> bendable<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.910> how<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.090> works<00:00:48.149> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
HD TV bendable so how it works is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.819 
HD TV bendable so how it works is
literally<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> click<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> button<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
literally with a click of a button it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
literally with a click of a button it
can<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.190> straight<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.879> curved<00:00:51.539> now

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
can go from straight to curved now

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930 
can go from straight to curved now
Samsung<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.250> secretive<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Samsung was pretty secretive about it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.279 
Samsung was pretty secretive about it
because<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> prototype<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.170> was

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
because it is a prototype so there was

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959 
because it is a prototype so there was
no<00:00:55.410> release<00:00:55.710> date<00:00:55.739> no<00:00:56.160> price<00:00:56.399> point<00:00:56.670> anything

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
no release date no price point anything

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
no release date no price point anything
like<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.750> didn't<00:00:57.899> want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> get

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
like that they really didn't want to get

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
like that they really didn't want to get
into<00:00:58.379> any<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> technology<00:00:59.190> either<00:00:59.340> how<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
into any of the technology either how it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
into any of the technology either how it
works<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.149> far<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> degree<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.199> bend

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
works how far of a degree you can bend

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
works how far of a degree you can bend
it<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.609> stop<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.090> stops<00:01:03.390> they

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it to is that one stop two stops they

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.729 
it to is that one stop two stops they
would<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.870> release<00:01:04.049> any<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
would not release any of that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
would not release any of that
information<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.760> regardless<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.330> whether

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
information now regardless of whether

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.060 
information now regardless of whether
it's<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> gimmick<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.530> thought<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.860> was

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it's a gimmick or not I thought this was

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.560 
it's a gimmick or not I thought this was
cool<00:01:08.250> tech<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> something<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> guys<00:01:09.180> wanted

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
cool tech and something you guys wanted

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
cool tech and something you guys wanted
to<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> chance<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to see and I actually got a chance to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
to see and I actually got a chance to
sit<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.520> front<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.000> curved<00:01:12.270> TVs<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
sit in front of some curved TVs and I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.149 
sit in front of some curved TVs and I
know<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> people<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.920> actually

viewing<00:01:14.400> these<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.760> gimmicky<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.689> idea

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
viewing these as gimmicky the idea

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.390 
viewing these as gimmicky the idea
behind<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> curved<00:01:16.590> display<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.130> supposed

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
behind the curved display it's supposed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
behind the curved display it's supposed
to<00:01:17.460> give<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.790> 3d<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.509> effect<00:01:18.869> without

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
to give you a 3d like effect without

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
to give you a 3d like effect without
glasses<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:19.950> 3d<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> sense<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
glasses but not 3d in the sense that you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
glasses but not 3d in the sense that you
have<00:01:21.060> objects<00:01:21.479> popping<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:22.680> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have objects popping at you but more in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.810 
have objects popping at you but more in
a<00:01:22.830> sense<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.490> noticed<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
a sense and I really noticed this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
a sense and I really noticed this
watching<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> sports<00:01:24.509> demo<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> feel

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
watching a sports demo we kind of feel

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
watching a sports demo we kind of feel
like<00:01:25.409> you're<00:01:25.619> surrounded<00:01:26.369> by<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> content<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
like you're surrounded by the content it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.520 
like you're surrounded by the content it
actually<00:01:27.659> thought<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.409> cool

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
actually thought that was really cool

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually thought that was really cool
and<00:01:28.590> enjoyed<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.430> than<00:01:29.640> any<00:01:29.759> 3d

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and enjoyed that more than any 3d

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
and enjoyed that more than any 3d
experience<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.810> I've<00:01:30.900> tried<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.500> problem

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
experience that I've tried the problem

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
experience that I've tried the problem
is<00:01:31.920> though<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.369> almost<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.729> sweet<00:01:32.970> spot<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is though there's almost a sweet spot of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
is though there's almost a sweet spot of
where<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:33.960> sitting<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
where you got to be sitting to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
where you got to be sitting to
appreciate<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> effect<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> curved

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
appreciate the effect of a curved

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.240 
appreciate the effect of a curved
display<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.840> you're<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.140> 10<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.770> 15<00:01:38.100> feet

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
display if you're about 10 to 15 feet

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
display if you're about 10 to 15 feet
away<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.479> start<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.750> appreciate

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
away then you really start to appreciate

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
away then you really start to appreciate
the<00:01:40.350> effect<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> side

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the effect but if you're off to the side

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
the effect but if you're off to the side
or<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.329> farther<00:01:42.630> away<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> really

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
or you're farther away then it really

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.889 
or you're farther away then it really
starts<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> lose<00:01:44.460> its<00:01:44.670> value<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.840> know

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
starts to lose its value so I don't know

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
starts to lose its value so I don't know
let<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> guys<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:46.950> our

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
out of them at the very least I think we

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
out of them at the very least I think we
can<00:01:52.470> agree<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.159> cool<00:01:53.430> tech<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
can agree that this was cool tech and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
can agree that this was cool tech and
it's<00:01:53.970> nice<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.420> companies<00:01:54.720> step<00:01:55.020> outside

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it's nice to see companies step outside

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's nice to see companies step outside
the<00:01:55.590> box<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> whether<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.340> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the box and whether or not it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
the box and whether or not it's
completely<00:01:57.000> useful<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> end<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
completely useful I think at the end of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.899
