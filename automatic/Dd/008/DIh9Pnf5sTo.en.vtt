anything other than start healing

because people can come over to this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.780 
because people can come over to this
side<00:02:26.650> pretty<00:02:27.220> low<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:29.640> everyone<00:02:30.640> has

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
side pretty low so there everyone has

already gone back to the other side
switching<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.959> me<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
switching back so now just me and the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.730 
switching back so now just me and the
tank<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.330> with<00:02:37.570> are<00:02:37.840> here<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:38.500> side

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
tank that I'm with are here on this side

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.820 
tank that I'm with are here on this side
I<00:02:39.010> usually<00:02:39.670> pop<00:02:40.120> guardian<00:02:41.050> spirit<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.650> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
I usually pop guardian spirit at this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.500 
I usually pop guardian spirit at this
point<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.459> extra<00:02:42.700> healing<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.300> tank

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
point to get extra healing on the tank

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.780 
point to get extra healing on the tank
because<00:02:43.840> they<00:02:44.050> take<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.530> pretty<00:02:45.070> consistent

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
because they take a pretty consistent

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.729 
because they take a pretty consistent
large<00:02:46.239> amount<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.630> damage<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.380> tough<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
large amount of damage and it's tough to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.860 
large amount of damage and it's tough to
heal<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.930> middle<00:02:50.170> part<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.970> she<00:02:52.690> will

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
heal up in this middle part so she will

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.699 
heal up in this middle part so she will
click<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.350> light<00:02:53.530> well<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:56.410> will

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
click on the light well and and I will

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.400 
click on the light well and and I will

while the healer that was in the middle
that<00:03:16.940> I've<00:03:17.240> been<00:03:17.420> switching<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.500> healer

will come back to the middle and the

will come back to the middle and the
other<00:03:25.010> healer<00:03:25.310> will<00:03:25.460> have<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.730> focus<00:03:26.420> on<00:03:26.660> all

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
other healer will have to focus on all

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.270 
other healer will have to focus on all
that<00:03:26.900> raid<00:03:27.110> damage<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.650> stuff<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> just

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that raid damage and stuff that I just

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.330 
that raid damage and stuff that I just
did<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.560> see<00:03:33.680> I'm<00:03:33.830> getting<00:03:34.100> fairly

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
did so you can see I'm getting fairly

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.580 
did so you can see I'm getting fairly
low<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.880> mana<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.780> mean<00:03:36.080> I'm<00:03:36.200> probably<00:03:36.380> about

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
low on mana I mean I'm probably about

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.850 
low on mana I mean I'm probably about
thirty<00:03:36.860> percent<00:03:37.190> there<00:03:37.720> may<00:03:38.720> be<00:03:38.750> less<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.290> I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
thirty percent there may be less and I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.350 
thirty percent there may be less and I
haven't<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.250> shadow<00:03:40.490> fiend<00:03:40.760> or<00:03:40.910> him<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.180> hope

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
haven't you shadow fiend or him of hope

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.790 
haven't you shadow fiend or him of hope
yet<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:43.120> usually<00:03:44.120> saved<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.690> generally<00:03:45.620> for

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
yet I usually saved that generally for

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.320 
yet I usually saved that generally for
this<00:03:45.980> part<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.430> here<00:03:46.550> when<00:03:47.030> we're<00:03:47.150> going

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
this part right here when we're going

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.300 
this part right here when we're going
back<00:03:47.480> over<00:03:47.660> because<00:03:47.990> this<00:03:48.140> boss<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.920> doesn't

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
back over because this boss just doesn't

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.330 
back over because this boss just doesn't
really<00:03:49.460> hit<00:03:49.640> as<00:03:49.760> hard<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.950> easier<00:03:52.220> to

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
really hit as hard and it's easier to

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.960 
really hit as hard and it's easier to
heal<00:03:52.490> up<00:03:52.700> over<00:03:53.390> here<00:03:57.370> you'll<00:03:58.370> notice<00:03:58.520> too<00:03:58.940> that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
heal up over here you'll notice too that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.580 
heal up over here you'll notice too that
the<00:03:59.480> boss<00:03:59.740> resets<00:04:01.300> every<00:04:02.300> time<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.780> switch<00:04:03.170> so

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the boss resets every time you switch so

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.320 
the boss resets every time you switch so
when<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.130> come<00:04:04.280> back<00:04:04.430> over<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:05.060> don't<00:04:05.210> really

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
when we come back over you don't really

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.680 
when we come back over you don't really
have<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.600> worry<00:04:05.720> about<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.820> know<00:04:07.850> that<00:04:08.270> like

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
have to worry about you know that like

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.860 
have to worry about you know that like
getting<00:04:09.080> healing<00:04:09.410> aggro<00:04:09.740> right<00:04:10.100> off<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.340> bat

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
getting healing aggro right off the bat

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.449 
getting healing aggro right off the bat
because<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.990> boss<00:04:12.170> will<00:04:12.410> reset<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.070> then<00:04:13.430> a

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
because the boss will reset and then a

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.180 
because the boss will reset and then a
tank<00:04:13.880> will<00:04:14.060> go<00:04:14.209> her<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:15.709> his<00:04:15.890> or<00:04:15.950> her<00:04:16.100> job

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
tank will go her and do his or her job

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.940 
tank will go her and do his or her job
so<00:04:17.020> if<00:04:18.020> you<00:04:18.109> need<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.320> heal<00:04:18.470> someone<00:04:18.709> right

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
so if you need to heal someone right

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.930 
so if you need to heal someone right
away<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> again<00:04:22.610> it's<00:04:22.760> just

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
away you can do that so again it's just

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.850 
away you can do that so again it's just

DPS shows back up and I'm going to stay

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.870 
DPS shows back up and I'm going to stay
in<00:04:32.480> single<00:04:33.169> target<00:04:33.620> chakra<00:04:34.040> here<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.730> like

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
in single target chakra here just like

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.170 
in single target chakra here just like
before<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:35.750> basically<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.440> same<00:04:37.160> thing

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.040 

and<00:04:43.200> you'll<00:04:44.200> wait<00:04:44.320> for<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.560> ads<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.950> come<00:04:45.130> up

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
and you'll wait for the ads to come up

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.400 
and you'll wait for the ads to come up
there's<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.140> little<00:04:47.320> AoE<00:04:47.710> thing<00:04:48.280> here<00:04:50.820> and

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
there's this little AoE thing here and

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.410 
there's this little AoE thing here and
there's<00:04:53.410> little<00:04:53.830> plants<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:54.460> not<00:04:55.150> spawn

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
there's little plants that's not spawn

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.940 
there's little plants that's not spawn
the<00:04:55.570> ads

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.130 

so<00:05:04.670> I'm<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.060> making<00:05:05.450> sure<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.930> tank

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
so I'm just making sure that the tank

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.490 
so I'm just making sure that the tank
stays<00:05:06.860> pretty<00:05:07.280> much<00:05:07.520> topped<00:05:07.820> off<00:05:08.000> at<00:05:08.500> this

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
stays pretty much topped off at this

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.150 
stays pretty much topped off at this
point<00:05:09.740> they<00:05:10.430> are<00:05:10.520> taking<00:05:10.910> most<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.390> ads<00:05:12.160> so

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
point they are taking most of the ads so

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.740 
point they are taking most of the ads so
our<00:05:13.370> dps<00:05:13.790> don't<00:05:14.030> have<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.210> worry<00:05:14.360> about<00:05:14.480> it<00:05:14.660> so

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
our dps don't have to worry about it so

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.730 
our dps don't have to worry about it so
they're<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.050> take<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.200> little<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.590> more

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
they're going to take a little bit more

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.250 
they're going to take a little bit more
damage<00:05:16.130> you<00:05:17.000> don't<00:05:17.180> necessarily<00:05:17.300> have<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.960> do

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
damage you don't necessarily have to do

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.210 
damage you don't necessarily have to do
that<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:19.370> can<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:19.790> let<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.800> DBS<00:05:21.800> kind<00:05:22.160> of
