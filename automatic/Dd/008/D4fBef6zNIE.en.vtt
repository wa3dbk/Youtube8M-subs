about it it's just that a lot of things
have<00:03:33.510> not<00:03:33.660> been<00:03:34.140> implemented<00:03:34.890> yet<00:03:35.130> yeah<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
have not been implemented yet yeah so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.110 
have not been implemented yet yeah so
like<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.720> floating<00:03:37.290> redstone<00:03:37.830> thing<00:03:38.120> that's

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
like this floating redstone thing that's

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.090 
like this floating redstone thing that's
cool<00:03:39.390> does<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.290> cool<00:03:40.470> design<00:03:40.680> that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
cool does this is a cool design that

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.620 
cool does this is a cool design that
they<00:03:41.250> made<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:41.490> think<00:03:41.940> they<00:03:42.060> should<00:03:42.210> keep<00:03:42.390> this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
they made I think they should keep this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.350 
they made I think they should keep this
in<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.020> game<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.560> i'm<00:03:44.520> not<00:03:44.730> sure<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.180> they

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
in the game but i'm not sure if they

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.880 
in the game but i'm not sure if they
should<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:46.320> keep<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.100> again<00:03:48.530> if<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.710> annoy

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
should like keep it again if you annoy

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.890 
should like keep it again if you annoy
me<00:03:51.500> mmm<00:03:52.500> got<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.490> floating<00:03:54.060> stuff<00:03:54.830> um<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.840> a

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
me mmm got a floating stuff um this is a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.070 
me mmm got a floating stuff um this is a
really<00:03:58.110> cool<00:03:58.260> thing<00:03:58.500> with<00:03:59.780> flint<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.900> steel

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
this is a really cool idea of gravity

basically non-existent yeah oh well you

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.660 
basically non-existent yeah oh well you

basically yeah I think they did
implement<00:04:56.250> some<00:04:56.850> like<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.750> think<00:04:57.930> they<00:04:58.020> did<00:04:58.200> for

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
implement some like I think they did for

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.440 
implement some like I think they did for
how<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> do<00:04:58.830> item<00:04:59.190> drops<00:04:59.430> but<00:04:59.700> can't<00:05:00.030> okay<00:05:00.210> I

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
how to do item drops but can't okay I
