00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.170
 So today we come to a new device 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.330
 available in Germany 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 Although not yet online but on 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.440
 to get every case 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:21.390
 the gws 1725 the 1700 machine in the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.740
 inox execution speak 2200 7500 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:34.309
 turns in the inbox I find 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.309
 very well listened to key 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.649
 Handwriting of the vibration handle 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 not in the version like you used to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 like the smooth version but the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559
 fluted rubberized version clearly 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.480
 better fit but already one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.480
 whole time here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 and what on the device is easy 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.140
 Little is missing the click mother 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.130
 The price would be the kik mother 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.450
 guaranteed to be with you 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 even if this is not here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 necessarily a big device but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.939
 a bit more people presidents 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.500
 But also cigarette are important box 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.720
 insert review who in it will not 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 miss 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:40.439
 great for cable unfortunately easy for must 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.909
 I do not tell what happens when you do 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.619
 the upright rich field again 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.990
 messed not reinwerfen somewhere 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.670
 fall anyway falls against the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.430
 normal craftsmen have suitcase states 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 had a nice on night 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 it has not been understood until today 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.320
 that even with these deposits reasonable 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740
 to integrate 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.100
 otherwise said a lot here 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.690
 deep and no waste of space 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.980
 that will decide that again 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 you almost once in a while 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.220
 already broken four times 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.770
 I do not know how to do it today 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
 did not manage this sensibly too 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.620
 so do not make the first or 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.459
 second touch 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.440
 that went broke it is the one I know 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.790
 not how many of the generations of box 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.500
 Inserts for an angle grinder 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.300
 until today one has managed one 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.959
 reasonable to construct there 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:42.980
 my teacher would always be in this case 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:46.750
 6 and will be so important to you 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 the dish itself is the real thing 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.720
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, only two can do that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:01.940
 generations I used in berlin 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:06.580
 this is the 1425 ce so are up 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.570
 identical to a few millimeters, though 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.880
 just three and just more 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.400
 Air vents significantly larger 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.920
 with this device ventilation introductions 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.760
 Rear also a little enlarged again 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.570
 the wonderfully hidden speed controller 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.760
 I think that's extremely good because it's not 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.500
 chance of company against many to come 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.959
 yes, these devices will be with 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.010
 too unwieldy would be too big one takes as 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.450
 compare a 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.000
 but you can already see something older 925 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.510
 it's a bit thicker, and it's more accurate 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.510
 wants to know 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:55.060
 in the front area 100 9 millimeters 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.060
 this one here 108 mm 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:05.720
 this one here 114 mm are the newer ones 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.380
 slimmer 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.560
 as the old ones are also something 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.560
 longer 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.620
 what else to say about this device 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.160
 I think the rubberized area already 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.180
 very well 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.590
 especially in this area also has here 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.840
 you come up with a little something 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:38.720
 be construed either as a 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:41.090
 or something was behind there 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.710
 noises produced, I am now just 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.010
 first this one here 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.010
 stelter underscores 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.310
 and this one should be here too 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.310
 start below 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.999
 and even without a disc you realize that 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.180
 This device has significantly more power 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:17.029
 if only because it starts easily 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.039
 to move so i would tell me 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.770
 long years of enjoyment 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.610
 what is also good not earlier 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.830
 so often the hood did not work out 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.479
 changed 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.699
 So here you can also the hoods and 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.270
 the accessories have the accessories again 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.159
 from the predecessor use there was yes in 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.559
 last time or last years 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.020
 every now the problem that I hope 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:45.610
 that will continue to work 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.610
 because that is a very good thing 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.389
 Switches where were still something 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.580
 filigree designed settled with 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.229
 I find gloves a little better 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.449
 in any case, do something better 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:06.379
 because he has this multi that one 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:08.389
 Something better must be something normal here 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.399
 fingering it goes with my show is 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:14.120
 a bit more difficult but I had 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.830
 from the 1500 and it was hardly 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.330
 not possible so also seems here 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.159
 either it was a special model 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.550
 or seems to be the changes 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.550
 to have
