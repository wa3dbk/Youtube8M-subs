open msi afterburner program is very

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
open msi afterburner program is very
flexible<00:00:22.470> works<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.400> both<00:00:23.550> ati<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> nvidia

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
flexible works with both ati and nvidia

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
flexible works with both ati and nvidia
cards<00:00:25.340> doesn't<00:00:26.340> matter<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.609> your<00:00:26.730> card<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.060> an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
cards doesn't matter if your card is an

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.310 
cards doesn't matter if your card is an
msi<00:00:27.750> brand<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.410> will<00:00:28.619> work<00:00:28.830> either<00:00:29.070> way<00:00:30.320> so

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
msi brand it will work either way so

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.730 
msi brand it will work either way so
let's<00:00:31.529> start<00:00:31.650> by<00:00:31.769> opening<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.770 

so<00:00:43.340> right<00:00:43.970> off<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.240> back<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.450> can<00:00:44.660> see

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
so right off the back you can see

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.640 
so right off the back you can see
there's<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:46.060> core<00:00:47.060> voltage<00:00:47.270> up<00:00:47.660> there<00:00:47.840> leave

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
there's the core voltage up there leave

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.840 
there's the core voltage up there leave
that<00:00:48.680> alone<00:00:48.890> unless<00:00:49.430> you're<00:00:49.610> doing<00:00:49.790> an

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
that alone unless you're doing an

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.960 
that alone unless you're doing an
extreme<00:00:50.240> overclock<00:00:51.310> so<00:00:52.310> i<00:00:52.340> recommend<00:00:52.640> stay

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
extreme overclock so i recommend stay

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.960 
extreme overclock so i recommend stay
away<00:00:53.120> from<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:53.860> so<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.340> under<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.670> you

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
away from that so right under that you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.290 
away from that so right under that you
have<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.360> poor<00:00:57.200> frequency<00:00:57.880> this<00:00:58.880> frequency

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
have the poor frequency this frequency

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.630 
have the poor frequency this frequency
will<00:00:59.600> tell<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.080> how<00:01:00.440> faster<00:01:01.250> beta<00:01:01.430> cars

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
will tell you how faster beta cars

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.120 
will tell you how faster beta cars
running<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.810> will<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.050> same<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.470> both<00:01:03.500> nvidia

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
running it will be same on both nvidia

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.380 
running it will be same on both nvidia
and<00:01:04.309> ati<00:01:04.460> cards<00:01:06.700> right<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.730> did<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.090> get<00:01:08.300> the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
and ati cards right and did I get the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.930 
and ati cards right and did I get the
shaders<00:01:08.780> these<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:09.770> native<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.100> only<00:01:10.400> nvidia

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
shaders these are native to only nvidia

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.810 
shaders these are native to only nvidia
cards<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:12.190> ati<00:01:13.190> cards<00:01:13.490> your<00:01:13.580> live<00:01:13.730> stream

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
cards on ati cards your live stream

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.010 
cards on ati cards your live stream
processor<00:01:14.450> frequency<00:01:14.930> instead<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.780> right

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
processor frequency instead so right

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.710 
processor frequency instead so right
under<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.830> memory<00:01:19.160> frequency

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
under that you have the memory frequency

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.170 
under that you have the memory frequency
this<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.900> on<00:01:21.050> both<00:01:21.320> ati<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:21.979> nvidia<00:01:22.190> cards<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
this is on both ati and nvidia cards and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.420 
this is on both ati and nvidia cards and
right<00:01:26.630> under<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.229> have<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.650> fan<00:01:28.160> speed

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
right under that you have the fan speed

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.180 
right under that you have the fan speed
i<00:01:28.990> recommend<00:01:29.990> leaving<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.350> at<00:01:30.470> around<00:01:30.830> seventy

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
i recommend leaving it at around seventy

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:42.240 
i recommend leaving it at around seventy
five<00:01:31.340> percent<00:01:31.479> or<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.320> can<00:01:33.530> leave<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.770> at<00:01:34.040> auto

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.730 

now<00:01:42.850> what<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.120> want<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.330> do<00:01:43.510> is<00:01:43.660> start<00:01:44.380> by

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
now what you want to do is start by

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.630 
now what you want to do is start by
changing<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.460> frequencies<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.890> go<00:01:48.400> up<00:01:48.610> to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
changing the frequencies so you go up to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.660 
changing the frequencies so you go up to
the<00:01:48.850> core<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:50.200> decrease<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:51.250> back<00:01:51.460> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the core you decrease that to back to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.940 
the core you decrease that to back to
stock<00:01:51.970> since<00:01:52.479> I've<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.200> overclocked<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.830> my

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
stock since I've it overclocked I my

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.780 
stock since I've it overclocked I my
degrees<00:01:54.250> back<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.670> start<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.210> demonstrate

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.730 

now<00:01:59.420> what<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.720> want<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.900> do<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.200> increase<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
now what you want to do is increase the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.980 
now what you want to do is increase the
frequencies<00:02:01.610> by<00:02:01.820> around<00:02:02.090> five<00:02:02.480> or<00:02:02.510> 10

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
frequencies by around five or 10

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.420 
frequencies by around five or 10
megahertz<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:05.000> once<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.360> do<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.980> test

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
megahertz so once you do that you test

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.960 
megahertz so once you do that you test
it<00:02:07.640> by<00:02:07.910> hitting<00:02:08.179> apply<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:10.160> do<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.610> every

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it by hitting apply you do that to every

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.660 
it by hitting apply you do that to every
frequency<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.050> 5<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.560> 10<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:16.460> now<00:02:16.610> I'm

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
frequency you see so 5 and 10 so now I'm

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.450 
frequency you see so 5 and 10 so now I'm
just<00:02:16.760> going<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.970> hit<00:02:17.090> apply<00:02:17.920> ok<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.400> going

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
just going to hit apply ok now I'm going

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.340 
just going to hit apply ok now I'm going

now<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.360> software<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:37.930> open<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.760> can

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
now that the software is open you can

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.680 
now that the software is open you can
see<00:02:40.090> multiples<00:02:40.680> inputs<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:43.269> might<00:02:43.450> want<00:02:43.629> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
see multiples inputs you might want to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.649 
see multiples inputs you might want to
change<00:02:43.900> all<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.200> them<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.769> your<00:02:44.980> preferences

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
change all of them to your preferences

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.229 
change all of them to your preferences

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
so max out all the settings to stress

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.630

here is look for artifacts artifacts are

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.670 
here is look for artifacts artifacts are
pretty<00:03:01.360> much<00:03:01.480> these<00:03:01.629> little<00:03:01.930> white<00:03:02.110> dots<00:03:02.440> that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
pretty much these little white dots that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.380 
pretty much these little white dots that
look<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.010> snow<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.640> they<00:03:03.970> appear<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:04.360> your

working<00:03:06.459> too<00:03:06.579> hard<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.200> find<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.709> by

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
working too hard you can find out by

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.460 
working too hard you can find out by

Maasai combustor and as soon as you

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.300 
Maasai combustor and as soon as you
start<00:03:15.370> seeing<00:03:15.549> those<00:03:16.319> artifacts<00:03:17.319> what<00:03:18.160> you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
start seeing those artifacts what you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.800 
start seeing those artifacts what you
want<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.790> step<00:03:19.180> down<00:03:19.420> from<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
want to do is step down from that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.080 
want to do is step down from that
overclock<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.709> reduce<00:03:21.250> by<00:03:21.459> about<00:03:21.489> thirty<00:03:21.879> mega

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
overclock so reduce by about thirty mega

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.830 
overclock so reduce by about thirty mega
hertz<00:03:23.549> once<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.670> do<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.819> start<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.629> software

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.199 
hertz once you do that start a software
again<00:03:26.170> check<00:03:26.859> for<00:03:27.099> artifacts<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:27.909> you<00:03:28.060> see

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
again check for artifacts if you see

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.729 
again check for artifacts if you see
more<00:03:28.420> repeat<00:03:29.319> until<00:03:30.159> you<00:03:30.959> set<00:03:31.959> up<00:03:32.079> maximum

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739

more repeat until you set up maximum
stable<00:03:33.250> overclock<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.500> also<00:03:35.650> want<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
stable overclock and you also want to

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.630 
stable overclock and you also want to
monitor<00:03:36.519> your<00:03:36.609> temperatures<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:38.829> keep<00:03:39.489> it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
monitor your temperatures so keep it

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.729 
monitor your temperatures so keep it
under<00:03:39.879> your<00:03:39.909> video<00:03:40.359> cards<00:03:40.870> maximum

so<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.020> can<00:03:47.200> see<00:03:47.380> I'm<00:03:47.530> increasing<00:03:48.460> again

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950

position<00:04:22.139> i<00:04:22.350> use<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.860> software<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.340> came

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
position i use the software that came

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.820 
position i use the software that came
with<00:04:23.760> my<00:04:24.000> video<00:04:24.270> card<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:25.560> lets<00:04:25.740> me

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
with my video card and then lets me

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.450 
with my video card and then lets me
overclock<00:04:26.310> further<00:04:26.669> than<00:04:27.210> ms<00:04:27.479> afterburner<00:04:28.460> so

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
overclock further than ms afterburner so

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.700
