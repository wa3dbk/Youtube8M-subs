 visionary philanthropist genius that at 4 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 I had already made a circuit and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.809
 he is obviously one of our avengers 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.679
 favorites we are talking about issues 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.679
 captain America 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.830
 we are talking about presenter 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.130
 and you are not the palomera I am the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 palomera I'm cynthia from iron man because 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.210
 the third part will come we are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.930
 speaking they arrive very ready to the room of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.940
 cinema to see 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.940
 we have a special on this topic 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 A) Yes 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.670
 they do not remember in 2008 and then 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.460
 ironman kidnapped by about 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.129
 terrorists and suddenly he realizes that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.550
 the own weapons that your company does 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.160
 is beginning to cause more conflicts 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.780
 what month of solutions are kidnapped in 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.670
 the fruit is there with a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.769
 scientist who is going to help him 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.990
 better and because the terrorists want 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.630
 I put together a missile already know that arme 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.880
 a tremendous war and in that attempt to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.399
 iron and of wanting to get out of where it is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.110
 caught will develop the suit of 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.300
 iron man will subsequently achieve 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.000
 get away he was going to tell the companies 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.560
 instance we are not going to build more weapons 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.450
 then this is like it's not going to 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 Apparently the partner of his father who now 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.979
 is your partner is going to betray you and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.100
 then there is a command to create a new 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.820
 mature that is what we can already 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.259
 it is wine color combined somewhat flirtatious and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 then it will become a 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.509
 superhero as we already know the partner what 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.340
 betrays and starts creating another 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.259
 armor because suddenly is filled with 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.229
 resentment fights against herman obviously 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.149
 our hero comes out victorious and tells 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.130
 all the press 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.350
 I'm ironman so I do not keep the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.720
 hidden identity is not going to be a black 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.840
 anonymous for nothing to think that it will be nose 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.600
 but it's fine that jon favreau comes out as 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.789
 happy in movie 1 and 2 and it's the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 brother driver but it's also the 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.500
 director of film 1 and 2 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.500
 commanded it premiered in 2010 and this 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.780
 movie is very important because it's going to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 precede the avengers a little 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.200
 same as captain america but the most 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.560
 important is that we're going to see nick 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.720
 thierry and black widow 'we are going to see them 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.010
 together in this movie because it turns out 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.599
 that our hero has some 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.849
 problems with the palace he has here 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.680
 embedded and then he does not want him 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.150
 say pepper potts because he does not want you 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.040
 worry because you already know that having there 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.370
 as their romance not a declared but 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 they have something suddenly we see a 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.470
 scientist in russia who wants to avenge 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.420
 like family status because I never know 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.480
 gave him the recognition since the father 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.120
 of this Russian worked with the father to his 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.250
 instead of ironman, it's jaguar 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.829
 you know then you want to avenge death 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.750
 of this man looking for hero nadal no 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.430
 wants to destroy brother is in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.079
 conditions to fight 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.940
 nixon and visit him tells you to see by 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.440
 please concentrate you need to fix 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 this word that you have the whole heart 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.650
 you have to fix that because if not, 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.870
 you'll 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.730
 in order to survive we need for a 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.060
 important project still for the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.400
 Avengers but we do not know about 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.700
 somehow the good in some way 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.349
 thanks to the lesson help and achieve 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.689
 find how it is that one can 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.240
 survive without that palace so that 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:37.020
 makes a triangle of power 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.610
 and good ironman comes out victorious 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.380
 obviously and most importantly the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.960
 movie is that they finally arrive and that 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.360
 one tells you we do not need as a consultant 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.610
 of the best but not necessarily 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.740
 as a member because you're not there 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.480
 necessarily trained but if you 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.670
 We want to make collaboration 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.220
 and so the second movie ends on 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.770
 rudy character is played in the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.800
 movie by actor terrence howard 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.950
 but in sequels 2 and 3 the character 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.220
 Don makes ChamÃ­n but that all iron 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.220
 man 3 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.820
 the brilliant tom staggs will face a 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.470
 enemy that knows no limits then 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.290
 when she understands that he is a friend 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.970
 destroyed all the personal universes 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.770
 will undertake a search to find 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.770
 responsible and will make a trip 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.360

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.520
