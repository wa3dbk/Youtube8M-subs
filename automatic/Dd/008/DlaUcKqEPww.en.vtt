00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
think is interesting that will show up
in<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.880> featured<00:01:45.240> list<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.649> could

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
in my featured list and then I could

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
in my featured list and then I could
build<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.039> own<00:01:47.130> list<00:01:47.459> so<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> queue<00:01:48.420> I'm

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
build my own list so and the queue I'm

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
build my own list so and the queue I'm
selecting<00:01:49.709> things<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> put<00:01:50.729> into

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
selecting things that I want to put into

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.309 
selecting things that I want to put into
the<00:01:50.969> queue<00:01:51.209> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
the queue so I can do them so for

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.380 
the queue so I can do them so for
example<00:01:55.709> we'll<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.609> into<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> apps

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
example we'll go into some of the apps

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
example we'll go into some of the apps
here<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.609> all<00:01:59.609> of<00:01:59.670> these<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.060> people<00:02:00.600> desk<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
here and all of these are people desk so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
here and all of these are people desk so
you<00:02:01.109> don't<00:02:01.289> have<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.039> find<00:02:02.310> ants

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you don't have to go out and find ants

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
you don't have to go out and find ants
you<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.599> find<00:02:03.840> content<00:02:04.289> we're

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you don't have to find content we're

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
you don't have to find content we're
making<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.399> accessible<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> by

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
making these accessible to you by

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.469 
making these accessible to you by
arrangement<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.039> doing<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.060> saves

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
arrangement that we're doing so it saves

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
arrangement that we're doing so it saves
you<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.899> work<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.769> makes<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> very

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
you a lot of work it just makes it very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
you a lot of work it just makes it very
accessible<00:02:11.700> easy<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.390> navigate<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.500> brings

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
accessible easy to navigate and brings

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
accessible easy to navigate and brings
lots<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.430> into<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.810> example

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
lots of this into so this is for example

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.020 
lots of this into so this is for example
we're<00:02:16.230> gonna<00:02:16.290> say<00:02:16.590> I'm<00:02:17.129> gonna<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.640> entire

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
we're gonna say I'm gonna see the entire

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380 
we're gonna say I'm gonna see the entire
app<00:02:18.360> content<00:02:19.049> library<00:02:19.650> there's<00:02:20.459> over<00:02:20.730> 200

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
app content library there's over 200

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.780 
app content library there's over 200
list<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.290> building<00:02:22.680> by<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.829> time<00:02:23.129> we<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
list is building by the time we and you

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
list is building by the time we and you
know<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.329> this<00:02:24.540> many<00:02:24.810> now<00:02:25.049> because<00:02:25.410> yet

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
know you have this many now because yet

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.229 
know you have this many now because yet
this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.129> almost<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.610> second<00:02:27.060> generation

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
this is almost like a second generation

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
this is almost like a second generation
for<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> guess<00:02:28.049> you've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.010> software

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
lunches and it's 19 in November yeah

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.670 
lunches and it's 19 in November yeah
there's<00:02:42.900> gonna<00:02:43.019> be<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.139> lot<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.319> really<00:02:43.530> great

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
there's gonna be a lot of really great

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.129 
there's gonna be a lot of really great
stuff<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> shortened

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
stuff so if I you know it's a shortened

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.170 
stuff so if I you know it's a shortened
by<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.500> expect<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.889> lot<00:02:47.040> more<00:02:47.069> than<00:02:47.400> 200<00:02:47.970> all

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
by we can expect a lot more than 200 all

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.380 
by we can expect a lot more than 200 all
that's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
that's

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.260 
that's
so<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.110> shorten<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.590> list<00:02:50.830> from<00:02:51.070> 200<00:02:51.700> down

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
so I can shorten that list from 200 down

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.770 
so I can shorten that list from 200 down
to<00:02:52.570> I'll<00:02:53.350> say<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:54.190> apps<00:02:54.430> I'd<00:02:54.670> pick<00:02:54.970> 21<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.660> this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
to I'll say my apps I'd pick 21 in this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.630 
to I'll say my apps I'd pick 21 in this
case<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.470> makes<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.830> easier<00:02:57.070> for<00:02:57.130> me<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> find

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
case it makes it easier for me to find

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.270 
case it makes it easier for me to find
things<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.300> if<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.930> want<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.380> can<00:02:59.680> go<00:02:59.800> ahead<00:02:59.920> and

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
things and if I want I can go ahead and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.670 
things and if I want I can go ahead and
make<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> search<00:03:00.850> by<00:03:01.150> name<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.410> make<00:03:02.530> this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
make a search by name and to make this

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500 
make a search by name and to make this
really<00:03:02.920> easy<00:03:03.070> instead<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.820> having<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.270> rely<00:03:04.390> on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
really easy instead of having to rely on

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.600 
really easy instead of having to rely on
the<00:03:04.780> cursor<00:03:05.200> keys<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.100> gonna<00:03:06.250> flip<00:03:06.460> this

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the cursor keys I'm gonna flip this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.880 
the cursor keys I'm gonna flip this
remote<00:03:06.940> control<00:03:07.330> over<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> back<00:03:07.960> side<00:03:08.200> we
