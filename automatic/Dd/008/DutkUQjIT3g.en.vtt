 a big Parisian shop facing the sea 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.409
 and he did not get dressed in apple costumes and she smiled 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.190
 and put women's heads 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.910

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.600
 famous who is there

 julia de mambé was thrown 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.910
 this museum that even bought the rights of these two sectors 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.850
 of these posters to make products 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.670
 luxury derivatives 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 which are sold at airports and at the tour shop 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.210
 he worked for great couturiers like north fans balenciaga 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.690
 then 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 he was doing a pinup every week for paris fla paris online 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.160
 what else 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.780
 at one point actually but for big brands like 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 a strip search deleted 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.880
 the blacklist 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.020
 but lately there have been precisely 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.699
 an exhibition 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.579
 we see a poster in front of Marie 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.159
 do not feel alcohol 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.109
 what is really the one that has been put forward thanks to his texts in 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.109
 this exhibition at the louvre museum 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.219
 and then that acrylic painting 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.009
 very busy 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.009
 and so that the painting was still 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.039
 there were brokers who will guide worldwide he was 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.389
 in the United States was guest of honor in Russia 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.139
 in Japan we will accept 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.949
 know that I was the second wife of my husband can not 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.359
 so that I had known how 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.079
 we lived together for ten years 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.639
 obvious that I believe that 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.540
 announced 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.549
 it's good also to choose to be me I'm 10 and models for them 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.949
 and then I do not know the feminine beauty 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 it is shared the pot of glue by both men and women 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 facing some more complicated cases for his first perfect race 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.519
 anna massey telescope 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 we were scared 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.720
 esther joly which last week and faded the projection of the posters that 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.679
 had been handmade 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.539
 and it's true that it still bothers me because I said 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.029
 he's still here by the way we've signed a protocol and 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.279
 these protocols this year with 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.159
 the last two years with national education 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.159
 and my husband's work is taught 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.669
 and there are big houses like new images 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.210
 his team of artists 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.210
 important 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.330
 the black is that these lands 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.320
 m and it's that the browns were part of two of these great artists 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.279
 black 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 him to make copies of his friends so be sold around the world 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.489
 so toulouse because she has already organized lafite latour 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.899
 and because there are many collectors 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.719
 who are in the wait 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.269
 peace and because the children he lived for ten years so that's it 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:10.999
 reassured 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.629
 I wanted to 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.609
 to see that 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.780
 how how very inspired people 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.870
 and I realize that a lot of Toulouse has judged a lot of calls 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.680
 phone 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.139
 many Toulouse are sensitive precisely this 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.099
 the strikers 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.919
 it's good because it's not always paris 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.669
 he still took to other big cities fleeing Toulouse 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.669
 is a city very sensitized by the 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.599
 and justly % 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.659
 lassana the permit to meet an artist 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.210
 my husband is unknown 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.640
 and my husband had told him he's exposing now it's up to it's this 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.110
 artist is recognized so that 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.629
 once the announced by m each turn a little bit advanced 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.629
 in this environment I think it's good 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.570
 and well the sector including self-portraits that I have 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.289
 preserved 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.110
 and then and then 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.500
 likewise portraits of the air and the first 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.339
 recently married it is very beautiful 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.939
 206 people have died 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.710
 at the same time the same year 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.710
 then portraits 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.979
 but he has a headache of other themes 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.319
 yes I know it's not necessarily in memory maintenance 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.319
 I love these pin-ups 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.240
 he still retains 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.740
 a lot of little things like that 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.380
 for me personally
