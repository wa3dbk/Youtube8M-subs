00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.750
 finely chopped tomato finely 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.690
 garlic cloves or preferably so that 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.520
 give it a much more delicious flavor 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.440

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.070
 do not forget to wash it perfectly 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.700
 to remove the excess soil and 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.340
 disinfect it ok it 's better to disinfect it 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.890
 with colloidal silver is much less 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.040
 aggressive and harmful to the body 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.720
 well let's need katsu let's go 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.330

 I'm taking care of tuna like that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.790
 in water a lemon we will occupy sauce 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.300

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.320
 to occupy it ginger pepper and salt 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.810
 perfect then let's chop well 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.510
 well all our ingredients for 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.350
 integrate them worth in what amounts look 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:37.119
 honestly here it is very bus 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 ok it could be 50% of tuna and 50% of the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.970
 salad is to say the mixture of the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.180
 onion the tomato the cucumber and 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.750
 cilantro ok but there are those who prefer 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.610
 make it more salad than tuna because 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 well I love how is this 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.380
 salad then good is very something 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 perfect then let me chop 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.100
 finally my cucumber my cilantro and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.440
 right now I see them a comment on the fit 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.820
 something that makes it much richer 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.310
 this 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 the onion is the first thing that itches is 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.160
 you put it with the lemon and salt it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.760
 start to disarm in what you pike all 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.260
 the rest 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.510
 then already when they are integrated 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.090
 They are ingredients onion and lemon 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.780
 that is, he is sent an onion give me des 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250
 to call her is to lose that flavor so 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.140
 intense and so strong 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.740
 obvious he still knows onion but not 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.200
 so not as intense as not so dense 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.160
 you understand good then I'm going to bite it 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.209
 everything so that we already join it we season it 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.590
 and they're going to see how rich rich 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.410
 perfectly already it pique everything already I have 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 everything ready then we are going to start 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 and as we saw him put first 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.920
 topple the onion with lemon 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.640
 As I told you, I took all the juice out 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.519
 tuna in water and water I gave it to my 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.769
 cats and of course I love myself for it 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.310
 truth because then we are going to throw 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:15.620
 all the tuna all the tomato all the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.709
 ok cucumber and right now the time 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.599
 perfect friends already integrates everything not 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.150
 forget that the secret ingredient 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.299
 more delicious is the garlic prepared that already 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.790
 teach us to do in another video I'm going 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.830
 to leave here the link does not know very 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.980
 heavy to garlic but it gives a flavor 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.010
 delicious now is the refreshment of 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.010
 orange 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.040
 that's basic because all the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.040
 seafood restaurants put it and the house 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.980
 let's integrate well well well all 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.220
 the ingredients we are going to take a 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.730
 little pinch of salt a little bit of fine herbs 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 a little bit of ground pepper and goes to 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.220
 look delicious right now 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.659
 hello friends I've already turned it right already 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 integrate all the ingredients well 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:10.689
 it is very rich, it remains very fresh 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.360
 Ideal for example for hot weather 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.909
 dry high is very cold but for 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.430
 example a dinner light a dinner very 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.060
 light and delicious and you accompany him with 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.680
 some salty cookies and this is 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.630
 delicious as we see it does not take anything from 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.940
 fat because even tuna is in water 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.820
 The only thing that carries oil is the 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.949
 I wave it tastes delicious and it gives you a 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.580
 super special touch you can
