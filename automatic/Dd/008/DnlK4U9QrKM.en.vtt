00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.200
 room misinformed about oltimers 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.170
 okay test bmw 1 series or volvo c30 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.870
 and excellent score grains 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 euro and cap hello nice that you look again 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.399
 to the car week journal 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.349
 part of the 2014 tax plan is the 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.410
 rule that oltimers from 40 years 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.239
 be exempt from mrb so forest 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.899
 m the vintage car exemption that you like 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.450
 there are 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.829
 now it's going to come to no thinking 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.840
 nevertheless know not look at tax plan 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.370
 that is actually a bill and that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.080
 brave through the second room and through the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.880
 first room so everyone who thinks 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.680
 it is in jugs and jugs 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.060
 we take that car out the door is still waiting 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.770
 moment because it can go from everything 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.540
 change 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 where do you base that on well that is 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.170
 actually that's how it goes every year 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.060
 tax plan must always pass through the second 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.380
 and the first chamber are approved and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.780
 only then will it be in the law 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.280
 but why would you now people there 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.570
 against his well now is something 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.890
 special we are today 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.920
 with a press release 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 that the State Secretary for Finance 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.369
 supplied incorrect information 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 to the room and to the alliance that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.290
 until this 40- year compromise 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.690
 because he has his information 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 based on the other data 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.990
 you don't understand yes well we have 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 his figures very accurate 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.870
 analyzed and what actually 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 most important point is that he has it 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.470
 year 2012 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.810
 consciously or not, we do not know that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.850
 has kept figures and precisely that 2012 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 something special happened because Roland 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.390
 van vliet from the pvv has a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.590
 made a subscription that started on 1 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.240
 January 2012 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 and what the limit for oltimers 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.010
 gradually increased the from 25 to 30 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.350
 years and at the same time and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.000
 introduce fuel surcharge for 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 diesel and LPG cars 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.170
 that's actually about new ones 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 oldtimers' from year of construction 1987 yes that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.930
 securities 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.820
 leader imported fewer cars yes that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 he had enormous effect we have the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 done import and import analysis and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.060
 it shows that actually on the day 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.360
 from 1 January 2012 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.729
 the export with decreases to third 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 about in particular the young diesels 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.310
 because they were no longer interesting 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.619
 to drive and there it went all over 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.989
 government to correct the boy diesels 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.670
 to ward off sith and they are at your beck and call 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.499
 operated by roland van vliet with white 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.029
 with his subscription only have that 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.950
 not so communicated to the chamber 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.209
 Effect was she actually oh yes this is so 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.099
 actually no use or necessity at all 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.040
 more to take this measure 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.019
 So what if it turns out week 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.980
 did not include those figures 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.189
 so there will probably be now 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.019
 asked questions about what what is that possible 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.400
 mean for the reversed no that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.349
 Roland van Vliet is indeed right here 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.819
 he will ask the parliamentary questions 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.079
 but watch the moment you 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.939
 of course the second room for it 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.769
 Patch keeps up with wrong information 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.450
 then the second room must of course 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.919
 look at it again 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.139
 and that will also be the alliance the will the 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.459
 also have to look at it again 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.930
 and that can lead to a complete 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.370
 other measures 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.049
 so all those people who are car 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.999
 who have to wait a while with 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.290
 definitely wait a while to do the work 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.749
 knowing of course all by itself but 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.849
 the game has certainly not been played yet 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.620
 we will certainly continue to be there too 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.409
 other interest groups that stand out 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.449
 for people with oltimers 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.620
 how then that in it yes absolutely there is one 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.150
 alliance of all kinds of parties 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.189
 one of the most important parties 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.650
 inside is the is the fehac that stands up for 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.389
 classic car owners and they have to us 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.489
 looked at the report and said it 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.290
 for we agree with the content of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.790
 your report and we think so 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.099
 very nice of course also very 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.449
 It is important to note that it is the one 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.379
 of the parties that agreed 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.409
 closed 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.459
 now says yes we would have known this then 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.199
 we might not have had that agreement 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.969
 closed and so they also think there is 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.319
 must be looked at again 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.599
 to be continued in the coming months 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.059
 the yes was absolutely ok thank you and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.439
 success with the interests bart went well 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.400
 to 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.739
 we have one every two weeks 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.319
 comparative test with occasions 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.769
 and this week that is the bmw 1 series and 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.889
 the volvo c30 the bmw is from 2009 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.219
 the volvo from 2011 we went for 2 liters 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.919
 petrol and 18i has the 143pk 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.870
 c30 two point zero comes to 145 hp 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.279
 We are already looking kees a double test 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.959
 We also always go to the pain points 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.150
 because there are always models that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.650
 have been on the market for some time which of 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.849
 you can bake the two apps super well 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.609
 best take 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.770
 look for that in car week no. 39 now 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.630
 in the stores 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.270
 remarkable collision news from euro I have 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.670
 the Chinese grains had namely as 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.430
 first chinese brand a five star 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.980
 score with the euro and I have crash tests 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.540
 the three sedan is even the safest car 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.850
 which this year by euro and I have tested 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.280
 is now my growth as a previous record box 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.690
 and china and how do you get it done 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.370
 well that is actually simple than you would 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.940
 think what they have done they have 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.480
 just the the experts from europe 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.100
 boarded to china and that is below 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.630
 Another man who freely saab it 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.310
 safety work done so who knows 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.380
 However, all those who are busy and who have 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.080
 cloth from the ground up to the whole car 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.170
 can compile to his taste and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.270
 his wishes of which he knows so is that 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.980
 car safe and so he comes out well 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.810
 store and they make it a huge 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.580
 statement that I'm back even for years 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.110
 spring winter i was a trip bakel 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.300
 yes and then those crash tests yes that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.740
 that then led everyone to what what to what 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.240
 go and do laughs again or do the Chinese 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.290
 cars but yes that seems to me already 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.910
 belong to the past 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.350
 yes i also think that's just for them 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.570
 actually a spearhead of the campaign 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.680
 has been of they know how not 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.870
 must in europe 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 well you just attract the best experts 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.030
 you put together a car that goes without saying 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.980
 you know this is going to get 5 stars yes and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.930
 if you get 5 stars at the euro i 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.300
 have the the strictest 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.010
 test that there is then you are good at it 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.930
 Europe and if you are good in Europe then 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.360
 they take a piece again in china 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.590
 More seriously , he really goes three hot because 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.250
 I have a vegetable garden you are 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.050
 think along 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.810
 yes, of course, they also have the three as 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.760
 goalkeeper name is called the three 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.040
 she then but it could still be that 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.940
 that or europe and other type arrive 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.650
 but there are the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.630

 are really doing well taking course 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.910
 in this euro and caps korea that is that is 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.040
 really a breakthrough 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.230
 we have to go to the year or two 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.750
 wait before we cores in western europe 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.490
