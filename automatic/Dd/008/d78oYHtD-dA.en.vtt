00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.629
 tool of the page that I leave the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.970
 description of the video simply the 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.010
 they look for click in free download and we keep 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.130
 the file to save the file we go 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.140
 to the downloads and we execute it as 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.290
 administrator and we install it normal 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.000
 like any other program once 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.950
 installed we have an icon like this 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.129
 we just click right execute 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.759
 as a good administrator once it is opened 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.910
 the application will give us a brief summary 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.560
 of the tools that brings ok 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.320
 In this case brings a browser 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.970
 windows files in this case then the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.509
 explorer to be able to explore the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.180
 files also brings the tool 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.980
 backup that is a tool to create 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 and restore backups that already 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.440
 we made a video previously seen the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.050
 which will come out now also brings us the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.410
 tool to an assistant partition that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.970
 is a partition editor of our 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.250
 hard drive we also made a video 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.040
 about that here I leave the video 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.080
 also in case you want to see it so that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.200
 we learn all the tools and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.740
 It also brings us a tool to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.090
 record of windows to repair and between 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.729
 other tools that already later 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.119
 We will see in the video and other 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.399
 portable tools ok see or give a 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.170
 click on next and we will give it in 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.910
 next again and here will tell us what 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.040
 that will install in this case to 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.080
 install some tools that are 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.970
 free as the recuva that already 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 we saw that is how to recover files 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.100
 also deleted the video there and between 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 other tools that is the network that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.940
 is for the internet connection and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.070
 very important system files that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.489
 here we do not touch anything we just go 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.810
 in next and here he will ask us in the middle 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.180
 where it will be recorded 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.430
 the system can be our unit of 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.520
 dvd to record directly on a 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.780
 disk can be our usb can we use 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.599
 a pendrive or usb to record this 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.730
 tool or the last option is a 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.849
 iso image ready which is the one I'm going to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.950
 choose in this case we will choose the 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.840
 option that you want in both is what 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.750
 same we simply give in following 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.910
 and we wait for him to believe himself good once 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.160
 After the creation that will take 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.740
 about five to ten minutes let's give it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 click on finalize and we will have ready 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.640
 cd or the usb depends that they have recorded 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.370
 we have it ready to start it 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.660
 in our computer in the next 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.290
 good one of the advantages of this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:25.120
 tool is that we can start it in 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.380
 a normal bios or in a current bios that 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.990
 have a start 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.330
 efe and that is very important we can 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.800
 start it on any computer we will 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.650
 configure our computer so that 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.560
 start the cd in this case we are going to 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.900
 tell him to start the boot menu in 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.380
 this case in the image that is 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.450
 example says press f11 to start 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.030
 the drip menu below we 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.010
 this window will appear where 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.640
 we will select the device by 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.890
 which we want to start either the closing or 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.150
 the usb once we have selected the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.860
 device by which to initiate the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.710
 tool will start to load us 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.810
 we wait for the 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.690
 good tool once it's finished 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.760

 of files with which we can see the 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.449
 files that are internally in the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.780
 hard drive and we have the different
