just my thought Aaron what do you think

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
just my thought Aaron what do you think
I<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> idea<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.670> great

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I think the idea of it is great

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
I think the idea of it is great
especially<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.780> possibility<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> seeing

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
especially with possibility of seeing

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
especially with possibility of seeing
Wonder<00:02:04.979> Woman<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.399> Justice<00:02:05.790> League<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.240> I'm

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
Wonder Woman in Justice League but I'm

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
Wonder Woman in Justice League but I'm
totally<00:02:06.840> same<00:02:07.170> page<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.590> we've<00:02:08.160> heard<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
totally same page as you we've heard the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
totally same page as you we've heard the
song<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.970> dance<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> many<00:02:09.509> times<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.020> almost

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
song and dance so many times I almost

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
song and dance so many times I almost
feel<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.709> studio<00:02:11.160> execs<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.910> say<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.120> at

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
feel like studio execs have to say it at

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
feel like studio execs have to say it at
this<00:02:12.420> point

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
this point

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.650 
this point
so<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.760> can't<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.150> take<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.510> too

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
so you can't really take it too

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.330 
so you can't really take it too
seriously<00:02:15.140> until<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.920> any<00:02:16.130> other

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
seriously until we have any other

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.070 
seriously until we have any other
confirmation<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.990> great

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
confirmation so I think it's a great

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.140 
confirmation so I think it's a great
idea<00:02:18.200> I'd<00:02:18.650> love<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.130> happen<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.910> I

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
idea I'd love to see it happen but I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.640 
idea I'd love to see it happen but I
think<00:02:20.630> bringing<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.110> too<00:02:21.200> warm<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> big

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
think bringing one too warm to the big

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.560 
think bringing one too warm to the big
screen<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.130> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> lot<00:02:22.760> easier<00:02:22.820> said

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
screen is going to be a lot easier said

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.010 
screen is going to be a lot easier said
than<00:02:23.810> actually<00:02:24.320> done<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.010> rose<00:02:25.720> again<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.900> don't

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
than actually done a rose again I don't

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.620 
than actually done a rose again I don't
even<00:02:27.350> understand<00:02:28.100> why<00:02:28.340> they<00:02:28.670> feel<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.120> such

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
even understand why they feel it is such

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.590 
even understand why they feel it is such
a<00:02:29.660> difficult<00:02:29.990> thing<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> mean<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:32.330> my

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.590 
Wonder Woman you know maybe 10 years ago
would<00:03:13.160> have<00:03:13.220> been<00:03:13.370> difficult<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.000> do<00:03:14.300> think

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
would have been difficult and I do think

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.480 
would have been difficult and I do think
it<00:03:14.690> comes<00:03:14.870> down<00:03:14.960> to<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> fact<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.620> it's<00:03:15.950> a

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
it comes down to the fact that it's a

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.850 
it comes down to the fact that it's a
female<00:03:17.120> fronted<00:03:17.570> superhero<00:03:18.020> film<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.680> some

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
female fronted superhero film for some

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.350 
female fronted superhero film for some
reason<00:03:19.160> they<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.489> can't<00:03:19.700> crack<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.150> code

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
reason they just can't crack that code

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.750 
reason they just can't crack that code
and<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:21.050> know<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.320> had<00:03:21.739> tomb<00:03:22.220> raider<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.700> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
and you know we had tomb raider and a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.760 
and you know we had tomb raider and a
bunch<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.060> other<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.510> know<00:03:23.540> resin<00:03:24.200> evil<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
bunch of other you know resin evil and

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770 
bunch of other you know resin evil and
other<00:03:24.980> franchises<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.640> were<00:03:26.030> marginally

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
other franchises that were marginally

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.479 
other franchises that were marginally
pretty<00:03:26.989> successful<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.980> had<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> female

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
pretty successful that had a female

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.540 
pretty successful that had a female
fronted<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.270> know<00:03:29.360> superhero<00:03:30.080> or<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.620> sorts

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
fronted you know superhero or of sorts

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.979 
fronted you know superhero or of sorts
not<00:03:31.850> necessarily<00:03:32.390> from<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.600> different<00:03:32.900> world

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
not necessarily from a different world

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.810 
not necessarily from a different world
but<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.530> they<00:03:34.070> were<00:03:34.130> still<00:03:34.640> pretty

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
but and they were still pretty

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.520 
but and they were still pretty
successful<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:35.630> i<00:03:35.660> really<00:03:35.989> think<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:36.260> just

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
successful so i really think it's just
