 are or are not quite as expected 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.400
 focus is very clear to us and it is 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.439
 the importance of the Sunday game, the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.090
 means the people feel calm 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.810
 not sure the whole week would be 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.939

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.979

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.149
 against Schalke on sunday top game for 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.220
 us it was a lot about our 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.960
 stories were reported and still was 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.060
 the team is so focused and so on 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.399
 relax in the work because we are in 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 know that it is for us only 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.380
 therefore, a positive result is achieved 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.350
 bring 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.890
 video our goal a really well to 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.240
 100 percent can reach for themselves and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.509
 Compliments to the boys like you 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.280
 have implemented and which then on 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.289
 sunday then too ready 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.659
 do with the severity of the task will 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.450
 course, on the other hand also needs points in 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.850
 fight for the euro league places 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.550
 and we 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 felt for us that they themselves 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.030
 want to achieve and therefore need 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.900
 we also something we our series 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.520
 want to continue 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.840
 unbeaten at home in the spring 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.060
 So stay there are some things 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.470
 we discussed internally with us 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.780
 which we have agreed what 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.770
 we are important in the process of this 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.670
 week the boys graduated 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.960
 as we imagine 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.320
 Complement and now we look forward to 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.550
 thanks to the themes of the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.970
 Of course, week still another game 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.880
 role 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.100
 Are you considering whether to play 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.230
 will continue from step what has for 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.850
 made an impression and what like 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.310
 Do you respond to this apology 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.270
 he is now on facebook because of himself 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 given and yes so there are two three 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.730
 maybe one more thing 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.550
 to say this week was little 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.220
 annoyed such quite honestly because himself 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.110
 I 've done a lot of personal work 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 technically based and very important to me 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.700
 is and that's why I say that sooner 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 normal 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.590
 The team has responded very well 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.530
 Although my thought was that I had a lot 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.120
 more in the team revolves around things 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.590
 which one does not influence so but 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.020
 we have to focus on the game 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.280
 it's important that the guys job 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.790
 then you can do it afterwards 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.160
 tell the whole story that one 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.190
 transfer is okay so far the okay 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.120
 time was wrong and why pleasant 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.600
 for us and that it is reaction of toni 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.570
 which is important for us in the group 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.060
 Absolutely okay how to train yourself 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.830
 Imagine if it comes to use 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.690
 or we also have 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.030
 situations where we are not very clear 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 even at a press conference never 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.960
 said like the formation in the normal case 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.250
 It does not look like that today 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.800
 the case we will be all of us 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.740
 To think about something 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.380
 but he himself has good and professional 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.850
 Reacting in the work was also 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.420
 if you do not know him differently 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.850
 expect 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.010
 So, how should that be natural? 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.400
 in our consideration of a topic 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.400
 is decided 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 Sunday morning 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.530
 Martin is the Toni because a player 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.389
 one may occur before such a thing as 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.289
 It must also be on sunday 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.340
 that's a consideration 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:38.310
 if if I say that's good 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.740
 has trained and the last games 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.060
 has always done and we we 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.430
 decide the can on Sunday 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.120
 other founders athletic reasons that 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.620
 we think that is clear 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.129
 the most important trade fair mood is here 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.199
 So it has to be there anyway 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.000
 Team on Sunday looks in 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.479
 which formation will come up with 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.069
 which players she will play 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.419
 all who are in the climb should only 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.659
 One thought is for us 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.550
 to take away points and the people the 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.240
 space are at 100 percent 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.669
 support 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.930
 whatever the formation looks like 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.120
 So there is a single goal and that 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.810
 is also the goal of toyota that he is with 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 his team 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.349
 where working long he has 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.120
 has felt this goal with the 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.889
 can be reached guys operates 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.690
 or not who plays or if not 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.990
 plays that is the goal complete 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.949
 group and this goal should after the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.949
 support punching
