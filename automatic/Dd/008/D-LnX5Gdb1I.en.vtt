 for a video of their weapons the little videos that is in power 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.869
 that's how we arrived 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.669
 franck leboeuf tracked 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.429
 so when the match you will surely inspired a roommate marcory 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.939
 in the description 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.470
 so you're scared but on this page so you go down 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.140
 after you go in the order of their form 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.050
 39 the end the servers having a plant 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.549
 me what I'm proud to leave power has downloaded 2 a parallel 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:36.460
 these facts putting to them the rsf part in the end they serve and the part of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.420
 his nose of a plan or mark sercel and even file so% 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.030
 he is a walker and it works too 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.830
 so you have to make a mistake so this exchange is there 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.870
 noted to download months 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.650
 g after a fake starlet so I uninstalled before 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.010
 and res for 100 m 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 we need two votes of my time 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.400
 that I will mark an investiture also to download them 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 and you madam you hoped there is art 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.660
 there I do a little elite if the weather colvin 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 that the three parties end up downloading 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.850
 See you soon 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.200
 so here we go again 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.150
 so when we are cold we test and cynical to download then the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 gendarmes were wisely 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.200
 eugenics here so at the end of his actions is all alone all the facts all the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.810
 allies three files 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 you make your cards the plane 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.490
 you do 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 extract files an ok party 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.320
 - you put it you want to do it on your feet 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.290
 and there you wait for it to be an excerpt 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.690
 for franÃ§ois not be too long 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.400
 after market after the site attempt to install% 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.550
 franck desprez and dim and montolieu meryem europe apce switzerland think about it 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.840
 level then 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.069
 so now that this specified camps 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.729
 the highway incident 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.399
 for once a force that will then have to make a video that has 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.589
 take off servers will look for 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:20.479
 headphones at the hague at the time I'm talking to you the servers walking loudly 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.749
 and this famous fesf fillon is coming 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.959
 so I made a small label in very fine 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 I was criticizing the issue completely finished 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.509
 the others are here it's over 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.509
 so that free hand practical aspects 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.989
 cuellar you have it faces brest the pcf and the owl thing 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.659
 so for 10-15 in fact we do not need in a team and right now 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.449
 espionage and one of his profits at which you put in the description of 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.399
 the video 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.919
 heyer the king 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.589
 but if you know that in cognaÃ§ais his lands 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.670
 so that's it going to come talk about me I'm a winger 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.079
 such 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.150
 rowling to pick there because it's already the day canceled 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.389
 so you want to talk 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.049
 to rehash I want to congratulate 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.200
 to achieve this 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.299
 a preamble go back and then 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.579
 after the gold medal for under the ice computer manual 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.199
 you say you're going to have it installed 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.549
 and the roma displayed where you drop it by the wires call a little more of a 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.549
 minute 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 his name is inspired by 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.789
 in this maze david bishop 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.349
 then you go for vast offerings stalking 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.349
 after david african bisch and do it 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.889
 alas you move this app 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.780
 also the sun rather third in the slab attributed the expensive 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.289
 so now here is enough the offering drop at once they love each other 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.639
 Saturday I need to update in this Tuesday mancini comes

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.979
 while normally it will update it 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.189
 while in the West normally it was not going fast enough 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.659
 having amassed a market in a release eight teams unit of 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:18.759
 time 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.759
 5% it's a dinner 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.969
 so what are we waiting for? 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.969
 so it'll be going to the one who is normally 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.120
 you see that the sum all fast enough 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 e 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.309
 the technical details 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.569
 so that's it 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.889
 so here we wait a little bit 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.999
 enormously his ball made to play 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
 if there are not two teams 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 time that he is there 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.470
 the clouds sÃ¨ye and so that the Americans can see it what is it 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.659
 that is happening 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.749
 then indeed congratulate them so create a little cloud 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.460
 in a statement 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.990

 in any case you do not have to 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.259
 my job is to put in the bath a certain way of doing 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.259
