00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.559
 flat yojimbo with shimon today 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.480
 is the tutorial course pabrec course 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.949
 so for that we will support the camera 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.970
 you'll see it's funny and we're going 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.670
 you learn some basics 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.589
 fundamental therefore constitutes tauriel on 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.400
 will we will discuss thing we will do 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.559
 many stages 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.910
 So here we are going to support the workshops 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.650
 anteios back up some needs you 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.790
 will show some movements I have 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.989
 started with the first movement I 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.829
 think it's fundamental and that's the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.970
 most important 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.799
 when we start the course it's 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.390
 to have amortized in particular the 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.890
 roulade when you are told grosso when 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 you skip what's going on there 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 you are in the air the door that will shoot 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.689
 automatically down you show 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.720
 never that's clear and clear 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:06.549
 and so when you cushion not fall 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.320
 here you are the whole body and so you 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.970
 are forced to withdraw when we 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.310
 knees when we do rather huge 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.600
 it's very bad so we can add 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 hands me that's what I was doing 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.750
 but especially more important than the one 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.590
 the seals to fight is to add 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 a panties 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.170
 I am here at the worst happens or I jump 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.600
 a roulade 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.320
 but of course it's not so simple 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.700
 that sounds like 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.259
 I already see a lot of them 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.109
 try to sell a roll 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.049
 and who my dad who have me all 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.039
 criticize in two hours so for that 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.840
 it's funny enough 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.299
 besides against goals everywhere for 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.350
 his 1 offers exercises at home 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.789
 you a mattress then that's small 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 trolls to all even for those who make the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.960
 practical judo and castles relays 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.759
 unfolds to hundreds of roulades in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.469
 his bath of judo the one that I 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.840
 it's the best to look for 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.889
 so soon takeda shit the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.570
 better roulades is the one that 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:02:01.530
 practice at judo we put the arm 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.450
 will pass in addition to having an experience 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.020
 to teach him how to pull up the burqa 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.070
 decide everything 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.070
 Besides, I'll show you one 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.480
 explained you do not always speak soy 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 so that's to pass a wall the most 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.140
 quickly possible 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 because it seems simple enough but 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.349
 there is a whole technique in the air there is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.409
 a second way of doing support 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.719
 to bunches and so to climb one poses 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.310
 our hands we are above 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.590
 now that I wanted to show the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.470
 see the practical part explain the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.959
 part theory with banshee valves so 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.579
 in his little part theory explained 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.689
 actually the fastest way 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.579
 to arrive at sochaux 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.709
 so that's it on the components 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.780
 movement a first part so is going 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.540
 to be at most understands the rain and 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.310
 I feel the problem is his return he 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.169
 is an obstacle their table precisely I 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.609
 would like to spend years at cha why this 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.349
 obstacle I'm going to have to put in 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.090
 second support that the hands that go 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.950
 help the body stay on a leash 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.510
 why not it's because if he puts 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.700
 not the nerves of the practices remain 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.349
 passive g takes there the rain jamie 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.120
 heaslip bled actually that's it 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.790
 that you have to understand his first 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.650
 supports second support but precisely 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.569
 the importance is that this support will be 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.090
 really fast with maps 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.370
 it's just to propel a little bit pushed 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.239
 with a jerk to propel the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.739
 body so I come I believe in him and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.599
 I will not have people supported the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.520
 propel my body a bit and I'm afraid 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.690
 not people 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.790
 after I've seen guys do jumps 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.200
 walk and red heard since you are 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.910
 several supports like that it happened to 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.920
 pass more hurdle new report 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.930
 developers and it's just an obstacle 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.510
 for beginners those who have never 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.770
 do the course I advise them to 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.830
 do on walls and a little bit more 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.830
 low 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.640
 even if there is nothing behind it 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.860
 heard the last 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.070
 this is the goal is to understand this 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.120
 movement welcomed to two assets 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.610
 always hands forward like the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.110
 social charges that is to say to finish 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.930
 you just want a little exercise 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.080
 here is to try to take a point here 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.360
 it's a really concrete subject and 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.210
 bring people back during this time 7 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:28.600
 just posted for my dad the tac it's 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.600
 more to go you will refuse 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.860
 it's after the wedding 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.030
 here
