00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
this is for our friend Bob in Pittsburgh

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.880 
this is for our friend Bob in Pittsburgh
and<00:00:13.670> Bob's<00:00:14.670> question<00:00:14.940> was<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.650> can

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and Bob's question was you know how can

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.230

you make some decals in Word and I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.550 
you make some decals in Word and I
thought<00:00:18.449> it'd<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.630> easier<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> kind<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
thought it'd be easier just to kind of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.759 
thought it'd be easier just to kind of
explain<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.420> do<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> video<00:00:21.660> screen<00:00:21.900> capture

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
explain it and do a video screen capture

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.599 
explain it and do a video screen capture
of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.670> whole<00:00:23.820> process<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.859> that<00:00:25.859> way

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
of the whole process and that way

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.720 
of the whole process and that way
Bob<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> feel<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.890> but

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
Bob can really get a feel for this but

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.640 
Bob can really get a feel for this but

some shadow and things of that nature

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.010 
some shadow and things of that nature
just<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> take<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> time<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.840> through

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just kind of take a time and go through

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
that full bar and play with the features
and<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.500> how<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> learned<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.159> use

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and really that's how I learned to use

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
and really that's how I learned to use
the<00:01:42.360> programs<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:42.990> simple<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> simpler

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the programs pretty simple it's simpler

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
the programs pretty simple it's simpler
to<00:01:43.920> use<00:01:44.220> than<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> photo<00:01:45.180> editor<00:01:45.479> editor<00:01:46.049> but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to use than a photo editor editor but

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.609 
to use than a photo editor editor but
here<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:48.570> clicked<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.470> I

here<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:31.830> adding<00:02:32.130> spaces<00:02:32.550> between<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
here I'm just adding spaces between the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.540 
here I'm just adding spaces between the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
letters it spacing it out and you can

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.320 
letters it spacing it out and you can

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the edge of the field so you can make

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.100 
the edge of the field so you can make
some<00:02:46.020> adjustments<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.620> box<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.340> go

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:59.660 

and<00:02:52.110> that's<00:02:52.230> pretty<00:02:52.500> close<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.310> still

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
and that's pretty close and still

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.090

playing with the box just trying to get
that<00:03:02.220> even<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.510> take<00:03:03.900> some

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
that even I think it's just take some

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.130 
that even I think it's just take some
time<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.410> practice<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:09.300> still

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
time and practice with that and still

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.550 
and then now back to weight and I'm
actually<00:04:47.789> going<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.240> jump<00:04:48.479> up<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.840> four<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
actually going to jump up to a four and

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.180 
actually going to jump up to a four and
a<00:04:49.650> half<00:04:49.760> while<00:04:50.760> right<00:04:50.910> there<00:04:51.120> three<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:55.070> made<00:04:56.070> an

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
a half while right there three I made an

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.379 
a half while right there three I made an
adjustment<00:04:56.490> on<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.789> box<00:04:56.970> I'm<00:04:57.120> doing<00:04:57.300> this

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
adjustment on the box I'm doing this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.870 
adjustment on the box I'm doing this
video<00:04:57.570> excuse<00:04:58.530> me<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.740> audio<00:04:59.130> voice<00:04:59.430> over

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
video excuse me this audio voice over

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.420 
video excuse me this audio voice over
after<00:05:00.120> I've<00:05:00.479> done<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:00.840> video<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.500> I'm<00:05:02.280> just

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
after I've done this video so I'm just

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.070 
after I've done this video so I'm just
kind<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:02.729> catching<00:05:03.389> up<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.599> what<00:05:03.750> I'm<00:05:03.840> doing

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
kind of catching up to what I'm doing

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.120 
kind of catching up to what I'm doing
here<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:07.110> again<00:05:07.320> not<00:05:07.440> looking<00:05:07.830> at<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:08.099> I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
here but again not looking at that I

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.409 
here but again not looking at that I
think<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.580> go<00:05:08.699> up<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.940> four<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.389> half

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
think you can go up to a four and a half

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.930 
think you can go up to a four and a half
point<00:05:09.860> wait<00:05:10.860> for<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.639> outline<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.729> see

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
point wait for that outline and you see

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.310 
point wait for that outline and you see
the<00:05:15.060> drop<00:05:15.300> down<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:18.780> definitely<00:05:19.169> looks

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
the drop down and it definitely looks

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
the drop down and it definitely looks
better<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.680> my<00:05:19.830> opinion<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.099> can<00:05:23.250> make

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
better in my opinion and you can make

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.939 
better in my opinion and you can make
some<00:05:23.490> adjustments<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:23.940> your<00:05:24.030> box<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:25.800> know
