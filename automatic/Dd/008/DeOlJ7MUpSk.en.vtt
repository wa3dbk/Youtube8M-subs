00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello how are you friends today I bring you finally the latest news of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.130
 residence with six 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.430
 how do they hear it 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.580
 it seems that capcom has finally decided to restart the saga completely and that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.880
 let's relive that tension that was breathed in resident evil 1 2 and 3 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.349
 since the veronica code does not count as a game of fear and terror because it is a 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.119
 shit 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 initial goal what they tell me what was very sold and those cocks the code 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.989
 veronica is crap and he eats the eggs are one to two and the three 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.919
 let's keep going 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.579
 it seems that next month of September will be the most awaited month 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.219
 for all the true fans of the saga and I mean the saga behind not to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.929
 the unofficial ones like the louvre art shit or those of the pistolita of the udi 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.460
 that when I played them for the first time I had a yavi's eat my cock 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.640
 pissed off of the pistolita that do not eat the eggs or this one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.500
 at the moment you do not know too much about resident and voices but I 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 personally I would like it to be a mix between resident evil 2 and 4 is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.190
 say keep the camera of 4 and playability but have two places 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.750
 one for each character that would be very good and have two scenarios or three 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
 for each character and the protagonists are Gil and Leon Kennedy 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.690
 I know it sounds difficult to fit a story in which they fit together 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.860
 but it would be the host if they were those two the protagonists do not believe although 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.460
 surely if they take out another garbage more than the pistolita a nasty brack the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.130
 fans would not complain about that lack of respect towards the fans and they would end up 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 buying it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.010
 That makes me very sorry for the true fans of the saga and the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.910
 we were very few necks 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.190
 Well, the babies of the pokémon generation are the ones that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.550
 they give away the money to those of capcom buying themselves those shits of the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.190
 pistolita for the gamecube two or the damn and unbearable outbreak 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.460
 Well I would like that in Resident Evil 6 we would relive all those things 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 that made us want to play it over and over again 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.060
 annoying that made us get out of the chair and that has been lost from 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.180
 of the resident evil code shit only then go the capcom and get more 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230
 shit for the psp and the bitch nintendo ds 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.090
 that the first time I went to a store to buy a portable console from 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.870
 new generation told me the one from the store that if I wanted a nintendo ds and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.710
 I told her that the DS did not want her that she wanted a new one for me and she told me that 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.040
 do not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.870
 that the console was called that way I laughed because I did not understand it and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.030
 Then he told me that if he wanted to buy a psp and I told him that he preferred the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.780
 coca cola and he told me that he did not mean that if he wanted a pepsi that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.079
 he was referring to a portable console that was called psp and I had to leave 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.079
 the face with the store because I thought I was hesitating 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.260
 I do not understand how a psp can cost more than a ps2 and really the ps2 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.419
 he fucks the psp on a horse because it turns out that everyone who has 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 a psp or a nintendo ds is a fag 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.639
 fagot maricón but fagot black 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.639
 although nothing happens since there are even worse 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.949
 there are even buy microsoft appliances 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.109
 disguised as consoles 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.129
 just see the command of this console makes me very hungry I love that 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 Microsoft is also interested in the world of gastronomy 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.069
 I think I've deviated a bit from the subject but good 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.109
 tanco there is a lot to say since we only have this bitch for the moment 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.569
 I say it so that when they see on 'youtube' a video related to 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.540
 Resident Evil 6 directly do not do so as they will find videos of 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.780
 resident evil 5 or the new shit that are preparing the capcom called 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.079
 raccoon city operation or things like that 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.159
 they are not able to do a fucking rim and go from resident evil 2 or 3 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.389
 they have to go back to smoke a joint like this and go back to do another 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 shit more for the kids of the profit generation 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.709
 I'm already saying goodbye and if I find even more important about this 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.719
 expected game then the rise to youtube and hopefully those of capcom not 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.339
 put your two cents back and they will shit at the last minute doing 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:02.089
 crashed as for example that is online or that we have to carry a 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:06.040
 fellow dragged by the whole fucking adventure as in the four and the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.329
 five 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.129
 well bye
