halfway<00:00:47.670> through<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.210> clip<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.720> listen<00:00:49.260> what

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
halfway through the clip and listen what

00:00:49.470 --> 00:01:09.319 
halfway through the clip and listen what
happens<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> low<00:00:50.070> end<00:00:50.220> of<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.460> mix

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.789 

so<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:10.509> whole<00:01:10.689> makes<00:01:10.930> laws<00:01:11.170> is<00:01:11.320> pretty<00:01:11.619> much

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
so the whole makes laws is pretty much

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.029 
so the whole makes laws is pretty much
all<00:01:12.039> of<00:01:12.189> its<00:01:12.310> power<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.680> one<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:15.009> the

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
all of its power and that is one of the

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.460 
all of its power and that is one of the
key<00:01:15.549> reasons<00:01:15.729> why<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.149> should<00:01:16.479> always<00:01:16.600> mix<00:01:17.200> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
key reasons why you should always mix a

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.010 
key reasons why you should always mix a
song<00:01:18.340> with<00:01:18.939> all<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.329> elements<00:01:19.539> in<00:01:19.899> place

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
song with all the elements in place

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.950 
song with all the elements in place
because<00:01:20.770> otherwise<00:01:21.429> you<00:01:22.000> might<00:01:22.210> dial<00:01:22.509> in<00:01:22.720> a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
because otherwise you might dial in a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.749 
because otherwise you might dial in a
sound<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.829> will<00:01:24.009> not<00:01:24.340> give<00:01:25.030> room<00:01:25.420> or<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:27.189> bad

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
sound that will not give room or is bad

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.569 
sound that will not give room or is bad
in<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.270> way<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:29.170> for<00:01:29.439> example<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:30.039> if<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.250> would<00:01:30.460> be

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
in a way so for example so if I would be

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.550 
in a way so for example so if I would be
only<00:01:30.759> listening<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:32.049> get<00:01:32.229> us<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
only listening to this to get us and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.100 
only listening to this to get us and
drums<00:01:32.740> mix<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.310> then<00:01:37.179> I<00:01:37.210> was<00:01:37.420> like<00:01:37.450> well<00:01:38.079> I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
drums mix and then I was like well I

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.249 
drums mix and then I was like well I
want<00:01:38.380> more<00:01:38.829> low<00:01:39.009> into<00:01:39.310> my<00:01:39.460> mix<00:01:39.700> well<00:01:40.659> then<00:01:41.229> I

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
want more low into my mix well then I

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.749 
want more low into my mix well then I
would<00:01:41.500> boost<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.459> low<00:01:42.640> end<00:01:42.789> like<00:01:44.459> from<00:01:45.459> here

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
would boost the low end like from here

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.990 
would boost the low end like from here
take<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.509> off<00:01:46.750> put<00:01:47.530> up<00:01:47.740> 60<00:01:48.280> big<00:01:48.459> boost<00:01:48.789> on<00:01:48.970> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
take this off put up 60 big boost on the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.449 
take this off put up 60 big boost on the
low<00:01:49.179> end<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.679> do<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.860> same<00:01:51.009> for<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> other

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
low end and do the same for the other

00:01:51.459 --> 00:02:07.169 
low end and do the same for the other
guitar<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:53.189> let's<00:01:54.189> listen<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.909> mix<00:01:55.090> now

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.330 

now<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.360> has<00:02:08.539> more<00:02:08.810> low<00:02:09.470> end<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.039> about

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
now it has more low end and it's about

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.120 
now it has more low end and it's about
the<00:02:10.459> same<00:02:10.640> level<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.959> would<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.350> with

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the same level what you would have with

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.680 
the same level what you would have with
the<00:02:13.280> bass<00:02:13.430> guitar<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.209> sounds<00:02:14.510> really

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the bass guitar but it sounds really

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.900 
the bass guitar but it sounds really
wolfy<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.819> like<00:02:16.819> out<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.209> control<00:02:17.239> and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
wolfy and like out of control and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.490 
wolfy and like out of control and
compared<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> base<00:02:20.360> which<00:02:20.870> has<00:02:21.140> really

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
compared to the base which has really

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.620 
compared to the base which has really
controlled<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.400> tight<00:02:22.760> low<00:02:23.000> end<00:02:23.209> when<00:02:23.540> you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
controlled and tight low end when you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.500 
controlled and tight low end when you
compress<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.170> too<00:02:24.230> much<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.730> let's<00:02:26.180> take<00:02:26.390> it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
compress it too much so let's take it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:46.800 
compress it too much so let's take it
off<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.750> release<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.760> what<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:28.940> had

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.920 

so<00:02:47.830> when<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.950> do<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.310> mix<00:02:49.580> always<00:02:50.540> have<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
so when you do a mix always have the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.870 
so when you do a mix always have the
bass<00:02:51.080> guitar<00:02:51.110> tell<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.160> are<00:02:52.190> doing<00:02:52.550> rock
