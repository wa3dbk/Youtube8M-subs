00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the hair from UV so we found the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.819 
the hair from UV so we found the
sunflower<00:00:33.090> extracts<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.350> protect<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
sunflower extracts what would protect it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.440

against pollution and air conditioning

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.990 
against pollution and air conditioning
and<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> olive<00:00:37.620> extracts<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> then

and that was the olive extracts and then

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.250 
and that was the olive extracts and then
we<00:00:39.120> wanted<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> try<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> find<00:00:39.960> something

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we wanted to try and find something

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.139 
we wanted to try and find something
where<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> woman<00:00:40.980> especially<00:00:41.280> could<00:00:41.850> hold<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to the moisture in their hair but

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
to the moisture in their hair but
without<00:00:43.530> weighing<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> down<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.579> she<00:00:45.149> could

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
without weighing it down so she could

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
without weighing it down so she could
use<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.230> frequently<00:00:46.829> during<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
use it you know frequently during the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.940 
use it you know frequently during the
day<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.270> glycerin<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.710> found

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
day and so that was glycerin so we found

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
day and so that was glycerin so we found
the<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.190> ingredients<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:50.969> found<00:00:51.180> the
