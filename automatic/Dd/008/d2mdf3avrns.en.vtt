reason why I'm studying development is

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.000

field I was always very keen to pursue a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.340 
field I was always very keen to pursue a
further<00:01:01.960> study<00:01:02.380> in<00:01:02.739> Development<00:01:03.399> Studies<00:01:04.350> my

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
further study in Development Studies my

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.700 
further study in Development Studies my
former<00:01:05.770> colleagues<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.399> managers<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.560> the

former colleagues and managers in the
development<00:01:09.130> sector<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.850> my<00:01:10.030> country<00:01:10.530> inform

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
development sector in my country inform

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.370 
development sector in my country inform
me<00:01:11.679> that<00:01:11.920> UEA<00:01:12.459> has<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> very<00:01:13.600> good<00:01:13.840> development

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
me that UEA has a very good development

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.120 
me that UEA has a very good development
program<00:01:14.859> course<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:16.509> guess<00:01:17.170> that's<00:01:17.350> why<00:01:17.619> I

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
program course and I guess that's why I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.399 
program course and I guess that's why I
finally<00:01:18.670> decided<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.240> pursue<00:01:19.719> further<00:01:19.929> study

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
finally decided to pursue further study

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.099 
finally decided to pursue further study
in<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.950> university<00:01:21.539> when<00:01:22.539> I<00:01:22.569> was<00:01:22.840> doing<00:01:22.959> my

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
in the university when I was doing my

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.169 
in the university when I was doing my

undergraduate in Boston in the United

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.590 
undergraduate in Boston in the United
States<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.990> did<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.799> few<00:01:27.039> trips<00:01:27.999> to<00:01:28.359> New<00:01:28.569> Orleans

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
States I did a few trips to New Orleans

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.779 
States I did a few trips to New Orleans
to<00:01:29.139> do<00:01:29.289> rebuilding<00:01:29.950> from<00:01:30.159> Hurricane<00:01:30.490> Katrina

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
to do rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.690 
to do rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina
and<00:01:31.060> then<00:01:31.209> once<00:01:31.389> I<00:01:31.539> finished<00:01:31.810> my<00:01:31.959> degree<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.700> did

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and then once I finished my degree I did

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.089 
and then once I finished my degree I did
a<00:01:33.969> project<00:01:34.689> that<00:01:35.170> traveled<00:01:35.619> around<00:01:35.679> the

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
a project that traveled around the

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.339 
a project that traveled around the
United<00:01:36.249> States<00:01:36.729> doing<00:01:37.090> service<00:01:37.450> work<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:38.319> I

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
United States doing service work so I

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.300 
United States doing service work so I
knew<00:01:38.499> that<00:01:38.619> I<00:01:38.649> wanted<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.979> do<00:01:39.039> a<00:01:39.069> development

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
knew that I wanted to do a development

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.459 
knew that I wanted to do a development
degree<00:01:39.789> and<00:01:39.939> I<00:01:39.999> thought<00:01:40.209> that<00:01:40.479> since<00:01:40.659> my<00:01:41.259> base

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
degree and I thought that since my base

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.230 
degree and I thought that since my base
had<00:01:41.770> slowly<00:01:42.099> been<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.729> United<00:01:42.999> States

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
had slowly been in the United States

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.339 
had slowly been in the United States
that<00:01:43.389> it<00:01:43.479> would<00:01:43.569> be<00:01:43.689> good<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.079> get<00:01:44.170> some

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
that it would be good to get some

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.669 
that it would be good to get some
experience<00:01:44.619> externally<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.380> thought<00:01:47.529> it

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
experience externally and I thought it

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.589 
experience externally and I thought it
would<00:01:47.799> be<00:01:47.950> good<00:01:48.639> to<00:01:48.700> study<00:01:49.090> somewhere<00:01:49.329> that

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
would be good to study somewhere that

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.289 
would be good to study somewhere that
spoke<00:01:50.169> the<00:01:50.200> same<00:01:50.319> languages<00:01:50.770> Mesa<00:01:51.279> UK<00:01:52.119> was

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
spoke the same languages Mesa UK was

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.129 
spoke the same languages Mesa UK was
good<00:01:52.479> fit<00:01:52.689> I<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.700> enjoyed<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.479> three<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
good fit I really enjoyed the three and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.239 
good fit I really enjoyed the three and
a<00:01:56.169> half<00:01:56.319> years<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.590> have<00:01:56.770> been<00:01:56.799> here<00:01:57.130> already

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
a half years that have been here already

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.779 
a half years that have been here already
I<00:01:58.119> would<00:01:58.569> say<00:01:58.810> mainly<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.829> interdisciplinary

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
I would say mainly the interdisciplinary

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.479 
I would say mainly the interdisciplinary
nature<00:02:01.029> of<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.450> course<00:02:02.039> even<00:02:03.039> though<00:02:03.159> my<00:02:03.310> main

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
nature of the course even though my main

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.429 
nature of the course even though my main
interest<00:02:03.939> has<00:02:04.060> always<00:02:04.149> been<00:02:04.329> in<00:02:04.479> economics<00:02:05.289> I

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
interest has always been in economics I

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.089 
interest has always been in economics I
feel<00:02:05.649> I've<00:02:05.859> had<00:02:06.579> quite<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.389> good<00:02:07.860> exposure<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
feel I've had quite a good exposure to

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.589 
feel I've had quite a good exposure to
other<00:02:09.280> areas<00:02:09.759> whether<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.149> health<00:02:10.360> and

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
other areas whether it's health and

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.540 
other areas whether it's health and
population<00:02:10.780> or<00:02:11.470> natural<00:02:12.220> resource

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.740 
population or natural resource
management<00:02:13.410> there's<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.470> definitely<00:02:15.069> broader

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
management there's a definitely broader

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.699 
looked into the schools in London as
well<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.720> think<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.109> Nora<00:03:59.320> it's<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.620> a

well but I think that Nora it's just a

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.069 
well but I think that Nora it's just a
great<00:03:59.920> sized<00:04:00.250> city<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:01.209> provides<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.810> lot<00:04:01.959> of

the things that figure cities have but

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.780 
the things that figure cities have but
