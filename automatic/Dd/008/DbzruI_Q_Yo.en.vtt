00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.589
 as handballers always have as many as 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.179
 at the football bavaria munich or 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.080
 barcelona and that's at the handballer 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.080
 just the thw keel 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 of course you forget many gates but 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 I believe the special ones on it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.859
 it was important or that was important 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859
 you do not forget 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.170
 I'm not one of those who says so far 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.649
 but simply the crucial ones 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.120
 accents I 've got it with tennis 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.790
 tried but unfortunately I was not there 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.430
 good enough and wise so that's easy 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 The gate we throw then I drank 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.839
 then just me through and beside the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.370
 Handball field, it may be something 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.370
 special because I am more likely where I am 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.659
 I believe in youth had great 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.370
 talent was also with time 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.050
 to take care of sloppy pattern 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.020
 At some point I realized that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.899
 is not enough with talents alone and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.509
 then it has to be that one 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:16.820
 10,000 fans trained that's mood 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.009
 on the spot is not only quite loud 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.340
 but also such a tingling 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.690
 atmosphere when you have a run here I 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.580
 Do not think that you are alone in a game 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.210
 So the team can turn 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.460
 easy 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.290
 you're only as good as the complete one 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 team and can this clear me that 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.409
 Just raise seven strong players 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.549
 in the field must have to title 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.969
 the sister's opponent, I always believe 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.079
 you have to always yourself 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.750
 motivate and that is not always 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.219
 Simply because 50 games per season 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.409
 so it's obviously important 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.509
 is that you have the municipalities and that 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.290
 my partner has in the background for 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.000
 one is there 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.080
 that you have people to talk to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 Maybe if it is not so good 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.090
 runs and if you are strong partner in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.650
 Back then I think I go a lot 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.850
 liberated the whole thing ran and 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.160
 can fully focus on the task 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.130
 focus 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 there are wide rolls or gates exactly 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.280
 go into the angle if that is one now 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.290
 I do not think that's a good story 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.680
 decide but decide if 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680
 ball is in it
