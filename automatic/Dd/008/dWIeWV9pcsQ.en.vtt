00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.130
 head just seemed to agree 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.630
 Welcome to the Christians 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.130
 you can of course in huge 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 and are very small then do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.949
 can you use them as earrings or 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 But now I have these here 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.880
 Of course we need it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.510
 Glitter because everything has to be Christmas 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.550
 glitter glue either wood glue clock 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 Roger something has stuck and what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 you can carry on then we need 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 tied up and with that hangs up one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.480
 pin and this self-adhesive 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 foils stuff bc fix now we need 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.809
 something where we unlock the ball 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.770
 can 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.140
 get your best such a 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 Shish kebab or a toothpick 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.109
 or so I will not both there 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.070
 that's why it's easy 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.700
 at one level 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.470
 then we want to clarify ours 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.780
 It does not matter what you do as soon as you do 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.159
 starting to make a glitter is everything 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.270
 from the west you do that to someone 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.790
 others at home 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 Well, who does not care about Christmas 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 with such a large area is somehow 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.560
 not so convenient that with the brush 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.549
 That's why I just have to apply 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 a piece of the kitchen was swimming 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.200
 Cut off and brush with it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 there is looking forward to your mother about it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.450
 actually seen what i am today i am 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 young 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 my plan was always when I was not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.189
 Fashion designer will be syncing me 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 just to the next 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.040
 I have a strange stranger and I agree 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 would be determined by the pokémon 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.829
 I always wanted to be born as me 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.990
 small was chubby science i found it 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.090
 super cool because it is always so total 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.920
 relaxed as I clearly ask my question 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 me also if that be a beetle pokémon 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 side that always sang all 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.159
 have fallen asleep then everyone has 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.040
 painted and there were huge explosions 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.790
 and comme il is always so delicious 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.790
 asked 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.599
 you can of course also about 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.680
 It also makes much more fun 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.310
 but I do not want everything here completely 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.469
 mess up 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 but if you just down one 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:26.450
 then i will pack up 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.310
 is ready money we need of course 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.469
 the bottom and you can 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.359
 course in white but make flashers 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.540
 is it christmas of how to make it in 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.579
 silver glitter 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.739
 Now we just find the other one 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.659
 complete with glue and side 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.180
 actually do the same thing again 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.200
 only in silver 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 if you have a little time 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.420
 in between then let the individual 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.939
 then you dry things so he scratched 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.870
 Not everything back off if you are 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.870
 the other side touches 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.299
 with glitter that someday 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.830
 also at such a point where it completely 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.120
 Shit that's where I'm already full 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.530
 is and you are also fire and the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.560
 Cameraman is also full though he is 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.690
 actually the camera stops 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.420
 that does not matter that's how it should be now 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.560
 look like you and smart 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.110
 that's a bit of a joke 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.819
 let it dry and then we have to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.799
 now times the scope and cut 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.780
 the black stripes to white and how 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:32.340
 otherwise europe should go on without 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:35.910
 Shut up now you take yours 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.730
 ball and usually once around it as wide 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.799
 Yes, that's our measure 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.629
 with which we take the long strip 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.459
 cut and give a little something 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.019
 because if you do things over each other 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.879
 It is not so bad sticking though 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.579
 you're missing something totally stupid 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.230
 It would always be more like too much than too much 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:59.010
 little so if we have this here 26 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:06.180
 that's why I have to go now 27 5 and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:11.609
 free so 15 cm borrow his batteries 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.840
 are 89 extra deposed the dance and 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.340
 expect musicians are actually yes 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.169
 Something I forget but what yes 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.720
 see, now I know thinking of 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.160
 were guests his battery darmstadt 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.970
 just wants to come once so now 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.740
 Here in the middle a rounding 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.060
 do 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.370
 a source gave me this round 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.370
 Opening things in the middle 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.640
 Of course, readers are smart now 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:50.350
 but to lazy but you 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:54.810
 does that - replaces blender 1 tc 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.810
 fix is ​​paralyzed 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.590
 it should look like this 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.180
 and I actually have those here 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.010
 there is such a round thing inside 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.330
 Again and again, but I think so 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.580
 everyone who sees it understands it that way 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.540
 that is to a fugue so that's cool 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.690
 we do not have to do that extra extra 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.130
 stick because that already sticks so and now 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.200
 you are looking for the front 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:29.000
 the side of the most beautiful 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.230
 let's just live that out 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.610
 better but with me the glue is still 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.920
 a bit wet that's why it sounds 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.190
 not really dry because of that 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.110
 let go in between 150 pokémon 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.880
 meanwhile, how many are starting to catch 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.370
 i am so old when i was little it was 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.190
 another 150 pokémon with 1 51 pokémon and 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.640
 now somehow no idea 1000 5000 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.810
 a fantastic i do not know if 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.370
 I do not even know everyone anymore 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.260
 I can not even remember by heart 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.510
 the 150 memorizes now if 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.880
 we tied our star and you can 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.440
 consider how long do you want the whole 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.120
 we just do one upstairs 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.430
 knot with her that must be on the two 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.230
 know means we need a loop 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.570
 knot normally then we need 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.270
 if possible, a pin without a head if 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.410
 you have and something asterisk 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.610
 sequins or pokémon sequins if 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.810
 you have but I did not 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
 found a shop 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.590
 then you put this star on like that 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.050
 bad that tata was and among the 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.790
 star 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.490
 it has to look like that and somehow 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.790
 you put that up in the middle of 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.990
 your cup already ready for 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.200
 who are still motivated 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.000
 they can do that in here, of course 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.110
 do it properly and if it does not 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.580
 sticks properly again 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.190
 abschmiert the adhesive with flying in the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.080
 it hot glue everything works to 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.610
 You can give that to somebody 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.780
 you love it a lot and throw it 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.370
 just write to him and write that is 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.630
 i believe very romantic and year old 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.680
 Girls like that, otherwise it works 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.240
 continue next week 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.250

 and we also bake biscuits and 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.060
