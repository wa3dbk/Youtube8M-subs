00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
so my hopes are still up what I wonder

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.400 
so my hopes are still up what I wonder
who<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.910> vulnerables<00:03:02.360> would<00:03:02.630> actually<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.260> in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
who the vulnerables would actually be in

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.190 
who the vulnerables would actually be in
the<00:03:03.500> human<00:03:03.769> world<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.120> think<00:03:08.329> of<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.750> they

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
the human world and I think of it they

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500 
the human world and I think of it they
could<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.980> Blue<00:03:10.099> Angels<00:03:10.519> well<00:03:11.090> it's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
could be the the Blue Angels well it's

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.800 
could be the the Blue Angels well it's
obvious<00:03:12.500> though<00:03:13.239> who<00:03:14.239> else<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.660> they<00:03:14.690> be

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
obvious though who else would they be

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.960 
obvious though who else would they be
like<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> racing<00:03:15.829> team<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.220> racing<00:03:16.610> kilohertz

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
like a racing team with racing kilohertz

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.170 
like a racing team with racing kilohertz
that<00:03:17.209> would<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.480> strange<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.849> guess<00:03:19.849> it<00:03:20.060> would

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that would be strange I guess it would

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.960 
that would be strange I guess it would
be<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.390> most<00:03:20.510> logical<00:03:20.720> wouldn't<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.970> don't

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
be the most logical wouldn't it I don't

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.940 
be the most logical wouldn't it I don't
know<00:03:23.090> thank<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.569> for<00:03:23.690> watching<00:03:24.049> I<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.319> once
