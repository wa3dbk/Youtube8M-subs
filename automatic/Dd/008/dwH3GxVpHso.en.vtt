 series of two wins in a row to the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 hamburg freezers you still one 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 not much better are the last four 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 games have won the hamburger and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.939
 her series which is very closely connected with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.789
 a goalkeeper niklas treutle since 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.349
 he instead of Dimitri Kochnev in a box 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.750
 it stands it runs in the freezers 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.020
 the lot still an honor for striker 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 jerome flaake he was elected to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
 Player of the month of October 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 the best hamburger star in front of this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.930
 partie with 14 points 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.090
 purely in the game it is a rougher 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 Start the hamburger gathers in the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.340
 first two and a half minutes in total 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 Three penalties here Brandon Reid because of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.460
 high stick against christoph gawlik the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 outnumber ingolstadt but loyal 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 prepared sulzer against it and also 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.280
 against gawlik gawlik has in the first duel 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 of the two teams the ingolstadt 5 to 2 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.189
 has won a total of four scorer points 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 collected and stan because we are loyal too 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.340
 again against the blow of 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.299
 Jakob feature network then the hamburger im 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.240
 powerplay 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 lose the slice 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.479
 counter opportunity for ingolstadt tyler 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 bouck with the perfect pass also for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.909
 bata one to zero in the seventh minute 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 so sometimes it can be full of city 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.490
 but does not use his overpaid games 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.729
 then you will run into thirds 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 Season hits for her father 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.079
 return from nuremberg already on 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.829
 met Wednesday against wolfsburg 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.040
 treutle here without any 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.040
 defensive possibility 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 the answer of the hamburger three minutes 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 later poked in front of the box smaller 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.270
 gave me the overview on kevin schmidt 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 that makes the 1 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 to 1 second goal of the season for the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.469
 Canadian defender with German 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.019
 pass is better now than in 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.540
 his first del-season and his 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.690
 he already has offensive qualities 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.730
 two seasons under proof 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 had in the second league for the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 Hanover indians in a season 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 11 hits marked one to one means 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.250
 it after the first third but the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.860
 Ingolstadt team convoy takes one more 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.459
 punish in the second passage the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.260
 hamburger so in powerplay we are 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.269
 still dull in the first few seconds 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.780
 pettinger comes on and makes 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.019
 through the legs of their golden the 2 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.500
 2 1 there are just 49 seconds 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.849
 played in the second round fourth 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.700
 season goal for metz bed im job and 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.700
 without really looking at the gate 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.130
 The Ingolstadt now with good too 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.450
 thomas greilinger riotous compensation 22 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.120
 That's just 37 seconds after the hamburger 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.770
 the ingolstadt fans are the one to 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.710
 long way to hamburg on itself 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.570
 have cheered and thomas 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.460
 greilinger is getting better and better 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.650
 already his seventh goal of the season 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.700
 Niklas Treutle from this shot 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.900
 acute angle 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.930
 if caught 25 minute hamburg again 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.710
 in powerplay with matura and matt 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.930
 Pettinger 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.490
 He has the eye for brandon reid and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.450
 then it says 3 to 2 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.130
 the renewed leadership for hamburg brad 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.950
 pitt with his fifth goal of the season 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.320
 and he takes over the leadership in 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.320
 the internal scorer rating if he is at the 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.050
 first hamburger gate already an assists 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.730
 has delivered the new entry from the 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.810
 but Switzerland already had eight years ago 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.400
 ever played for the freezers and 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.150
 The hamburger does not have enough in it yet 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.270
 this second third 34 minute jerome 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.520
 Flaake's tasks are as simple as that 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.460
 sometimes when ice hockey that leads to 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.549
 two sixth goals this season for wolf and 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.190
 jerome flaake moves in with brandon reid 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.980
 the internal hamburger scorer list 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.980
 this one is the same again 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.180
 42 so the score after the first 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.000
 two-thirds of the hamburger go along 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.530
 a two-goal lead in the last 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.290
 section and we jump into the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.210
 Final minutes the Ingolstadt have 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.340
 already taken out her keeper and 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.500
 then the hamburger do it all 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.750
 ripped off thomas dolak with the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.460
 Decision to 5 to 2 in the 58 minute 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:05.060
 third goal of the season for soldier us 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.060
 hamburg currency 40 for the 2 5 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.830
 defeat in ingolstadt in the first 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.100
 clash of two teams in 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.560
 this season and win this second 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.470
 duel with the same result at the conclusion 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.520
 is there again a small one ? 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.650
 opinion exchange between tim convoy 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.110
 and christoph shoves at that, too 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.020
 niklas treutle to the hamburger keeper 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.080
 Simple convoy tries to stay here 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:41.600
 clear point winner but the three counter 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:43.070
 you stay in hamburg i believe that 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.230
 we against well organized team 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.640
 who have played well 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.780
 they would have their second 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.280
 used overpayment situation 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.740
 in the third we were again superior 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.260
 But the shots could not stop in 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.680
 Munich and that's why the victory goes 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.750
 believe - the fifth victory in a row and 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.210
 we play self-confidence and kick 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.650
 as a team invested on us and 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.650
 You can tell that at the time of the result
