00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
 I'm tv 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.140
 stuff from all the guys here we are in 60 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.630
 and it's nothing we make ourselves beautiful 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.870
 play this game very much 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:26.840
 gangsta will help you as an excuse 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:32.720
 and I denied you are playing center 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:37.250
 tracks is what's going to come out on the 4th 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.560
 already because we had nothing to 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.350
 better to do oh well by the center is always 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.880
 a very fat gangsta brand yes yes give 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:53.080
 give us you know I pass the link to the good of 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:57.019
 what is it all about? 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.900
 I think it's the same center between herbs 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.360
 maybe it goes well yes yes after I go to see 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.940
 link yes yes yes yes yes okay okay 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:16.790
 old man is me and gangster states 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.470
 then exit center or maybe if we go to 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.870
 see the video together maybe 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.900
 let's comment together I bet already 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.790
 which will be one of the most gangsta games ever 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.500
 come out and never manufactured so in short one 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.300
 of those games that just barely 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.170
 see cag the bricks 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.920
 yes yes yes yes to here we are again here and now 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.310
 we will look at this elusive sense of the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 I think in my opinion it is one of those 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.560
 games games that you just see 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.650
 it comes from I don't know what but it comes to you 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.280
 just that thing right there 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.480
 meanwhile we see peggy 18 it is forbidden to 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 minors therefore if you are under eighteen 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.470
 buy it anyway 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.470
 ok then let's start life from 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.660
 for the teens the raga boys 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.470
 this must be a dream 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.510
 but we're sure it's the right video 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 robot 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.440
 but not at all 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.569
 do do for generation 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.530
 the thing thing what 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.530
 what is this stuff 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.710
 well there is also flash 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:06.990
 to work lives to cry 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:10.410
 sixth proof how to ruin one's life in 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.230
 three a minute and 7 hate that this stuff 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.790
 it's not the gangster he's not gay at all 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:23.070
 What is even here and watch what 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:28.170
 this stuff is what this guy is here 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:35.330
 what that primative flash is now 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:38.670
 now it comes to what is this thing if not 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.030

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.980

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.690
 sense in famous prototype 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.180
