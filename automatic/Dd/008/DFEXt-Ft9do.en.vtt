00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 Everyone has always been concerned about the problem of dog food. 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.560
 Also want to give dogs the best food for them. 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.240
 Today I will tell you when preparing food for dogs. 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.060
 5 places to pay attention to 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.640
 &gt;&gt;Meg: Come, please, we all love to eat... 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.020
 &gt;&gt;Meg: Dr. Andy Roark 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 Pet owners are the easiest to forget when feeding pets? 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.679
 &gt;&gt;Meg: Match the right wine! 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.620
 &gt;&gt;Stephen: Say thank you to the dog. Seriously, is this difficult? 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.350
 Didn't say right... or let me tell you... 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 Dogs and dogs are not the same, so a dog food will not fit all dogs. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.420
 For example, a long-haired dog is better than a short-haired dog. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.300
 Need more essential fatty acids 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.560
 If the intake is not enough 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.600
 His hair will be short and sly, oh 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680
 Like a tramp living by the river 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.229
 If black dogs don't get enough essential amino acids, they may fade! Don't lie to you~ 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.909
 There is something called phenylalanine 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 It is used to make melanin in the skin. If they can't get enough phenylalanine from food, 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 They can't make enough melanin to keep their black fur. Have you seen some black dogs? 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.450
 For a while, it seems that the color is lighter and browner? That's most likely because they didn't get enough phenylalanine from food. 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.560
 In addition, different dogs have different energy needs. 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.639
 There must be someone around you who wants to eat, eat, and is thin and not fat. 

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:37.179
 And you eat salad and drink cold water every day, the weight is still rising... This is life... 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.030
 This situation can also happen to dogs. So we need to find 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 Dog food for our own dogs 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.420
 In fact, what I want to say is that there is no dog food that is suitable for all dogs. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 Dietary fiber is very helpful for digestion. Many large dogs need higher than small dogs. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.099
 Dietary fiber. If they don’t get enough fiber, 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.950
 They will get chronic colitis, and diarrhea, and it will continue. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.360
 If your large dog often has diarrhea, you have the following options: 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.710
 First, install a drain in the center of the house (convenient to wash the floor) 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.180
 Or, talk to the veterinarian about changing the dog to a dog food with a higher cellulose content. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.740
 You can also add some dietary fiber, such as pumpkin, oatmeal or bran. 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.540
 However, it is generally necessary to see that the amount usually required for improvement is relatively large. 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.630
 It’s a lot easier to get up and down directly from dog food. 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.020
 Some dog food bags say that vomiting or diarrhea is normal in the process of changing to their dog food. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.260
 Don't believe that it is a lie. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910
 Imagine if you go to a restaurant, they hand you a vomit bag while handing you a menu. 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.650
 Will you continue to eat at that restaurant? 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.980
 If your dog vomits or diapers when changing food, or if the dog food is not suitable for dogs, 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.240
 Either change the food is too anxious. Remember to use 3 to 4 days when changing food. 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.680
 Gradually increase new food while reducing old food 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.210
 Some dogs even need a week to complete this transition 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.680
 Pay attention to the dog when changing food, if there is soft stool or vomiting, 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.860
 Just slow down the transition, don't worry 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.620
 We just want the dogs to change their food, but we don't want them to get sick. 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.060
 Commercial dog food can provide dogs with nutritious food. but! The premise is that 90% of your dog's food comes from dog food. 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.510
 This means that if your dog half of the food comes from dog food 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.730
 Half of the food comes from what you have left, and what he eats is likely to make him unbalanced. 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.460
 So, on the already balanced diet of dog food, feed something else. 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.720
 On the contrary, it will make the nutrition of the dog unbalanced. [This is science] 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.030
 The recommended amount of feeding on the dog food bag is based on the average of the dogs. 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.530
 However, your dog may be a lazy, not moving, squatting all day long. 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.130
 Then, he does not need to eat so much every day. 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.060
 Or, if your dog is a four-legged Schwarzenegger, then he must eat more. 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.610
 &gt;&gt;Stephen: Hasta la vista, puppy! (The lines in the movie "Terminator", the original "Hasta la vista, baby!") 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.940
 (Another classic line in Terminator, original: I'll be back) 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.700
 &gt;&gt;Stephen: Come with me, if you want to marry. 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.750
 If you want to know how much you should eat for the dog, call the dog’s weight and follow the recommended amount. 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.510
 Feed for two weeks. After two weeks, I will call the dog again. 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.530
 Adjust the amount of feed by increasing the weight of the dog 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.270
 Remember to always use a cup to record the amount of feed. Remember, the advice on the bag 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.000
 Just a starting point. The end point is a poop bag. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.810
 You will follow the dog and squat. 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.270
 Don't leave a "surprise" to others. 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.100
