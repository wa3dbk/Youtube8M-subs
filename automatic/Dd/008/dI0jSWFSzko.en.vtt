of the code what exactly it is whether

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.530 
of the code what exactly it is whether
it<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.290> be<00:00:45.379> fixed<00:00:45.910> later<00:00:46.910> at<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.300> end<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.480> the

the<00:00:53.809> benefit<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.379> me<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:55.010> is<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.250> lot<00:00:55.670> less

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
the benefit to me is it is a lot less

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.939 
the benefit to me is it is a lot less
downtime<00:00:56.210> it's<00:00:56.839> quicker<00:00:57.049> responsive<00:00:57.769> getting

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
downtime it's quicker responsive getting

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.789 
downtime it's quicker responsive getting
the<00:00:58.010> truck<00:00:58.220> fixed<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.989> trucks<00:01:00.229> you<00:01:00.500> know<00:01:00.559> it's

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
the truck fixed the trucks you know it's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.979 
the truck fixed the trucks you know it's
up<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.070> going<00:01:01.220> quicker<00:01:01.580> it<00:01:02.510> takes<00:01:02.720> a<00:01:02.809> lot<00:01:02.960> of

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
up to going quicker it takes a lot of

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.450 
up to going quicker it takes a lot of
the<00:01:03.140> links<00:01:03.500> out<00:01:03.619> of<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.769> chain<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.280> old

way of like you know you had to call get

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.750 
way of like you know you had to call get
a<00:01:06.200> technician<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.770> come<00:01:06.830> out<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.280> look<00:01:07.460> at<00:01:07.670> it

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
a technician to come out to look at it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.490 
a technician to come out to look at it
and<00:01:07.880> read<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.180> code<00:01:08.390> where<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:08.960> can<00:01:09.140> take<00:01:09.320> all

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
and read the code where I can take all

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.840 
and read the code where I can take all
that<00:01:09.650> out<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.010> equation<00:01:10.040> with<00:01:10.520> virtual

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
technician is pretty much my guy on-site

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.399 
technician is pretty much my guy on-site
24/7<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.909> on<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> truck<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.260> it

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
24/7 because it's on the truck so it

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
24/7 because it's on the truck so it
tells<00:01:18.860> me<00:01:19.100> immediately<00:01:19.610> what's<00:01:19.850> wrong<00:01:20.060> with

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
tells me immediately what's wrong with

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.550 
tells me immediately what's wrong with
it<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.600> where<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:21.049> fix<00:01:21.740> it

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
should handle the code that was just

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.210 
should handle the code that was just
