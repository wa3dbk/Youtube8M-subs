00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
really never been any bike and like this

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.569 
really never been any bike and like this
before<00:01:46.810> well<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.229> today's<00:01:47.439> world<00:01:47.740> having

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
before well in today's world having

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.160 
before well in today's world having
software<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.479> hardware<00:01:49.600> work<00:01:49.990> together

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
software and hardware work together

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.889 
software and hardware work together
seamlessly<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:52.329> make<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.509> real<00:01:52.689> difference

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
seamlessly can make a real difference

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.529 
seamlessly can make a real difference
and<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.939> Ford<00:01:55.689> mode<00:01:56.259> link<00:01:56.890> app<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:58.119> just
