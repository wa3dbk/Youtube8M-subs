00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
hi friends this is Andy from tech store

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.379 
hi friends this is Andy from tech store
and<00:00:13.309> in<00:00:13.580> this<00:00:13.700> video<00:00:13.910> going<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.150> be<00:00:14.210> showing

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
and in this video going to be showing

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.820 
and in this video going to be showing
you<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:14.809> latest<00:00:15.469> asus<00:00:16.160> x<00:00:16.910> 55<00:00:17.540> to<00:00:17.900> see<00:00:18.140> laptop

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
you the latest asus x 55 to see laptop

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.609 
you the latest asus x 55 to see laptop
now<00:00:19.610> we've<00:00:20.480> opened<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.930> things<00:00:21.140> up<00:00:21.349> for<00:00:21.500> you

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
now we've opened the things up for you

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.310 
now we've opened the things up for you
let<00:00:21.980> me<00:00:22.009> start<00:00:22.340> with<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.520> battery<00:00:22.849> first<00:00:23.320> this

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
let me start with the battery first this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.749 
let me start with the battery first this
is<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:24.529> force<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:24.950> lithium<00:00:25.189> ion<00:00:25.250> battery<00:00:25.399> the

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
is a force a lithium ion battery the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.429 
is a force a lithium ion battery the
power<00:00:25.970> readings<00:00:26.270> are<00:00:26.390> 37<00:00:26.689> V<00:00:26.960> tars

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
power readings are 37 V tars

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.159 
power readings are 37 V tars
14-point<00:00:28.189> forwards<00:00:28.790> and<00:00:29.599> it<00:00:29.809> will<00:00:29.899> give<00:00:30.050> you<00:00:30.140> a

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
14-point forwards and it will give you a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.620 
14-point forwards and it will give you a
backup<00:00:30.919> of<00:00:31.040> three<00:00:31.369> years<00:00:31.579> in<00:00:32.119> excess<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.450> three

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
backup of three years in excess of three

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.810 
backup of three years in excess of three
years<00:00:32.840> because<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.680> processor<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.610> X

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
years because the processor that the X

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.319 
years because the processor that the X
55<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.540> C<00:00:35.750> has<00:00:35.960> is<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.350> ultra-low<00:00:36.770> voltage

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
55 to C has is the ultra-low voltage

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.180 
55 to C has is the ultra-low voltage
processor<00:00:38.470> so<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:40.280> adapter<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:42.040> also<00:00:43.040> being

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
processor so the adapter is also being

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.880 
processor so the adapter is also being
changed<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:43.880> sort<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:44.900> a<00:00:45.020> netbook<00:00:45.380> adapter

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
changed it's sort of a netbook adapter

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.580 
changed it's sort of a netbook adapter
if<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.280> take<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.090> way<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.140> power<00:00:48.410> rating

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
if you take it that way the power rating

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.620 
if you take it that way the power rating
is<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.830> 19<00:00:49.130> volts<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:49.700> three<00:00:50.090> point<00:00:50.360> four<00:00:50.540> to

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
is a 19 volts and three point four to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.600 
is a 19 volts and three point four to
five<00:00:50.750> amperes<00:00:50.990> this<00:00:51.740> is<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.070> way<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.310> after

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
five amperes this is the way that after

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.880 
five amperes this is the way that after
looks<00:00:52.790> like<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.500> connect<00:00:54.800> to

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
looks like and this is the connect to

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.100 
looks like and this is the connect to
the<00:00:54.980> L<00:00:55.100> type<00:00:55.310> connector<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.329> comes<00:00:56.600> along<00:00:56.840> with

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
the L type connector it comes along with

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.490 
the L type connector it comes along with
the<00:00:57.260> driver<00:00:57.890> CD<00:00:58.510> which<00:00:59.510> is<00:00:59.540> handy<00:01:00.470> for

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
the driver CD which is handy for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.069 
the driver CD which is handy for
installing<00:01:01.010> windows<00:01:01.370> 8<00:01:01.579> for<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.630> DA<00:01:02.840> space

machine<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:04.840> and<00:01:05.840> coming<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> laptop

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
machine here and coming to the laptop

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.080 
machine here and coming to the laptop
itself<00:01:07.189> this<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.490> way<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:07.700> looks<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
itself this is the way it looks on the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.539 
itself this is the way it looks on the
top<00:01:08.270> panel<00:01:08.450> as<00:01:09.079> you<00:01:09.229> can<00:01:09.380> see<00:01:09.530> jet<00:01:09.860> black<00:01:10.130> in

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
top panel as you can see jet black in

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.510 
top panel as you can see jet black in
color<00:01:10.820> it's<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:11.890> textured<00:01:12.890> finish<00:01:13.190> all

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
color it's got this textured finish all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.500 
color it's got this textured finish all
over<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.050> Lenovo<00:01:15.350> G<00:01:15.530> 500<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:17.270> this

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
over just like the Lenovo G 500 so this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.990 
over just like the Lenovo G 500 so this
mesh<00:01:17.870> textured<00:01:18.680> finish<00:01:21.430> it's<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.670> slim

is the top panel this is the way it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.530 
is the top panel this is the way it
looks

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
looks

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.090

let<00:01:35.540> me<00:01:35.690> show<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.080> tilt<00:01:36.320> angles<00:01:36.770> here

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.840 

these<00:01:42.880> are<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.150> tilt<00:01:43.360> angles<00:01:44.790> maximum<00:01:45.790> that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
these are the tilt angles maximum that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.950 
these are the tilt angles maximum that
will<00:01:46.030> tilt<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.479> around<00:01:46.689> 120<00:01:47.290> degrees<00:01:47.590> rod

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 

now<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.800> way<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.010> looks<00:01:59.220> once<00:01:59.520> opened
