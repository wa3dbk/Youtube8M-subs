00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 traditionally 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:14.389
 who was born in austria in the place that today peter's czech republic called white 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.429
 and lived and worked there throughout his life 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.529
 md is famous for having established the laws of that vitality 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.310
 not that before amended no civ asked themselves as citizen and vitality 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.229
 but the problem is that the ideas were somewhat 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.329
 can be in shape not very defined right 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.580
 It was believed in the membership era for example 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.550
 what was happening was basically the mixture of characteristics of the father of the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 mom 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 in their descendants in varying proportions 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 there are a series of sessions where only one 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.530
 nothing very tangible 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.420
 whereas the amendment does not mandate it is proposed to make a series of 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.730
 experiences 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.680
 It's from crosses using it. 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.380
 by beans and later and medical videos famous for having used the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.320
 peas injured nations 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.620
 through these crossings - then establish what we call 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.369
 today's first and second mendelssohn laws 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.509
 and what government 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.509
 much of genetics as we know it today 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.140
 basically when it is said that an inheritance 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 of a feature has year mania 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.980
 what is meant here is that this characteristic is governed by a 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.490
 genius that presents only two qualities in the general population two 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.880
 alleles as they say 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 then these simpler transmission characteristics that show 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 only 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 two manifestations for example high or low 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 held a joust thinking about the seed of yellow-green living 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.150
 and this is also valid for many characteristics of other living things 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.940
 including man 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.990
 then again characteristically governed by two alleles being one of them 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.020
 dominant and the other recessive 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 not when this is established when such an inheritance 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.500
 we say she obeys the first law I gave 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.930
 giving regular proportions already predictable in subsequent generations 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.079
 and it is as it says standard works modern netto 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.950
 certainly mend the genetic advance in other directions thanks to the 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.439
 Mormon Works 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.519
 that our ideas established the idea that genes are the chromosomes and 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.319
 later on with the discovery of DNA as the genetic material of the vast majority of 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.189
 all living things
