 again this season a bit 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.830
 to have a positive conclusion in the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.500
 first half not completely added 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.850
 had many holes in midfield were 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.900
 to have a half-time in the cabin 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.530
 we said we want somehow the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.790
 keep three points at home and with 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.490
 the positive experiences in the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.200
 Go summer break and then we have 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.520
 because they are not up to it all now 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.980
 have thrown forward shortly before the end 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.650
 get a counter and then it is 0 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.090
 1 football in any case now it works 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.560

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.630

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.370
 Seasonal preparation as it looks now 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.370
 short break from i think the whole 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.790
 Team will think twice now 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.350
 weeks keep your feet steady and then 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.540
 we'll get a plan for the moment 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.400
 summer break everyone should follow 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.090

 a new coach is coming, and yes, me 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.750
 do not see this whole season so not 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.290
 as negative as maybe some others 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.330
 We have many points where you get 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.720
 with the other leagues other top league 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.410
 is master and a team was 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.150
 better and we just have to be positive 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.960
 stay in and take the whole swing with you 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.490

 today zero to one that was one 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.529
 You would do the typical 0 0 game as well 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.459
 so sign 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.869

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.149
 make them outnumber this one 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:35.959
 Kontertore pingpong played with the

 goalkeeper and with the defense annoying 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.119
