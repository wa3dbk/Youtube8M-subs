just a really great highlighter

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
just a really great highlighter
especially<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.180> fine<00:00:48.420> lines<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
especially if you do have fine lines and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
especially if you do have fine lines and
wrinkles<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:50.120> glides<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.360> over

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
those and I mean I feel like it even

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.060 
those and I mean I feel like it even
makes<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.030> less<00:00:54.510> noticeable<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
makes them look less noticeable so this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
makes them look less noticeable so this
really<00:00:56.280> brightens<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.850> face<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.390> makes
