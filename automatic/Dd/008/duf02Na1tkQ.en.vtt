make sure you have spiral path button

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.439 
make sure you have spiral path button
clicked<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> wanna<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> smoothing

and you just start off drawing that I
might<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.789> much<00:00:44.820> smoothing

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
might have a little too much smoothing

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
might have a little too much smoothing
let's<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.079> down<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> 39<00:00:47.329> okay<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:50.059> just

let's go down to 39 okay like this just
keep<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.770> doctor<00:00:54.260> it's<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.440> okay<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.010> that's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
keep on doctor it's not okay so that's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
keep on doctor it's not okay so that's
enough<00:00:56.570> and<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:01.949> this

there so you get your busier curve tool
you<00:01:19.670> make<00:01:19.939> sure<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> spiral<00:01:20.869> path<00:01:21.110> is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
you make sure the spiral path is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.679 
you make sure the spiral path is
selected<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.920> put<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.820> make<00:01:23.420> sure<00:01:23.570> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
thing that we want to do is we want to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.779 
thing that we want to do is we want to
change<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.289> into<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.679> path<00:02:09.950> object<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.610> path

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
change this into a path object to path

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.970 
change this into a path object to path
so<00:02:11.599> now<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.140> manipulate<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:14.980> more

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so now we can manipulate this more

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.930 
so now we can manipulate this more
easily<00:02:16.310> or<00:02:16.690> make<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.810> into<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.519> little<00:02:19.519> pointy

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
easily or make this into a little pointy

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.319 
easily or make this into a little pointy
end<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:21.709> will<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.160> end<00:02:22.609> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> leaf<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
end this will be the end of the leaf and

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.559 
end this will be the end of the leaf and
this<00:02:23.480> will<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.049> base<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.299> play

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
this will be the base and then you play

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.539 
this will be the base and then you play
around<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.019> what<00:02:27.829> kind<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.010> shape<00:02:28.280> you'd

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
around with what kind of shape you'd

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.780 
around with what kind of shape you'd
like<00:02:29.560> maybe<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.739> want<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.950> little<00:02:31.220> curve<00:02:31.519> like

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
like maybe you want a little curve like

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.210 
like maybe you want a little curve like
this<00:02:33.609> it's<00:02:34.609> really<00:02:34.910> what<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.239> want<00:02:36.220> whatever

you want it to look like you have this a
little<00:02:41.569> more<00:02:41.750> pointy<00:02:41.959> or<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.410> could<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.650> it

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
little more pointy or you could have it

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.809 
little more pointy or you could have it
more<00:02:43.040> flat<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:44.540> really<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.170> just

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
more flat it's really up to you just

more flat it's really up to you just
play<00:02:46.819> around<00:02:46.970> with<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:50.989> don't<00:02:51.139> we

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
play around with it do they don't we

play around with it do they don't we
want<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:54.579> we<00:02:55.579> can<00:02:55.730> either<00:02:55.819> just<00:02:56.120> duplicate

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
want to we can either just duplicate

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.150 
want to we can either just duplicate
these<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.299> or<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.230> could<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.799> select

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
these like that or you could just select

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.530 
these like that or you could just select
one<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.239> get<00:03:02.540> your<00:03:02.750> spray<00:03:03.200> key<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.739> then

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
one and then get your spray key and then

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.600 
one and then get your spray key and then
make<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> bunch<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> them<00:03:07.420> or<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:11.060> could

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
make a bunch of them or you could

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.580 
make a bunch of them or you could
copy<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.370> go<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.670> go<00:03:16.030> over<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.330> your<00:03:16.590> free

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
copy this and go up go over to your free

copy this and go up go over to your free
hand<00:03:17.830> tool<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.270> go<00:03:19.270> up<00:03:19.390> here<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.600> shape<00:03:19.960> and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
hand tool and go up here to shape and

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.830 
hand tool and go up here to shape and
hit<00:03:20.320> from<00:03:20.710> clipboard<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.520> then<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.570> can<00:03:22.690> just

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
hit from clipboard and then you can just

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.760 
hit from clipboard and then you can just
make<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.050> bunch<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:24.690> other<00:03:25.690> leaves<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.900> if<00:03:32.110> you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
make a bunch of other leaves and if you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.050 
make a bunch of other leaves and if you
know<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.920> might<00:03:33.160> want<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> smooth<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.820> up<00:03:33.940> a

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
know you might want to smooth it up a

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.580 
know you might want to smooth it up a
little<00:03:34.150> more<00:03:34.450> it's<00:03:34.720> really<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.380> what

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
little more it's really up to you what

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.990 
little more it's really up to you what
you<00:03:35.710> want<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> do<00:03:38.280> anyway<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.370> got<00:03:39.670> some<00:03:39.700> decent

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
you want to do anyway I got some decent

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
you want to do anyway I got some decent
leaves<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.540> fine

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
leaves that's fine

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.630 
leaves that's fine
I'll<00:03:41.560> probably<00:03:41.740> get<00:03:41.950> rid<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.250> few<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.490> these

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
I'll probably get rid of a few of these

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.620 
I'll probably get rid of a few of these
but<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:44.470> kind<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:44.710> crooked<00:03:45.240> but<00:03:46.240> sometimes

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
but is it kind of crooked but sometimes

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.930 
but is it kind of crooked but sometimes
you<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:47.220> things<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.460> nature<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.880> are

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
you have things in nature that are

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.320 
you have things in nature that are
slightly<00:03:49.570> crooked<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.110> I'll<00:03:50.830> leave<00:03:51.100> one<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.180> we

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
slightly crooked so I'll leave one so we

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.870 
slightly crooked so I'll leave one so we
have<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:53.200> leaves<00:03:53.590> here<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.520> we<00:03:54.700> can

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
have these leaves here and then we can

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.900 
have these leaves here and then we can
make<00:03:55.180> these<00:03:55.390> into<00:03:56.400> well<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.459> don't<00:03:57.610> have<00:03:57.760> to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
make these into well you don't have to

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.840 
make these into well you don't have to
but<00:03:58.740> sometimes<00:03:59.740> it's<00:03:59.920> better<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.160> manipulate

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
but sometimes it's better to manipulate

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.330 
but sometimes it's better to manipulate
him<00:04:00.970> with<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.330> turn<00:04:02.200> into<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.530> path<00:04:02.770> also<00:04:03.070> if

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
him with you turn into a path also if

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.770 
him with you turn into a path also if
you<00:04:03.490> want<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.730> move<00:04:03.880> them<00:04:04.030> around<00:04:04.150> sometimes

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
you want to move them around sometimes

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.440 
you want to move them around sometimes
they'll<00:04:05.020> change<00:04:05.830> shapes<00:04:06.130> on<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:07.300> now

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
they'll change shapes on you but now

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.100 
they'll change shapes on you but now
since<00:04:07.930> I've<00:04:08.080> got<00:04:08.290> them<00:04:08.410> as<00:04:09.450> paths<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.900> just

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
since I've got them as paths I can just

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.310 
since I've got them as paths I can just
I<00:04:11.350> can<00:04:11.560> change<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.610> scale<00:04:13.000> easily<00:04:13.540> without

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
I can change the scale easily without

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.759 
I can change the scale easily without
them<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:16.600> know<00:04:16.720> being<00:04:17.590> finicky<00:04:19.620> before<00:04:20.620> when

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
them you know being finicky before when

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.110 
them you know being finicky before when
they're<00:04:20.890> object<00:04:21.310> they<00:04:21.459> probably<00:04:21.669> they<00:04:21.970> would

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
they're object they probably they would

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880 
they're object they probably they would
have<00:04:22.240> been<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.780> little<00:04:23.080> finicky<00:04:23.440> with<00:04:23.680> me<00:04:23.860> I

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
have been a little finicky with me I

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.680 
have been a little finicky with me I
want<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.190> change<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:24.910> around<00:04:25.120> or<00:04:25.270> right<00:04:25.540> to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
want to change it around or right to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.909 
want to change it around or right to
rotating<00:04:26.110> them<00:04:26.880> sometimes<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.650> do<00:04:29.770> these

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
rotating them sometimes you can do these

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.810 
rotating them sometimes you can do these
leaves<00:04:30.370> around<00:04:32.280> how<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.940> them<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:36.669> can

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
leaves around how you like them you can

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.250 
leaves around how you like them you can
change<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:38.050> know<00:04:38.140> everything<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:40.260> a

change you know everything to a
particular<00:04:41.950> green<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.550> then<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:42.730> go

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
particular green and then you go

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.120 
particular green and then you go
individually<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.840> each<00:04:44.380> one<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.650> these<00:04:44.770> and

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
change it to a lighter green like this

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.630 
change it to a lighter green like this
you<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.940> hit<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.270> fill<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.430> then<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.550> go

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
you go and hit this fill and then you go
