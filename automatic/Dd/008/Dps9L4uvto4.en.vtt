 I give you the music murder for the 1.4 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.100
 point 7 and yes we see already seen 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.629
 I just got a nice sound 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:51.079
 made yes show it here again 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:55.189
 here are probably some of 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.949

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.479

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.100
 there is again a 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.199
 There are two things once percussion 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 and once here his piano what 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.920
 somehow for liliputans or something 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.790
 No idea we could do it 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.790
 also play something 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.780
 no idea that it's pretty 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.940
 is loud because I hardly hear anything in the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 you piano and more because I am piano 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 the sound recently have been 100% 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.580
 and I can give it to you now 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.920
 Submit before you hear me 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.080
 so and yes as her love comes and so 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.940
 I'll show you now, her 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.410
 Needs for whom you need for this 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.850
 you need wood for the piano 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.190
 you then need a cast iron play 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.930
 and the round pedals and yes like that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.810
 you got all the chaos you got 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.790
 this caste and you have to be very strong 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.430
 and strings and the strings you get 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.720
 So stop to 3 1 there are no 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.560
 normal drinks but which ones out 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.570
 metal and has and all castings too 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.270
 you just have to get an all-in and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.670
 had a piece of coal had what was 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.640
 then what had to be tasted was 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.290
 that's exactly the pedals 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.330
 you just do the pedals with three 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.000
 gold and also gets three pieces 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220
 suitable for the piano and what you for 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.670
 Once you have drums you have to be here 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.570
 the samples are called the halt 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 this bracket for the collection or the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.400
 are called here jumps and here too 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.250
 everything full of james and how you the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.020
 I'll tell you snares next door 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.230
 the share nuggets and hurt you so here 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.200
 do not wanna say cross now 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.420
 then you get one 82 times and then 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.570
 Also this bracket the two tier with 2 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.220
 and one above the other and then you build 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.540
 of course also the james 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.130
 the drums makes the lives here and 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.010
 lapis lazuli actually that is in itself 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.920
 pretty logical recipe except 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 Did that mean we should really do that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.470
 apparently only represent the color and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.450
 are to be able to play the drums 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.150
 not long here we need first 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.530
 the drums then that goes first and yes 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 We need the trams to get it 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.170
 stop taking two steaks each other and 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.410
 we got 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.850
 drum sticks and yes that is actually 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.900
 it and its note comes here 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.040
 do not participate 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:35.400
 just a note and yes what else is there 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.500
 so what else is there 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.670
 I can not do it so fast and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.470
 I need creative mode and yes it 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.609
 just stop in the creative nokia above 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.060
 second that only with it only at that 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.540
 is only for construction work so on everyone 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.489
 If you need a salary you should have it like that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.549
 forces or with too many things or 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.099
 not and on items ebit at ford stuff 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.190
 I would still take on 1 because that is 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.739
 now here I am sorry most 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.659
 Do you want us that with the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.049
 afternoon motto or make but go 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.319
 not always 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.579
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, not better 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.900
 In any case, we start like me 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.220
 Show yourself now that's the way it is 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.459
 You can either click the button here 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.070
 must press you or do that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.150
 on the keyboard even the keyboard 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.880
 turned on and then you can 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.870
 to play her 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.780
 you probably hear that better than 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.139
 me because i'm not that good here 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.729
 I play very nicely so 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.260
 Kathi online or head of skate 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.880
 make and play here to play here 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.139

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.139

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.909
 and yes or recently with keyboard 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.909
 and then you can 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.590
 yes I can just not as good as and as 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.410

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.340
 of course a lot of 1.4 point 7 and easy 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.690
 In the description of that Dorfe thy 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.780

 original post and then you can 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.830
 openly , however , had a look 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.720
 Listed cluttered and yes then

 percent confirmed that on the ok and yes 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.160
 goes in the point minecraft folder in 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.320
 the folder makes a right click 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.820
 the minecraft opens with winrar dear 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.510
 that does not close in the middle 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.790
 minimize 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.470
 First, put the meter in folder 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.760
 so now he is deleted 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.000
 otherwise that changes the motto 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.850

 minecraft ford makes ctrl and a or 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.180
 Just pull everything is the same too 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.220
 you can calmly point the point 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.020
 make folder that is correct then 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.440
 folder just pulls it back there 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.350
 and confirm it so then you can 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.710
 the minecraft forge left the mark 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:51.130
 ford too and yes you go here then 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.900

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.910
 minecraft start even need her 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.140
 actually not at all 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.030

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.040
 yes, one hundred percent maybe 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.770
 probably synonymous mods folder must 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.600
 but not just can replace files 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.100
