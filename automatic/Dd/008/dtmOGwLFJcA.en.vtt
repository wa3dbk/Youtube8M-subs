00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
the podiatrist tried the cortisone

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.049 
the podiatrist tried the cortisone
injections<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.650> it<00:00:43.799> really<00:00:44.040> didn't<00:00:44.400> work<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
injections and it really didn't work and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.539 
injections and it really didn't work and
so<00:00:45.170> we<00:00:46.170> decided<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.650> go<00:00:46.769> in<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.100> clean<00:00:47.400> out<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:47.549 
so we decided to go in and clean out the

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.350 
so we decided to go in and clean out the
joint<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:48.299> remove<00:00:48.540> all<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.870> Spurs<00:00:49.199> and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
joint and remove all the Spurs and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.869 
joint and remove all the Spurs and
obviously<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.479> gave<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.080> option<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
obviously I gave you the option of

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.460 
obviously I gave you the option of
fusion<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.269> I<00:00:54.449> gave<00:00:54.659> you<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:54.809> option<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.290> a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
fusion and I gave you an option of a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.549 
fusion and I gave you an option of a
total<00:00:55.979> implant<00:00:56.339> but<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.059> decided

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
total implant but we kind of decided

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
total implant but we kind of decided
well<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.589> think<00:00:58.860> not<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.790> yet

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
well I think not not yet

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.500 
well I think not not yet
right<00:01:00.780> our<00:01:01.199> older<00:01:01.680> maybe<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.489> did<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:03.210> my

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
right our older maybe I did right my

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
right our older maybe I did right my
point<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> doing<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.890> full

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
point of doing this was to get my full

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.429 
point of doing this was to get my full
range

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
range

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.120 
range

great<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.380> know<00:02:05.500> happy<00:02:06.070> without<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.460> food

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
great you know happy without the food

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.700 
great you know happy without the food
every<00:02:07.300> every<00:02:07.660> week<00:02:07.810> it's<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.110> real<00:02:08.290> difference

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
every every week it's a real difference

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.710 
every every week it's a real difference
yeah<00:02:09.190> right<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.970> remember<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.360> told<00:02:10.450> you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
yeah right and I remember I told you

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540 
yeah right and I remember I told you
that<00:02:10.810> medicine<00:02:11.500> improves<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> time

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
that medicine improves all the time

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.480 
that medicine improves all the time
which<00:02:13.330> basically<00:02:13.750> means<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.380> probably<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.430> a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
which basically means that probably in a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.570 
which basically means that probably in a
couple<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.850> years<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:17.160> something<00:02:18.160> needs<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.490> be

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
couple of years if something needs to be

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.850 
couple of years if something needs to be
done<00:02:18.850> again<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.930> probably<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.680> some

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
done again they probably will have some

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.590 
done again they probably will have some
kind<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.100> artificial<00:02:21.580> cartilage<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.450> can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
kind of artificial cartilage that we can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.560 
kind of artificial cartilage that we can
implant<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.290> something<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.980> newer<00:02:24.820> texture

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
implant or something of newer texture

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.160 
implant or something of newer texture
because<00:02:25.840> unfortunately<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:27.870> implants<00:02:28.870> big

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
because unfortunately with implants big

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.890 
because unfortunately with implants big
toe<00:02:29.320> implants<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:30.550> really<00:02:30.880> don't<00:02:31.030> see<00:02:31.270> more

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
toe implants we really don't see more

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.410 
toe implants we really don't see more
than<00:02:32.140> maybe<00:02:32.530> ten<00:02:32.860> years<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.300> have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
than maybe ten years and then you have

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.870 
than maybe ten years and then you have
to<00:02:34.540> replace<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.130> somebody<00:02:36.460> who's<00:02:36.700> very

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
to replace so in somebody who's very

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.380 
to replace so in somebody who's very
sedentary<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.770> are<00:02:38.890> not<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.240> I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
sedentary and you are not you know I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.340 
sedentary and you are not you know I
would<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.810> would<00:02:41.140> put<00:02:41.170> an<00:02:41.380> implant<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.980> but

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
would I would put an implant and but

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.500 
would I would put an implant and but
with<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.709> would<00:02:44.890> probably<00:02:45.130> wear<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
with you it would probably wear out in a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.980 
with you it would probably wear out in a
matter<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.840> two<00:02:47.709> years<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.540> fact<00:02:49.660> actually

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
matter of two years and in fact actually

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.250 
matter of two years and in fact actually
I<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.380> did<00:02:51.160> surgery<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.150> somebody<00:02:52.690> who<00:02:52.959> was

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
I just did surgery on somebody who was

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290 
I just did surgery on somebody who was
in<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.560> type<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.800> situation<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:55.000> was<00:02:55.120> very

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
in this type of situation it was very

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.550 
in this type of situation it was very
unfortunate<00:02:55.660> because<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.080> didn't<00:02:56.290> put<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
unfortunate because I didn't put the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.440 
unfortunate because I didn't put the
implant<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.459> never<00:02:57.700> would<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.270> young

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
implant and I never would on a young

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.930 
implant and I never would on a young
person<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.260> we<00:02:59.830> ended<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.130> having<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.490> fuse

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
person and we ended up having to fuse

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.990 
person and we ended up having to fuse
the<00:03:01.209> joint<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
the joint just because of not the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.880 
the joint just because of not the
correct<00:03:04.300> procedure<00:03:04.360> being<00:03:05.200> chosen<00:03:05.470> for<00:03:05.860> that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
correct procedure being chosen for that
