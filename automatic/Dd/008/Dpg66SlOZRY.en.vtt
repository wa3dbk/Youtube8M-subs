00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.910
 hi everyone decidedly at each 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.380
 once I start a video on am 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.860
 straightening up like an old man 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.019
 grandfather 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.099
 it's a crazy thing I just came 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:17.599
 to see that I do this every time 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:22.609
 a video for just for a small 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:29.539
 little mess with you I wanted you 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:32.570
 show a vapor on 100% glycerine 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.420
 plant 100% wicket a plant museum 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.830
 I'm not asking you she's here and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.260
 when I say I'm not lying to you it's that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.190
 I have the liter we see glycerin 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.910
 vegetable glycerol purchased in pharmacy 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.340
 so this is the brand cooper so a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.380
 very very good quality she is good 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.900
 obviously in 0 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.330
 nicotine since pharmacies do not 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.170
 do not sell glycerine with 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.940
 nicotine in and last night in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 tinkering like that I was looking for 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.150
 little fun things to do and I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 said to me you 're going to be tested on the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.750
 100% vg I had never done yet I 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 absolutely wanted to test this famous 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.240
 100% vg so I took my rdr modified 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.440
 that you have already seen in another 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.780
 video with the hole here aeration which 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:36.090
 is 4 mm I put them on my mode 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 400g twisted 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.810
 a cantal commands 0.20 games the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.909
 games the twists and so to get 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.119
 a thick groom of cantal 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.110
 I did my editing on a wick in 3 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 mm in silica and I get g - so I 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.869
 measured in an electronic mode and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 I get a resistance of 0 5 mhz 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.840
 to tell you a really a very 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.149
 low resistance 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.519
 I made my little mixture with the rom 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 chlorophyll thanks julien to the passage there 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.019
 we chlorophyll from really top top top 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.329
 if you really like everything that is 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.299
 hollywood chewing gums of the time and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.489
 all that frankly test this aroma 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.549
 it's really great and I bring it in and 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.209
 pure glycerine for blood is not 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.760
 neither water 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.099
 to add there is not a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.799
 drop of alcohol to add it's 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.950
 really 100% vegetable glycerin 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.269
 vegetable is just the rom is it 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 give it to me that's it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 Yes 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.860
 it's just a loan nickname volume 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.900
 besides you see pushed a little 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.180
 little 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.730
 I tested last night I shot five bars 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.810
 on top of my desk was in the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.180
 total fog 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.590
 it's amazing I continue I you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.490
 shows again because it's really 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.490
 It's really worth it 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.900
 it's crazy it's crazy 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.549

 so here I wanted to show you 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.790
 how did that give you 100% vg and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.200
 well frankly if you really want to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.390
 you break out in parties between 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.930
 friends between 20 potter test the 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.349
 frankly it's super great to test the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.970
 preferably on a modified atomizer 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:14.480
 for the extreme ping leaven where the extreme 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.419
 bape with a very very low resistance 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.120
 preferably and have fun break out 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.010
 you it was just to tell you that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.150
