00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070
 the picture quality in the test 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.699
 as the first system camera of the x-series 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 owns the fujifilm x1 can extras 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.570
 team sensor by its special 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.369
 color filter arrangement among others 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.009
 can do without a low pass filter 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.759
 otherwise the sensor of the x1 falls very much 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.860
 similar with its 23 6 15 6 mm 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.080
 he owns the same size and the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.629
 same crop factor as identical 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.820
 is the resolution 16 megapixel solved c 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.769
 mos sensor of the camera on at the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.160
 Recording of jpeg images is an iso 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.260
 range of 125 1600 available at 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.180
 this is something in raw format 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.229
 limited here only 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.600
 iso 200 to iso 6,400 set in 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.339
 direct comparison to ex transport chips 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.860
 the image sensor cuts the xa 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.119
 very good off to 800 iso there is no 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.280
 visible differences 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.520
 The picture quality is very high 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.619
 Image noise virtually non-existent 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.970
 only from iso 1600 can then be 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.470
 first but only marginally 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.049
 recognize difference 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.020
 the shots of the x1 are a bit soft 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.960
 drawn as in xl1 or xe 1 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.740
 off iso 3200, this trend is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.080
 on 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.030
 at iso 12.800 the difference is 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.620
 between the extras timos sensors and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 then the c mos sensor a little clearer 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.080
 visible 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.460
 the distance is still smaller 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.460
 when we expected him 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.580
 less light shows 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.730
 similar picture is the picture noise 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.020
 generally low only from iso 3,200 need 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.850
 larger reductions in image quality 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.950
 to be accepted 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 thus it can be stated that too 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 the picture quality of the x1 can convince 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.510
 although this does not have an extra c mos sensor 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.510
 has 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.020
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.330
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 the camera punkt.de in this b 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.360
 you have the quality comparison 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.830
 possibility the shown 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.640
 cropping interactive too 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.590
 to compare 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.750
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.399
 specify if available objectively 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 choose and the pictures in different 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.210
 compare situations 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.550
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.890
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.290
 or if available as well as the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.210
 iso-sensitivity in addition to different 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.950
 You can also use camera models 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.150
 particular model with different ones 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 compare settings 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.720
 In this example we show the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.720
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 6400 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.409
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.409
 Recordings by day and night
