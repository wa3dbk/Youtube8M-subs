hi I'm John I'm just coming at you guys
with<00:00:08.560> holiday<00:00:09.220> this<00:00:09.370> project<00:00:10.920> presently

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
with holiday this project presently

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.360 
with holiday this project presently
right<00:00:12.520> now<00:00:12.760> I'm<00:00:13.030> working<00:00:13.300> on<00:00:13.719> a<00:00:14.080> closure<00:00:14.920> piece

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
right now I'm working on a closure piece

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.270 
right now I'm working on a closure piece
for<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.850> top<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:17.170> in<00:00:17.320> my<00:00:17.470> opinion<00:00:17.950> it's

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
for the top because in my opinion it's

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.910 
for the top because in my opinion it's
getting<00:00:18.670> really<00:00:19.600> hot<00:00:19.930> and<00:00:20.230> I<00:00:20.470> really<00:00:20.740> don't

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
getting really hot and I really don't

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.710 
getting really hot and I really don't
want<00:00:21.100> to<00:00:21.190> worry<00:00:21.400> about<00:00:23.340> glue<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.970> it's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
want to worry about glue and it's

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.820 
want to worry about glue and it's
sliding<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.770> coming<00:00:27.190> up<00:00:27.460> and<00:00:28.350> reapplying<00:00:29.350> so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
sliding and coming up and reapplying so

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.549 
sliding and coming up and reapplying so
I'm<00:00:29.890> just<00:00:30.190> going<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.430> make<00:00:30.610> a<00:00:31.540> closure<00:00:32.110> for<00:00:32.320> the

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
I'm just going to make a closure for the

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.700 
I'm just going to make a closure for the
top<00:00:32.910> okay<00:00:33.910> this<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.690> what<00:00:34.930> I'm<00:00:35.050> doing<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.440> on

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
top okay this is what I'm doing this on

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.919 
top okay this is what I'm doing this on
is<00:00:35.980> German<00:00:36.520> late<00:00:36.730> so<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.210> holes<00:00:37.450> are<00:00:37.719> a<00:00:37.749> bit

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
is German late so the holes are a bit

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.810 
is German late so the holes are a bit
bigger<00:00:38.199> on<00:00:38.499> on<00:00:39.219> this<00:00:40.199> basically<00:00:41.199> what<00:00:41.559> I<00:00:41.589> did

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
bigger on on this basically what I did

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.470 
bigger on on this basically what I did
before<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:43.289> started<00:00:44.289> ventilating<00:00:44.980> here<00:00:45.339> on<00:00:46.089> to

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
before I started ventilating here on to

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.779 
before I started ventilating here on to
this<00:00:46.719> piece<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.710> went<00:00:48.249> around<00:00:48.609> the

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
this piece is I went around the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.380 
this piece is I went around the
perimeter<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.870> tack<00:00:50.199> it<00:00:50.440> down<00:00:50.469> with

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
perimeter and I tack it down with

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.889 
perimeter and I tack it down with
transparent<00:00:52.390> thread<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.589> that's<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:54.969> when<00:00:55.629> I

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
transparent thread and that's so when I

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.630 
transparent thread and that's so when I
sew<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:56.530> on<00:00:56.829> -<00:00:57.519> on<00:00:57.819> my<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.870> top<00:00:59.109> of<00:00:59.289> my<00:00:59.440> head<00:00:59.710> I

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
sew this on - on my the top of my head I

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.770 
sew this on - on my the top of my head I
have<00:01:01.420> something<00:01:01.929> for<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:02.440> adhere<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
have something for it to adhere to and I

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.630 
have something for it to adhere to and I
didn't<00:01:05.170> really<00:01:05.379> get<00:01:05.560> all<00:01:05.740> crazy<00:01:06.070> but<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.610> is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
didn't really get all crazy but it is

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.840 
didn't really get all crazy but it is
just<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.030> little<00:01:07.270> basic<00:01:07.590> stitch<00:01:08.850> because

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
just a little basic stitch because

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.200 
just a little basic stitch because
basically<00:01:10.090> when<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.630> ventilate<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:13.090> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
basically when you ventilate around the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.569 
basically when you ventilate around the
perimeter<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:13.899> hair<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.409> actually<00:01:14.950> what's

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
perimeter the hair is actually what's

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.539 
perimeter the hair is actually what's
gonna<00:01:15.820> hold<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:19.829> legs<00:01:20.829> in<00:01:21.159> place<00:01:21.219> any

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
gonna hold the legs in place any

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.279 
gonna hold the legs in place any
so<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.810> needle<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.289> I'm<00:01:24.439> using<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:26.289> 3/4

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
so on the needle that I'm using is a 3/4

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.389 
so on the needle that I'm using is a 3/4
and<00:01:27.679> I'm<00:01:28.310> gonna<00:01:28.520> use<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.329> needle<00:01:29.770> around<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
and I'm gonna use this needle around the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.270 
and I'm gonna use this needle around the
perimeter<00:01:32.060> because<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:33.229> hair<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.860> what<00:01:34.070> will

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
perimeter because this hair is what will

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.399 
perimeter because this hair is what will
go<00:01:34.429> over<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.939> track<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.420> want<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.960> be<00:01:36.110> a

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
go over the track so I want it to be a

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.550 
go over the track so I want it to be a
little<00:01:36.799> thicker<00:01:37.130> around<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.179> perimeter<00:01:38.810> area

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
little thicker around the perimeter area

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.309 
little thicker around the perimeter area
and<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.159> think<00:01:40.520> I'll<00:01:40.759> do<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.210> from<00:01:41.479> around<00:01:41.959> here

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
and I think I'll do it from around here

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.550 
and I think I'll do it from around here
down<00:01:42.890> down<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.969> then<00:01:44.780> when<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.079> in<00:01:45.380> this

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
down down and then when I get in this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.660 
down down and then when I get in this
area<00:01:46.069> I'll<00:01:46.549> switch<00:01:46.969> my<00:01:47.000> needle<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.840> maybe<00:01:48.049> a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
area I'll switch my needle to maybe a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.760 
area I'll switch my needle to maybe a
1/2<00:01:49.670> or<00:01:50.000> maybe<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.420> 2/3<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:50.959> don't<00:01:51.170> know<00:01:51.319> yet<00:01:51.560> I

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
1/2 or maybe a 2/3 I don't know yet I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.370 
1/2 or maybe a 2/3 I don't know yet I
see<00:01:52.100> because<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.479> stated<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.990> some<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.259> my

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
see because as I stated in some of my

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.660 
see because as I stated in some of my
other<00:01:54.409> videos<00:01:54.759> I'm<00:01:55.759> new<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.689> well<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
other videos I'm new to this as well so

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.399 
other videos I'm new to this as well so
everything<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:59.030> I'm<00:01:59.239> doing<00:01:59.270> now<00:01:59.599> is<00:02:00.020> really

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
everything that I'm doing now is really

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.649 
everything that I'm doing now is really
for<00:02:00.590> practice<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.909> frontage<00:02:02.390> that

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
for practice this is the frontage that

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.380 
for practice this is the frontage that
I've<00:02:02.780> completed<00:02:03.229> I'm<00:02:04.189> wearing<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.759> now<00:02:05.030> I'm

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
I've completed I'm wearing this now I'm

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.930 
I've completed I'm wearing this now I'm
loving<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.310> but<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.579> very<00:02:07.849> hot<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.819> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
loving it but it's very hot so I have to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.690 
loving it but it's very hot so I have to
actually<00:02:11.209> take<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:11.780> or<00:02:12.019> re-watch<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.950> clean

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
actually take this or re-watch it clean

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.259 
actually take this or re-watch it clean
my<00:02:14.030> perimeter<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.170> reapply<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.799> again

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
my perimeter and then reapply it again

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.809 
my perimeter and then reapply it again
so<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.739> only<00:02:18.920> issue<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.549> have

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
so that is the only issue that I have

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.000 
so that is the only issue that I have
the<00:02:20.150> front<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.959> think<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.739> front

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the front to I think that the front

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.710 
the front to I think that the front
illusion<00:02:22.489> things<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.360> they're

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
illusion things like that it's they're

updated<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.630> my<00:02:45.810> progress<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.700> I've

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
updated on my progress this is what I've

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.990 
updated on my progress this is what I've
done<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.450> far<00:02:49.700> okay

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
done so far okay

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.850 
done so far okay
and<00:02:51.240> basically<00:02:51.720> I'll<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.710> blue

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and basically I'll just put the blue

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
and basically I'll just put the blue
tape<00:02:53.130> under<00:02:53.460> here<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.540> could<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
tape under here so it could be a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.930 
tape under here so it could be a
contrasting<00:02:55.500> color<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.340> tacked<00:02:56.790> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
contrasting color and I just tacked it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.070 
contrasting color and I just tacked it
onto<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.330> front<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:58.400> what<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.670> my<00:03:00.540> template
