00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
can try and get him off the point so I

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
can try and get him off the point so I
can<00:03:32.970> uncap<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.660> at<00:03:33.810> least<00:03:34.100> when<00:03:35.100> you're

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
can uncap it at least when you're

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.340 
can uncap it at least when you're
fighting<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.609> point<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.540> main<00:03:36.750> objective<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350

fighting on point your main objective is
to<00:03:37.470> uncap<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.609> difficult<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:39.060> cap<00:03:39.299> it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
to uncap it's really difficult to cap it

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.470 
to uncap it's really difficult to cap it
since<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:40.079> slow<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.799> uncapping<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:42.000> lot

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
since that's slow and uncapping is a lot

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.720 
since that's slow and uncapping is a lot
a<00:03:42.600> lot<00:03:42.630> faster<00:03:43.019> but<00:03:43.920> as<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.069> can<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:44.400> this

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
a lot faster but as you can see this

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.270 
a lot faster but as you can see this
Guardians<00:03:45.239> very<00:03:45.690> very<00:03:45.989> stubborn<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.709> he<00:03:47.069> has

the hammer of wisdom out which is really

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.780 
the hammer of wisdom out which is really
annoying<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.859> deal<00:03:49.980> with<00:03:50.340> because<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.700> the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.190 

Mesmer<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.910> really<00:04:16.390> useful<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:17.050> have<00:04:17.140> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
Mesmer is really really useful to have a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.020 
Mesmer is really really useful to have a
midpoint<00:04:17.500> since<00:04:17.950> they<00:04:18.040> have<00:04:18.130> huge<00:04:18.550> team

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
midpoint since they have huge team

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.860 
midpoint since they have huge team
presence<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.810> huge<00:04:20.320> control<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:22.630> always

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
presence and huge control you always

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.360 
presence and huge control you always
want<00:04:23.050> them<00:04:23.170> at<00:04:23.290> your<00:04:23.410> midpoint<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:24.130> think

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
want them at your midpoint I think

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.130 
want them at your midpoint I think
that's<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.880> best<00:04:25.000> point<00:04:25.270> for<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.510> mesmer<00:04:25.870> since

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's the best point for a mesmer since

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.840 
that's the best point for a mesmer since
you<00:04:26.260> can<00:04:26.380> join<00:04:26.590> fights<00:04:26.920> at<00:04:27.160> both<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.700> other

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
you can join fights at both the other

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.380 
you can join fights at both the other
point<00:04:28.120> really<00:04:28.690> really<00:04:28.870> quickly<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:30.390> staying

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
point really really quickly and staying

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.720 
point really really quickly and staying
in<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.660> middle<00:04:31.930> he's<00:04:32.770> very<00:04:32.800> hard<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.550> take

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
in the middle he's very hard to take

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.100 
in the middle he's very hard to take
down<00:04:33.910> as<00:04:34.150> well<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:34.690> he<00:04:34.810> can<00:04:34.960> stay<00:04:35.200> on<00:04:35.230> point<00:04:37.110> now

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
down as well so he can stay on point now

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.680 
down as well so he can stay on point now
