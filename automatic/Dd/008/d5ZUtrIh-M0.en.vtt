enough<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> causes<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> body<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.780> create<00:01:57.780> some

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
enough it causes the body to create some

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
enough it causes the body to create some
kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.290> toxicity<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.009> creates<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.149> like

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
kind of toxicity that creates just like

fear<00:05:07.970> works<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.570> how<00:05:08.900> we<00:05:08.930> cuz<00:05:09.410> fear<00:05:09.740> is<00:05:09.860> what

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
fear works and how we cuz fear is what

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.530 
fear works and how we cuz fear is what
causes<00:05:10.250> us<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.490> lose<00:05:10.760> perspective<00:05:11.000> because

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
causes us to lose perspective because

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.230 
causes us to lose perspective because
fear<00:05:11.840> for<00:05:12.110> most<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.560> us<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.890> like<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:13.730> black<00:05:14.030> or

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
fear for most of us is like a black or

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.000 
fear for most of us is like a black or
white<00:05:14.390> you're<00:05:14.660> either<00:05:14.870> afraid<00:05:15.350> or<00:05:15.710> not<00:05:15.950> afraid

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
white you're either afraid or not afraid

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.960 
white you're either afraid or not afraid
it's<00:05:16.730> hard<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.330> have<00:05:17.510> a<00:05:17.540> contrast<00:05:18.380> bias<00:05:18.970> that's

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
it's hard to have a contrast bias that's

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.120 
it's hard to have a contrast bias that's
accurate<00:05:20.600> with<00:05:20.750> fear<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.320> for<00:05:21.500> example<00:05:21.890> people

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
accurate with fear so for example people

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.280 
accurate with fear so for example people
are<00:05:22.430> afraid<00:05:22.730> like<00:05:23.060> these<00:05:23.300> guys<00:05:23.600> were<00:05:23.840> afraid

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
are afraid like these guys were afraid

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.290 
are afraid like these guys were afraid
they<00:05:24.500> knew<00:05:24.680> if<00:05:24.830> they<00:05:24.860> didn't<00:05:25.280> answer<00:05:25.580> the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
they knew if they didn't answer the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.290 
they knew if they didn't answer the
interrogators<00:05:27.340> question<00:05:28.340> correctly<00:05:28.850> they

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
interrogators question correctly they

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600 
interrogators question correctly they
might<00:05:29.540> have<00:05:29.810> whatever<00:05:30.170> bamboo<00:05:30.800> slivers<00:05:31.340> put

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
might have whatever bamboo slivers put

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.400 
might have whatever bamboo slivers put
under<00:05:31.880> their<00:05:32.030> fingers<00:05:32.420> tortured<00:05:32.990> so<00:05:33.230> that's

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
under their fingers tortured so that's

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.430 
under their fingers tortured so that's
one<00:05:33.650> level<00:05:33.860> fear<00:05:34.510> you<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.810> are<00:05:36.080> probably

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
one level fear you and I are probably

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.550 
one level fear you and I are probably
not<00:05:36.770> experiencing<00:05:37.340> any<00:05:37.460> level<00:05:38.210> of<00:05:38.560> potential

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
not experiencing any level of potential

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.410 
not experiencing any level of potential
consequences<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.610> but<00:05:40.850> we<00:05:40.940> still<00:05:41.210> have

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
consequences like that but we still have

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.230 
consequences like that but we still have
the<00:05:41.600> same<00:05:41.870> fear<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.520> research<00:05:43.970> as<00:05:44.150> I

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
the same fear and so this research as I

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.970 
the same fear and so this research as I
forget<00:05:44.510> which<00:05:44.630> textbook<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.230> read<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.560> they

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
forget which textbook I read it they

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.790 
forget which textbook I read it they
basically<00:05:46.340> said<00:05:46.670> look<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:48.200> reason<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.680> don't

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
basically said look the reason you don't

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.110 
basically said look the reason you don't
have<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.100> be<00:05:49.220> so<00:05:49.460> fear-based

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
have to be so fear-based

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.460 
have to be so fear-based
is<00:05:51.040> simple<00:05:52.040> your<00:05:52.760> mind<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.630> your<00:05:54.170> tolerance

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
is simple your mind and your tolerance

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.830 
is simple your mind and your tolerance
will<00:05:55.010> rise<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.730> occasion<00:05:56.090> people<00:05:56.630> for

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
will rise to the occasion people for

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.100 
will rise to the occasion people for
example<00:05:56.930> who<00:05:57.290> are<00:05:57.320> paraplegic<00:05:58.960> you<00:05:59.960> would

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
and I was thinking what kind of

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.620 
and I was thinking what kind of
perspective<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:52.610> not<00:06:53.000> to<00:06:53.120> pick<00:06:53.330> on<00:06:53.480> them

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
perspective and not to pick on them

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.940 
perspective and not to pick on them
maybe<00:06:53.870> there's<00:06:54.110> something<00:06:54.320> going<00:06:54.560> on<00:06:54.740> that<00:06:54.800> I

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
maybe there's something going on that I

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.100 
maybe there's something going on that I
didn't<00:06:55.190> know<00:06:55.310> but<00:06:55.550> what<00:06:56.090> kind<00:06:56.330> of<00:06:56.389> perspective

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
didn't know but what kind of perspective

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.710 
didn't know but what kind of perspective
is<00:06:57.380> it<00:06:57.590> where<00:06:57.800> your<00:06:57.950> big<00:06:58.340> trauma<00:06:58.880> in<00:06:59.210> life<00:06:59.450> is
