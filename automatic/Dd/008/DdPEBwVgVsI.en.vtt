00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 Welcome to planet 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.180
 today we are going to make a puzzle for it 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.690
 we're going to need ice cream sticks or 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.700
 depressors glue scissors or a cutter 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.700
 and a drawing that you want 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.949
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.080
 is going to be pick up our little sticks 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.020
 ice cream we can catch them all the same 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.800
 color or different colors and our 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.930
 image 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.510
 we have printed this and we have 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.540
 colored you can do the same 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.910
 print one or take a photo or 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.860
 draw it yourselves 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 from the back we will be giving 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 glue 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.850
 if you want so that we do not spoil 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.400
 of the table we put a folio and so do not 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 we stumble we will give good of 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.030
 glue 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.410
 very well stuck and we are going to stick 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.090
 here all the sticks 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.090
 we start for example with the white 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.850
 then we put the yellow for example 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 you have to paste the more or less aligned 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.509
 and fine dots 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.509
 the orange 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.540
 careful when we have some crime or 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.670
 something smaller so that it does not 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 we stay there bent 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.130
 and let's put the last stick 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.150
 we raise 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.369
 and we see if our little animal is well 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.409
 stuck if we see that somewhere not 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.920
 is well enough stuck you 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.450
 we take out more glue and reinforce it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.970
 for example here the little ear happens to us what 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 same we put a little bit more than 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.500
 glue and squeeze 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.220
 if you want we could also put the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.220
 plastic to make it more resistant 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 cover it now what we are going to do is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.210
 turn it around 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 either with scissors or with a cutter 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.370
 let's cut out for each side of the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.270
 stick for the little ones is easier 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.460
 with scissors 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.460
 so let's get the scissors 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.330
 and cutting the stick 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 care as you see is super important 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.440
 that is well stuck we move it and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.980
 we continue with the following 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.980
 we cut 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.409
 and so we are staying 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.930
 the different parts 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.610
 we 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.819
 it's faster with a box cutter but 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.069
 good if you still follow a little bit if 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.680
 You can not use the cutter as we use 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.800
 the scissors and we have a little bit more 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.800
 patience 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 and the last 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.880
 very well 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.490
 Well, it would simply be to assemble 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.770
 puzzle we put all the parts by the 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.150
 part that has the drawing and it would be 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.150
 question of riding it 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.799
 we are placing and we are getting 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.799
 our doll 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.610
 if the children are too small and 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.860
 they still do not know how to locate the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.500
 we can put the pieces 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.280
 behind some numbers to facilitate you 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.280
 more work 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.599
 and this would be our puzzle 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.250
 made with ice cream sticks 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.040
 and here our craft today 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.020
 see you later planetarians 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.110
 if you liked this video because it is not 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.220
