Thunder<00:00:29.179> looks<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.300> it'd<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.510> attached<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
Thunder looks like it'd be attached a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.060 
Thunder looks like it'd be attached a
little<00:00:31.439> bit<00:00:31.529> better<00:00:33.590> looks<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:34.920> might

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
little bit better looks like there might

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
little bit better looks like there might
be<00:00:35.130> something<00:00:35.730> missing<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.390> too<00:00:37.040> looks

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:01:15.000 

and<00:00:46.960> here's<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.920> damage

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.340 

you<00:01:16.010> can<00:01:16.159> see<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:16.400> side

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can see this side

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.789 
you can see this side
he's<00:01:18.650> not<00:01:18.950> square

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.800 

you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.759> bump<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.079> fold<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you know bump out here fold there the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.679 
you know bump out here fold there the
biggest<00:01:29.179> correction<00:01:30.179> I<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
biggest correction I want to make is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.770 
biggest correction I want to make is
this<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.289> dents<00:01:32.039> in<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.780> makes

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this when it dents in here makes

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.039 
this when it dents in here makes
everything<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.560> tight<00:01:34.679> underneath<00:01:36.049> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
everything really tight underneath the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.389 
everything really tight underneath the
splash<00:01:37.590> guard<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:39.079> hitting<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.409> AC<00:01:40.920> pulley

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
splash guard was hitting the AC pulley

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:49.330 
splash guard was hitting the AC pulley
you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.890> here

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.830 

you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.430> there's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:53.270> hole<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.300> for<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you know there's a hole here for the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.410 
you know there's a hole here for the
splash<00:01:55.080> guard<00:01:56.360> hole<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:58.760> hold<00:01:59.760> there<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.420> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
splash guard hole here hold there and of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.290 
splash guard hole here hold there and of
course<00:02:03.690> it's<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:03.990> straight<00:02:05.030> that's<00:02:06.030> why<00:02:06.210> this

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
course it's not straight that's why this

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.290 
course it's not straight that's why this
dent<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> here

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.480 

hopefully<00:02:10.140> we'll<00:02:10.320> be<00:02:10.470> corrected

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.380 

so<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.600> have<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> splash<00:02:15.110> guard<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
so I can have a splash guard and have a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.940 
so I can have a splash guard and have a
little<00:02:17.600> bit<00:02:17.690> better<00:02:17.780> access<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.740> know<00:02:18.800> this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
little bit better access you know this

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.510 
little bit better access you know this
this<00:02:19.220> idler<00:02:19.670> bolt<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.210> almost<00:02:20.690> touching<00:02:20.990> I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
this idler bolt is almost touching I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:36.510 
this idler bolt is almost touching I
mean<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.580> practically<00:02:23.210> is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.460 

so<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.330> see<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.720> dent<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.260> that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so there you can see that dent in that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.410 
so there you can see that dent in that
way

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.830 

and<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.050> underside<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> bumper

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.430 

see<00:02:51.470> there

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.089 

so<00:02:54.800> hopefully<00:02:55.070> for<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.089 

for<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.670> pro<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.420> hope<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.319> don't<00:03:01.769> know<00:03:01.980> if

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
for a pro I hope that I don't know if

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.209 
for a pro I hope that I don't know if
it's<00:03:02.510> too<00:03:03.510> far<00:03:03.719> gone<00:03:03.780> or<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:06.530> these<00:03:07.530> two<00:03:07.739> bolts

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
it's too far gone or not these two bolts

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.690 
it's too far gone or not these two bolts
just<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.849> be<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.269> bit<00:03:09.810> further<00:03:10.079> apart<00:03:10.319> for<00:03:10.950> guess

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
just to be a bit further apart for guess

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.660 
just to be a bit further apart for guess
that's<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.329> then<00:03:12.930> EVAP<00:03:13.409> canister

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
that's it and then EVAP canister

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:23.690 
that's it and then EVAP canister
mounting<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.980> bust<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:22.609> oddly<00:03:23.609> enough

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
mounting there bust it off oddly enough

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.580 
mounting there bust it off oddly enough
this<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.299> bracket<00:03:24.659> that<00:03:24.750> was<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.109> fender

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this out bracket that was on this fender

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.729 
this out bracket that was on this fender
seemed<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.250> be<00:03:26.340> okay<00:03:26.669> in<00:03:26.909> a<00:03:27.150> decent<00:03:27.510> position

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
seemed to be okay in a decent position

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.839 
seemed to be okay in a decent position
the<00:03:28.739> brackets<00:03:29.099> missing<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.489> other<00:03:29.609> side

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
the brackets missing on the other side

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.780 
the brackets missing on the other side
but<00:03:30.629> this<00:03:30.780> side<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.290> all<00:03:31.469> bent<00:03:31.709> up<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.040> that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
but this side it's all bent up but that

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:53.020 
but this side it's all bent up but that
still<00:03:33.090> seemed<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.419> line<00:03:33.599> up<00:03:34.250> okay

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.100 

and<00:03:53.540> those<00:03:53.720> bolts<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.200> there<00:03:55.360> right<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.660> think

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
and those bolts in there right I think

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.690 
and those bolts in there right I think
they're<00:03:57.260> supposed<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.770> flat<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.310> pointing

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
they're supposed to be flat and pointing

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:39.659 
they're supposed to be flat and pointing
both<00:03:58.910> straight<00:03:59.330> ahead

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.400 

pretty<00:04:40.669> tight<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.090> there<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:45.020> see<00:04:45.229> down

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
pretty tight in there you can see down

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.290 
pretty tight in there you can see down
to<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:45.740> tensioner<00:04:46.220> bolt<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.789> just<00:04:47.060> about

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
to that tensioner bolt it is just about

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.580 
to that tensioner bolt it is just about
touching<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.870> thing<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.169> bolt<00:04:48.349> doesn't

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
touching the thing that bolt doesn't

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.200 
touching the thing that bolt doesn't
spin<00:04:49.449> but<00:04:50.449> uh<00:04:51.220> yeah<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.490> little<00:04:52.759> bit<00:04:52.880> tricky

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
spin but uh yeah a little bit tricky

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.629 
spin but uh yeah a little bit tricky
getting<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.599> belt<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:54.130> when<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.250> fender<00:04:55.520> was

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
getting this belt on when the fender was

getting this belt on when the fender was
on<00:04:55.789> anyway<00:04:56.169> should<00:04:57.169> have<00:04:57.259> waited<00:04:57.440> until<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:59.150> had

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
on anyway should have waited until I had

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.620 
on anyway should have waited until I had
the<00:04:59.389> fender<00:04:59.690> off<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.050> do<00:05:00.199> all<00:05:00.349> that<00:05:01.599> that<00:05:02.599> uh

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
the fender off to do all that that uh

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.189 
the fender off to do all that that uh
the<00:05:03.759> engine<00:05:04.759> mount<00:05:04.970> in<00:05:05.150> there<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:08.139> don't<00:05:09.139> know

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
the engine mount in there I don't know

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.379 
the engine mount in there I don't know
it<00:05:09.380> an<00:05:10.280> engine<00:05:10.610> now<00:05:10.759> it<00:05:10.819> doesn't<00:05:11.030> look<00:05:11.210> too

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
it an engine now it doesn't look too

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:25.770 
it an engine now it doesn't look too
great<00:05:19.449> it's<00:05:20.449> hard<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:20.720> tell<00:05:20.930> from<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:22.580> side

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.420 

and<00:05:26.780> bushing<00:05:27.169> them<00:05:27.289> destroyed<00:05:28.039> or<00:05:28.250> anything

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
and bushing them destroyed or anything

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:37.210 
and bushing them destroyed or anything
but<00:05:34.930> just<00:05:35.930> tell<00:05:36.229> everything's<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.710> there<00:05:36.889> a

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
but just tell everything's in there a

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:46.290 
but just tell everything's in there a
little<00:05:38.150> bit<00:05:38.270> tighter<00:05:38.509> than<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:38.840> ought<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:38.990> be

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.830 

but<00:05:46.900> hopefully<00:05:47.789> can<00:05:48.789> find<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.150> professional

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
but hopefully can find a professional

00:05:49.840 --> 00:06:10.500 
but hopefully can find a professional
they<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.169> pull<00:05:50.349> that<00:05:50.500> out<00:05:50.560> for<00:05:50.919> me

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:20.900 

just<00:06:11.020> a<00:06:11.110> little<00:06:11.320> cracking<00:06:11.980> there

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.760 

I<00:06:21.000> think<00:06:21.570> that's<00:06:21.750> just<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:22.110> maybe<00:06:22.290> a<00:06:22.410> little

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
I think that's just it maybe a little

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.290 
I think that's just it maybe a little
bit<00:06:22.890> dented<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.370> right<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:23.820> and<00:06:23.850> it<00:06:24.150> looks

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
bit dented in right there and it looks

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.909 
bit dented in right there and it looks
like<00:06:24.390> no<00:06:24.600> big<00:06:24.810> deal

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:42.500 

other<00:06:29.400> side<00:06:29.669> looks<00:06:29.909> pretty<00:06:30.360> good

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.360 

and<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:43.020> just<00:06:43.170> looks<00:06:43.410> maybe<00:06:43.650> dented<00:06:44.100> in<00:06:44.220> right

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
and it just looks maybe dented in right

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.700 
and it just looks maybe dented in right
there

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.029 

my<00:06:51.710> side<00:06:51.949> nice<00:06:52.550> and<00:06:52.580> straight
