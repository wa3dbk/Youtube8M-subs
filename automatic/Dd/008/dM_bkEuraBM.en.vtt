00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.790 
guide to the Adept for Mass Effect 2
now<00:00:09.580> last<00:00:09.880> video<00:00:10.180> was<00:00:10.870> an<00:00:10.990> intro<00:00:11.320> and<00:00:11.470> also<00:00:11.770> a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
now last video was an intro and also a

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.009 
now last video was an intro and also a
brief<00:00:12.190> look<00:00:12.400> back<00:00:12.430> to<00:00:12.820> Mass<00:00:13.000> Effect<00:00:13.390> 1<00:00:13.720> I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
brief look back to Mass Effect 1 I

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.930 
brief look back to Mass Effect 1 I
thought<00:00:14.440> at<00:00:14.559> first<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:14.980> adept<00:00:15.340> was<00:00:15.550> a<00:00:15.580> little

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
thought at first the adept was a little

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.210 
thought at first the adept was a little
too<00:00:16.180> prissy<00:00:16.750> for<00:00:17.019> Shepard<00:00:17.349> I<00:00:17.500> really<00:00:18.010> felt

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
too prissy for Shepard I really felt

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.080 
too prissy for Shepard I really felt
that<00:00:18.280> Vanguard<00:00:18.730> was<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:18.910> only

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
that Vanguard was the only

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.300 
that Vanguard was the only
self-respecting<00:00:19.840> way<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.050> be<00:00:20.289> a<00:00:20.320> biotic<00:00:20.710> and<00:00:21.039> I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
self-respecting way to be a biotic and I

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.650 
self-respecting way to be a biotic and I
only<00:00:21.520> play<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:21.880> depth<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.360> that<00:00:22.390> I<00:00:22.510> could

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
only play to depth so that I could

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.779 
only play to depth so that I could
unlock<00:00:22.930> singularity<00:00:23.680> but<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.190> got<00:00:24.340> addicted<00:00:24.580> to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
unlock singularity but I got addicted to

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.120 
unlock singularity but I got addicted to
the<00:00:24.880> class<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.539> I<00:00:25.810> gotta<00:00:26.020> say<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:26.500> is<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.650> lot<00:00:26.980> of

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the class and I gotta say it is a lot of

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.519 
the class and I gotta say it is a lot of
fun<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:27.580> in<00:00:27.730> Mass<00:00:27.910> Effect<00:00:27.940> 2<00:00:28.330> it<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:29.020> think<00:00:29.380> is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
fun and in Mass Effect 2 it I think is

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.339 
fun and in Mass Effect 2 it I think is
even<00:00:29.710> more<00:00:29.859> fun<00:00:30.400> now<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.359> gameplay<00:00:31.630> changes

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
even more fun now the gameplay changes

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.899 
even more fun now the gameplay changes
to<00:00:32.500> Mass<00:00:32.649> Effect<00:00:33.039> 2<00:00:33.100> from<00:00:33.370> Mass<00:00:33.519> Effect<00:00:33.760> 1

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:33.909 
to Mass Effect 2 from Mass Effect 1

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.169 
to Mass Effect 2 from Mass Effect 1
affected<00:00:34.359> all<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.629> classes<00:00:35.170> obviously<00:00:36.179> but

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
affected all the classes obviously but

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:38.880 
affected all the classes obviously but
the<00:00:37.269> ones<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.539> particularly<00:00:38.079> deal<00:00:38.620> with<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
the ones that particularly deal with the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.299 
the ones that particularly deal with the
adept<00:00:39.219> class<00:00:39.519> are<00:00:39.879> these<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:41.170> skills<00:00:41.589> now<00:00:42.069> are

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
adept class are these the skills now are

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.939 
adept class are these the skills now are
all<00:00:42.519> on<00:00:42.729> the<00:00:42.819> same<00:00:43.120> reset<00:00:43.870> timer<00:00:44.199> in<00:00:44.739> Mass

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
all on the same reset timer in Mass

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.829 
all on the same reset timer in Mass
Effect<00:00:44.979> 1<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.699> skills<00:00:45.969> were<00:00:46.120> all<00:00:46.269> on<00:00:46.449> separate

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
Effect 1 the skills were all on separate

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.450 
Effect 1 the skills were all on separate
recharge<00:00:47.260> timers<00:00:47.739> but<00:00:48.069> I<00:00:48.159> meant<00:00:48.309> for<00:00:48.399> the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
recharge timers but I meant for the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.979 
recharge timers but I meant for the
adept<00:00:48.729> was<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:49.030> could<00:00:49.179> toss<00:00:49.359> somebody<00:00:49.780> into<00:00:49.960> a

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
adept was you could toss somebody into a

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.569 
adept was you could toss somebody into a
wall<00:00:50.229> lift<00:00:50.829> somebody<00:00:51.249> could<00:00:51.460> pull

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
wall lift somebody could pull

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.520 
wall lift somebody could pull
singularity<00:00:52.269> you<00:00:52.539> could<00:00:52.659> pull<00:00:52.870> warp<00:00:53.139> and<00:00:53.440> then

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
singularity you could pull warp and then

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.750 
singularity you could pull warp and then
you<00:00:53.589> can<00:00:53.709> shoot<00:00:53.859> some<00:00:54.010> stuff<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.429> throw<00:00:54.609> on<00:00:54.699> a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
you can shoot some stuff you throw on a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.639 
you can shoot some stuff you throw on a
barrier<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.449> it<00:00:55.539> all<00:00:55.780> at<00:00:55.959> the<00:00:56.079> same<00:00:56.289> time

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
barrier you do it all at the same time

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.529 
barrier you do it all at the same time
or<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.949> very<00:00:57.190> quick<00:00:57.760> succession

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
or a very quick succession

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.379 
or a very quick succession
Mass<00:00:59.139> Effect<00:00:59.170> 2<00:00:59.499> however<00:00:59.920> all<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.999> skills<00:01:01.269> are

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389 
Mass Effect 2 however all the skills are

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.090 
Mass Effect 2 however all the skills are
on<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.569> same<00:01:01.809> recharge<00:01:02.350> timer<00:01:02.679> as<00:01:02.829> soon<00:01:02.859> as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
on the same recharge timer as soon as

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.950 
on the same recharge timer as soon as
you<00:01:03.219> use<00:01:03.399> one<00:01:03.729> you<00:01:03.999> have<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.269> wait<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.510> second<00:01:04.869> or

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
you use one you have to wait a second or

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.290 
you use one you have to wait a second or
two<00:01:05.140> until<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.860> whole<00:01:06.160> skillset<00:01:06.790> recharges

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
two until the whole skillset recharges

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.640 
two until the whole skillset recharges
and<00:01:07.330> then<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.600> get<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.870> use<00:01:07.990> another<00:01:08.290> skill

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
and then you get to use another skill

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.870 
and then you get to use another skill
essentially<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.310> only<00:01:09.430> get<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.730> use<00:01:09.850> one

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
essentially you only get to use one

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.090 
essentially you only get to use one
skill<00:01:10.480> every<00:01:10.600> couple<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.020> seconds<00:01:11.410> means<00:01:12.010> you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
skill every couple of seconds means you

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.950 
skill every couple of seconds means you
have<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.400> lot<00:01:12.670> more<00:01:12.850> precise<00:01:13.270> about<00:01:13.570> what

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
have to be a lot more precise about what

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960 
have to be a lot more precise about what
you<00:01:14.140> want<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.440> use<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.920> why<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.820> my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
you want to use and why and in my

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.220 
you want to use and why and in my
experience<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.480> Mass<00:01:16.630> Effect<00:01:16.930> 2<00:01:16.990> that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
experience with Mass Effect 2 that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.900 
experience with Mass Effect 2 that
generally<00:01:17.680> ends<00:01:17.890> up<00:01:18.010> meaning<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.610> use

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
generally ends up meaning that you use

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.480 
generally ends up meaning that you use
the<00:01:19.150> same<00:01:19.180> kind<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:20.050> skill<00:01:20.320> over<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.890> over<00:01:21.310> or

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the same kind of skill over and over or

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.370 
the same kind of skill over and over or
you<00:01:21.970> end<00:01:22.150> up<00:01:22.300> using<00:01:22.480> one<00:01:22.810> skill<00:01:23.080> for<00:01:23.260> this

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
you end up using one skill for this

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.630 
you end up using one skill for this
situation<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.890> one<00:01:24.070> skill<00:01:24.340> for<00:01:24.520> this

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
situation of one skill for this

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.700 
situation of one skill for this
situation<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.570> lot<00:01:25.750> less<00:01:25.990> throw

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
situation it's a lot less throw

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.470 
situation it's a lot less throw
everything<00:01:27.040> at<00:01:27.370> him<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.730> a<00:01:27.790> lot<00:01:27.940> more<00:01:28.000> let's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
everything at him and a lot more let's

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.610 
everything at him and a lot more let's
be<00:01:28.630> pretty<00:01:28.840> precise<00:01:29.170> about<00:01:29.350> it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
be pretty precise about it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.200 
be pretty precise about it
that's<00:01:29.860> very<00:01:29.980> true<00:01:30.220> for<00:01:30.250> all<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.700> classes<00:01:31.090> I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
that's very true for all the classes I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850 
that's very true for all the classes I
think<00:01:31.240> but<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.020> think<00:01:32.170> especially<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
think but I think especially for the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.320 
think but I think especially for the
adept<00:01:33.190> because<00:01:33.550> your<00:01:33.730> skills<00:01:34.000> are<00:01:34.150> so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
adept because your skills are so

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.400 
adept because your skills are so
powerful<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.900> have<00:01:35.080> things<00:01:35.350> like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
powerful and you have things like

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.260 
powerful and you have things like
singularity<00:01:36.250> but<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.730> other<00:01:36.850> things<00:01:37.120> that

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
singularity but the other things that

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.390 
singularity but the other things that
affected<00:01:37.540> all<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.930> classes<00:01:38.410> was<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
affected all the classes was the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.560 
affected all the classes was the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
cannon fire so you have at least one

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
warp up your sleeve the downside though

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.680 
warp up your sleeve the downside though
of<00:02:30.400> course<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.030> adept<00:02:31.270> has<00:02:31.450> less

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
of course is that the adept has less

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.360 
of course is that the adept has less
guns<00:02:32.050> than<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.410> other<00:02:32.530> classes<00:02:32.830> do<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
guns than the other classes do so you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 
guns than the other classes do so you
have<00:02:33.550> less<00:02:33.760> shot<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> biggest<00:02:34.960> thing

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
have less shot but the biggest thing

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.480 
have less shot but the biggest thing
that<00:02:35.230> you're<00:02:35.440> gonna<00:02:35.530> run<00:02:35.740> into<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.340> Mass

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.730 
Effect 2 that affects the Adept Li's I
think<00:02:38.380> so

think so

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.830 
think so
is<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.220> protection<00:02:39.640> system<00:02:40.240> that's<00:02:40.480> going<00:02:40.630> on

is the protection system that's going on

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.990 
is the protection system that's going on

throw pull and singularity are pretty

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.060 
throw pull and singularity are pretty
darn<00:03:54.940> useful<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.930> basically<00:03:56.350> ends<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.800> meaning

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
darn useful it basically ends up meaning

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
ammo and it is also weak to warp they're

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.740 
ammo and it is also weak to warp they're
not<00:04:57.370> quite<00:04:57.760> as<00:04:57.789> weak<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.150> warp<00:04:58.330> as<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.570> might

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
not quite as weak to warp as you might

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.690 
not quite as weak to warp as you might
like<00:04:58.990> it's<00:04:59.560> not<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> complete<00:05:00.160> list<00:05:00.340> but<00:05:00.580> that's

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
like it's not a complete list but that's

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.100 
like it's not a complete list but that's
kind<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.000> good<00:05:01.090> overview<00:05:01.600> for<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.840> Adept

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
kind of a good overview for the Adept

because you're gonna notice that the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.400 
because you're gonna notice that the
adepts<00:05:03.850> skill<00:05:04.120> of<00:05:04.270> warp<00:05:04.539> takes<00:05:04.870> care<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.110> two

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
adepts skill of warp takes care of two

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.870 
adepts skill of warp takes care of two
of<00:05:05.590> those<00:05:05.680> three<00:05:05.919> protection<00:05:06.460> problems

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
of those three protection problems

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.520 
of those three protection problems
namely<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.419> can<00:05:07.600> take<00:05:07.810> out<00:05:07.930> armor<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.500> can

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
namely it can take out armor and it can

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.409 
namely it can take out armor and it can
take<00:05:08.830> out<00:05:09.010> biotic<00:05:09.400> barriers<00:05:09.789> so<00:05:10.390> that

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
take out biotic barriers so that

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.029 
take out biotic barriers so that
basically<00:05:10.720> means<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:11.229> your<00:05:11.440> real<00:05:11.620> challenge

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
basically means that your real challenge

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.740 
basically means that your real challenge
then<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.340> going<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.700> getting<00:05:12.850> past<00:05:13.150> shields

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
then is going to be getting past shields

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.360 
then is going to be getting past shields
so<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:13.990> can<00:05:14.289> again<00:05:14.500> get<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.890> juicy<00:05:15.070> meat

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
so you can again get to the juicy meat

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.130 
so you can again get to the juicy meat
