00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
definitely was the most frustrating call

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.260

I can't<00:04:24.139> live<00:04:24.440> stream<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:24.860> twitch<00:04:25.130> TV<00:04:25.340> because

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
I can't live stream on twitch TV because

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.910 
I can't live stream on twitch TV because
I<00:04:26.120> think<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.720> actually<00:04:26.870> get<00:04:27.170> like<00:04:27.290> IP<00:04:27.500> banned
