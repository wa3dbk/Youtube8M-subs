little bit about how to convert your

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.410 
little bit about how to convert your
photos<00:00:09.269> your<00:00:09.480> RGB<00:00:09.960> images<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.099> CMYK<00:00:11.610> color

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
photos your RGB images to the CMYK color

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.550 
photos your RGB images to the CMYK color
space<00:00:13.549> CMYK<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> color<00:00:15.809> space<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
space CMYK is the color space that is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.420 
space CMYK is the color space that is
used<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:17.300> printing<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.740> RGB<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> color

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
used for printing and RGB is a color

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.210 
used for printing and RGB is a color
space<00:00:20.730> that's<00:00:21.029> used<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.710> viewing<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.830> screen

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
space that's used for viewing on screen

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.089 
space that's used for viewing on screen
it's<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> working<00:00:23.880> space<00:00:24.800> they're<00:00:25.800> slightly

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
it's a working space they're slightly

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's a working space they're slightly
different<00:00:26.250> obviously<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.150> terms<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.480> additive

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
different obviously in terms of additive

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.089 
different obviously in terms of additive
and<00:00:27.960> subtractive<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:28.740> really<00:00:28.890> care

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and subtractive we don't really care

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.290 
and subtractive we don't really care
about<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.550> much<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
about that so much but what I want to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.720 
about that so much but what I want to
talk<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> different

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
talk to you about is the different

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.819 
talk to you about is the different
flavors<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> CMYK<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.260> convert<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
flavors of CMYK that you can convert to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
flavors of CMYK that you can convert to
and<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> misconceptions<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.989> are

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and some of the misconceptions that are

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.560 
and some of the misconceptions that are
around<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> okay<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.360> talk

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
around that okay so first let's talk

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.990 
around that okay so first let's talk
about<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.050> different<00:00:40.559> color<00:00:41.010> settings<00:00:41.579> let's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
about the different color settings let's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
about the different color settings let's
talk<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> color<00:00:42.570> spaces<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.290> are

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
talk about the color spaces that are

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670 
talk about the color spaces that are
available<00:00:43.800> okay<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> long

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
available okay so you can see a long

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
available okay so you can see a long
list<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.820> available<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
list of them that are available in the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.229 
list of them that are available in the
color<00:00:49.530> settings<00:00:49.920> dialog<00:00:50.280> box<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.329> standard

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
color settings dialog box the standard

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.200 
color settings dialog box the standard
CMYK<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.840> guess<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> could<00:00:55.920> say<00:00:56.129> anniversay<00:00:57.090> as

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
CMYK I guess you could say anniversay as

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.340 
CMYK I guess you could say anniversay as
a<00:00:57.239> standard<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> most<00:00:58.579> common<00:01:00.350> CMYK

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
a standard but the most common CMYK

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
a standard but the most common CMYK
color<00:01:01.680> space<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:02.160> used<00:01:02.430> would<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.090> web

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
color space that's used would be the web

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.800 
color space that's used would be the web
coated<00:01:03.870> swop<00:01:04.260> standards<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> web<00:01:05.369> offset

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
coated swop standards for web offset

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
coated swop standards for web offset
printing<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> version<00:01:07.530> 2<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.250> let's<00:01:08.580> talk

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
printing this is version 2 so let's talk

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.649 
printing this is version 2 so let's talk
a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> difference

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a little bit about the difference

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
a little bit about the difference
between<00:01:09.689> web<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> sheetfed<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.430> all

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
between web and sheetfed first of all

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.649 
between web and sheetfed first of all
okay<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.810> there's<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:14.040> main

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
okay so there's really two main

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
okay so there's really two main
different<00:01:15.659> types<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.170> printing<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.340> are

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
different types of printing that are

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
different types of printing that are
done<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> world<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> there's<00:01:19.650> web

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
done in the world and there's web

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140 
done in the world and there's web
printing<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.340> sheetfed<00:01:20.520> printing

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
printing and sheetfed printing

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.800 
printing and sheetfed printing
web<00:01:21.540> printing<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.530> magazines<00:01:23.810> for

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
web printing would be for magazines for

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
web printing would be for magazines for
flyers<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.070> anything<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.729> done

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
flyers really for anything that is done

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
flyers really for anything that is done
at<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.330> high<00:01:28.229> volume<00:01:28.619> printing

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
at a very high volume printing

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.390 
at a very high volume printing
environment<00:01:30.090> generally<00:01:30.990> above<00:01:31.710> twenty

thousand fifteen to twenty thousand is
where<00:01:34.500> web<00:01:34.740> starts<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.220> kick<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> mean<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
where web starts to kick in I mean I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
where web starts to kick in I mean I
know<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.600> sheetfed<00:01:36.900> presses<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
know some sheetfed presses can go up to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
know some sheetfed presses can go up to
thirty<00:01:38.340> forty<00:01:38.670> fifty<00:01:38.759> thousand<00:01:39.420> but

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
thirty forty fifty thousand but

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.760 
thirty forty fifty thousand but
economics<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> scale<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.400> web<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
economics of scale the web which is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.380 
economics of scale the web which is
different<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.520> feed<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
different in that it doesn't feed the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
different in that it doesn't feed the
paper<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> sheet<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.700> started

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
paper through in a sheet it's it started

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.260 
paper through in a sheet it's it started
out<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.570> big<00:01:49.170> roll<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.549> quality<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
out on a big roll and the quality of the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
out on a big roll and the quality of the
paper<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.750> often<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.369> lower<00:01:53.880> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
paper is often much not much lower but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
paper is often much not much lower but
certainly<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.720> lower<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.829> speed<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
certainly can be lower and the speed of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.609 
certainly can be lower and the speed of
the<00:01:56.399> press<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.909> much<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.479> faster<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the press is much much faster now as a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.149 
the press is much much faster now as a
result<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> speed<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.630> needs<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
result of the speed it needs to have a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
result of the speed it needs to have a
ink<00:02:02.610> limit<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.240> much<00:02:03.479> lower<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
ink limit that's much lower so you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
ink limit that's much lower so you
notice<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.799> mouse<00:02:05.130> over<00:02:05.310> there

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
notice when I put my mouse over there

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.560 
notice when I put my mouse over there
down<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.969> bottom<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> description

down in this area we have a total ink
area<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.440> 300<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> maximum<00:02:12.360> amount

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.039 
Vinc that can be my hat in a web profile
if<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.069> look<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.489> sheetfed<00:02:17.790> we've<00:02:18.750> now

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
if we look at the sheetfed we've now

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.300 
if we look at the sheetfed we've now
gone<00:02:19.560> upwards<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.489> range<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.030> 350<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.650> what

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
gone upwards in the range of 350 so what

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.100 
gone upwards in the range of 350 so what
does<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.459> mean<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.450> means<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:24.989> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
does that mean that means that if you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
does that mean that means that if you
add<00:02:25.379> up<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.799> darkest<00:02:26.400> black<00:02:26.730> region<00:02:27.329> in<00:02:27.689> that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
add up the darkest black region in that

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
add up the darkest black region in that
image<00:02:28.230> those<00:02:29.159> four<00:02:29.730> inks<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.269> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.629> add

up to three hundred and fifty percent
all<00:02:33.480> four<00:02:33.959> inks<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:35.099> add<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.700> four

all four inks if you add up all four
inks<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.329> web<00:02:36.510> you'll<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.290> much<00:02:37.470> lower

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
inks in the web you'll have much lower

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
inks in the web you'll have much lower
now<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:38.129> we<00:02:38.220> go<00:02:38.340> down<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.519> newsprint<00:02:39.180> again

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
now if we go down to newsprint again

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.360 
now if we go down to newsprint again
we're<00:02:40.200> gonna<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.470> lower<00:02:40.680> one<00:02:40.859> again<00:02:41.099> two

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
we're gonna have a lower one again two

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.490 
we're gonna have a lower one again two
hundred<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.819> twenty<00:02:42.299> totaling<00:02:42.720> covers<00:02:43.109> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
hundred and twenty totaling covers so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.309 
hundred and twenty totaling covers so
it's<00:02:43.680> how<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.849> black<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.540> created<00:02:46.139> and<00:02:46.290> how

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
it's how the black is created and how

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.589 
it's how the black is created and how
the<00:02:46.440> four<00:02:46.799> other<00:02:47.220> three<00:02:47.579> colors<00:02:47.940> are<00:02:48.209> created

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
the four other three colors are created

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.349 
the four other three colors are created
in<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.989> dark<00:02:49.230> regions<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.889> black<00:02:50.359> how

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
in the dark regions and the black how

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.140 
in the dark regions and the black how
much<00:02:51.629> K<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.230> used<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.799> Converse<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.819> see<00:02:54.030> my

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
much K is used in Converse to the see my

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.809 
much K is used in Converse to the see my
okay<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.409> there's<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.709> different<00:02:56.040> conversion

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
okay so there's a different conversion

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.300 
okay so there's a different conversion
formula<00:02:57.239> for<00:02:57.420> each<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.230> need<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.920> find<00:02:59.099> out

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
formula for each so you need to find out

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.369 
formula for each so you need to find out
where<00:02:59.700> your<00:02:59.879> images<00:03:00.239> are<00:03:00.389> going<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.349> don't

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
where your images are going if you don't

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.530 
where your images are going if you don't
know<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:02.879> idea<00:03:03.209> where<00:03:03.389> your

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
know if you have no idea where your

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.259 
know if you have no idea where your
images<00:03:03.870> are<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.319> your<00:03:04.799> safest<00:03:05.400> bet<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
images are going your safest bet is to

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.420 
images are going your safest bet is to
print<00:03:06.629> or<00:03:06.959> convert<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.859> us<00:03:08.159> web<00:03:08.400> coated

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
print or convert to the us web coated

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.339 
print or convert to the us web coated
it's<00:03:09.180> probably<00:03:09.689> considered<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.170> most

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
it's probably considered the most

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.800 
it's probably considered the most
universal<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.099> us<00:03:11.879> web<00:03:12.060> coated<00:03:12.150> version<00:03:12.720> two

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
universal and us web coated version two

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.509 
universal and us web coated version two
is<00:03:12.900> probably<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.379> most<00:03:13.620> amount<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.189> printing

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
is probably the most amount of printing

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.360 
is probably the most amount of printing
that<00:03:14.639> is<00:03:14.700> done<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.209> North<00:03:15.420> America<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:17.099> you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
that is done in North America so if you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.059 
that is done in North America so if you
had<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.910> guess<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:18.930> CMYK<00:03:19.500> profile

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
had to guess as to what CMYK profile

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.750 
had to guess as to what CMYK profile
would<00:03:20.489> be<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.730> most<00:03:22.040> universal<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> would

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
would be the most universal then I would

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.300 
would be the most universal then I would
choose<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.239> okay

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
choose that okay

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.610 
choose that okay
let's<00:03:26.310> take<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> look<00:03:26.879> at<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.900> differences

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
let's take a look at the differences

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.520 
let's take a look at the differences
between<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.790> different<00:03:30.269> color<00:03:30.540> spaces<00:03:31.079> okay

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
between the different color spaces okay

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.210 
between the different color spaces okay
so<00:03:32.099> again<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.639> Adobe<00:03:33.060> RGB<00:03:33.209> as<00:03:33.780> shown<00:03:34.709> here

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
so again we have Adobe RGB as shown here

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.619 
so again we have Adobe RGB as shown here
we<00:03:35.669> have<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.359> an<00:03:36.829> sRGB<00:03:37.829> profile<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.449> web

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
we have the an sRGB profile and a web

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.180 
we have the an sRGB profile and a web
coated<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.169> mostly<00:03:40.440> i<00:03:40.560> want<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.829> show<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
coated but mostly i want to show you the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.680 
coated but mostly i want to show you the
difference<00:03:41.579> between<00:03:41.669> a<00:03:43.639> CMYK<00:03:44.639> profile<00:03:45.359> which

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
difference between a CMYK profile which

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.930 
difference between a CMYK profile which
is<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> smaller<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.949> inside<00:03:47.280> versus

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
is the smaller one on the inside versus

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.050 
is the smaller one on the inside versus
an<00:03:48.409> RGB<00:03:49.409> profile<00:03:49.829> on<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.010> outside<00:03:50.340> one<00:03:50.879> of<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
an RGB profile on the outside one of the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.000 
an RGB profile on the outside one of the
biggest<00:03:51.449> challenges<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.349> printing<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.859> we

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
biggest challenges in printing is we

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.159 
biggest challenges in printing is we
lose<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.729> significant<00:03:54.659> amount<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.989> information

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
lose a significant amount of information

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.349 
lose a significant amount of information
when<00:03:55.769> we<00:03:55.919> convert<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.699> CMYK<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:59.010> an

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
when we convert to CMYK that is an

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.000 
when we convert to CMYK that is an
inevitable<00:04:00.359> reality<00:04:01.049> there's<00:04:01.590> no<00:04:01.739> way<00:04:01.859> around

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
inevitable reality there's no way around

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.089 
inevitable reality there's no way around
it<00:04:02.519> it's<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.599> reality<00:04:04.019> we<00:04:04.290> can't<00:04:04.799> get<00:04:05.010> away

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
it it's just a reality we can't get away

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.589 
it it's just a reality we can't get away
from<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.579> fact<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:05.909> when<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.209> convert<00:04:06.419> from

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
from the fact that when you convert from

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.409 
from the fact that when you convert from
a<00:04:07.049> vibrant<00:04:07.739> color<00:04:07.979> image<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.519> Adobe<00:04:08.609> RGB<00:04:09.000> to

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
a vibrant color image in Adobe RGB to

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.199 
a vibrant color image in Adobe RGB to
CMYK<00:04:09.449> you're<00:04:10.139> gonna<00:04:10.290> have<00:04:10.409> a<00:04:10.440> color<00:04:10.650> loss

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
CMYK you're gonna have a color loss

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.280 
CMYK you're gonna have a color loss
hopefully<00:04:12.209> when<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.629> do<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.109> conversion

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
hopefully when you do do that conversion

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.250 
hopefully when you do do that conversion
there's<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.400> be<00:04:14.519> an<00:04:15.000> accurate<00:04:15.629> profile

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
there's going to be an accurate profile

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.500 
there's going to be an accurate profile
describing<00:04:16.859> both<00:04:17.010> situations<00:04:17.699> so<00:04:18.329> there's

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
describing both situations so there's

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.080 
describing both situations so there's
two<00:04:18.690> ways<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.900> can<00:04:19.139> convert<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.829> image<00:04:20.820> in

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
two ways you can convert a image in

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.670 
two ways you can convert a image in
Photoshop<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:22.049> CMYK

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
Photoshop to CMYK

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.640 
Photoshop to CMYK
there's<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.039> bad<00:04:23.310> way<00:04:23.550> which<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.360> mode<00:04:24.630> CMYK<00:04:25.289> I

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
there's a bad way which is mode CMYK I

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.750 
there's a bad way which is mode CMYK I
call<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.039> blind

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
call that a blind

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.300 
call that a blind
conversion<00:04:27.500> basically<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.950> taking

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
conversion basically it's just taking

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.460 
conversion basically it's just taking
whatever<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.090> set<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:30.630> color<00:04:30.990> settings

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
whatever you have set in color settings

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.500 
whatever you have set in color settings
and<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.490> case<00:04:32.730> it's<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.060> us<00:04:33.300> web<00:04:33.480> coated

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
and in this case it's the us web coated

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.380 
and in this case it's the us web coated
and<00:04:34.050> using<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> rendering<00:04:35.700> intent<00:04:36.030> relative

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
and using the rendering intent relative

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.580 
and using the rendering intent relative
colorimetric<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.140> it's<00:04:37.260> going<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.440> make<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
colorimetric and it's going to make a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.380 
colorimetric and it's going to make a
conversion<00:04:38.040> so<00:04:38.310> that's<00:04:38.460> one<00:04:38.790> way<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.030> do<00:04:39.270> it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
conversion so that's one way to do it

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.140 
conversion so that's one way to do it
the<00:04:39.930> other<00:04:39.960> way<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.950> use<00:04:40.980> convert<00:04:41.940> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
the other way is to use convert to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.750 
the other way is to use convert to
profile<00:04:42.600> now<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.440> prefer<00:04:43.830> convert<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.430> profile

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
profile now I prefer convert to profile

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.450 
profile now I prefer convert to profile
because<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.210> allows<00:04:45.540> me<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:46.040> view<00:04:47.040> what's

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
because it allows me to view what's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.850 
because it allows me to view what's
happening<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.690> conversion<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.440> see

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
happening in the conversion and see

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.580 
happening in the conversion and see
what's<00:04:50.220> gonna<00:04:50.400> happen<00:04:50.490> on<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> on<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.750> open<00:04:52.050> so

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
what's gonna happen on it on the open so

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.530 
what's gonna happen on it on the open so
you<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.040> ability<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> choose<00:04:53.940> your

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
you have the ability to choose your

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.280 
you have the ability to choose your
destination<00:04:55.640> profile<00:04:56.810> give<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.990> ability<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
destination profile give the ability to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.220 
destination profile give the ability to
do<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> little<00:04:59.220> preview<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.570> see<00:05:00.780> what's<00:05:01.050> going

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
do a little preview and see what's going

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.200 
do a little preview and see what's going
to<00:05:01.290> happen<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.890> your<00:05:01.980> images<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.970> have<00:05:03.090> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
to happen to your images you have the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.790 
to happen to your images you have the
ability<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.570> toggle<00:05:03.900> through<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.380> couple<00:05:04.590> of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
ability to toggle through a couple of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.620 
ability to toggle through a couple of
different<00:05:05.220> rendering<00:05:05.820> intents<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.390> see<00:05:06.540> if

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
different rendering intents to see if

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.560 
different rendering intents to see if
one<00:05:06.900> is<00:05:07.020> going<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.320> be<00:05:07.470> more<00:05:07.890> useful<00:05:08.390> for<00:05:09.390> what

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
one is going to be more useful for what

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.350 
one is going to be more useful for what
you're<00:05:09.720> trying<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:10.050> achieve<00:05:11.030> any<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.180> these

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
you're trying to achieve any of these

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.660 
you're trying to achieve any of these
three<00:05:12.630> are<00:05:12.750> possible<00:05:13.350> if<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.830> get<00:05:14.100> an<00:05:14.280> outcome

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
three are possible if you get an outcome

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.540 
three are possible if you get an outcome
that<00:05:14.700> works<00:05:15.270> better<00:05:15.570> for<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.160> 99%<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.430> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
that works better for you 99% of the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.770 
that works better for you 99% of the
time<00:05:17.700> you're<00:05:17.880> gonna<00:05:17.970> use<00:05:18.330> relative

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
time you're gonna use relative

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.240 
time you're gonna use relative
colorimetric<00:05:18.960> but<00:05:19.560> there<00:05:19.680> are<00:05:19.800> times<00:05:20.010> when

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
colorimetric but there are times when

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.550 
colorimetric but there are times when
you<00:05:20.370> may<00:05:20.520> find<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:21.120> particular<00:05:21.870> image<00:05:22.380> with

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
you may find a particular image with

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.440 
you may find a particular image with
certain<00:05:22.860> blends<00:05:23.130> may<00:05:23.550> do<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> better

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
certain blends may do a better

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.050 
certain blends may do a better
conversion<00:05:24.870> in<00:05:25.320> perceptual<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.400> choose<00:05:26.910> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
conversion in perceptual so choose the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.670 
conversion in perceptual so choose the
one<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.600> see<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:28.050> works<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.410> best<00:05:28.440> for

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
one that you see that works the best for

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.400 
one that you see that works the best for
you<00:05:28.860> again<00:05:29.700> use<00:05:30.030> relative<00:05:30.390> colorimetric<00:05:30.600> most

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
you again use relative colorimetric most

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.560 
you again use relative colorimetric most
of<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.620> time<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.430> want<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.730> choose<00:05:33.030> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
of the time you want to choose the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.800 
of the time you want to choose the
destination<00:05:34.520> profile<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.850> suits<00:05:36.300> where

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
destination profile that suits where

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.890 
destination profile that suits where
you're<00:05:37.050> going<00:05:37.500> again<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.400> may<00:05:38.730> be<00:05:38.790> if<00:05:39.750> you're

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
you're going again that may be if you're

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.630 
you're going again that may be if you're
going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.260> sheetfed<00:05:40.590> coated<00:05:41.220> or<00:05:41.370> if<00:05:41.490> you're

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
going to a sheetfed coated or if you're

and lastly there's one called crackle
and<00:06:03.270> grackle<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.170> a<00:06:04.200> new<00:06:04.590> initiative<00:06:05.010> by<00:06:05.220> the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
and grackle is a new initiative by the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.770 
and grackle is a new initiative by the
Alliance<00:06:06.270> that<00:06:06.810> will<00:06:07.520> best<00:06:08.520> describe<00:06:08.850> a

sheetfed<00:06:10.740> press<00:06:11.370> on<00:06:11.790> a<00:06:11.850> number<00:06:12.540> one<00:06:12.900> stock<00:06:13.380> so

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
sheetfed press on a number one stock so

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.970 
sheetfed press on a number one stock so
it's<00:06:14.130> similar<00:06:14.640> to<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.840> u.s.<00:06:16.140> sheetfed<00:06:16.380> coated

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
it's similar to the u.s. sheetfed coated

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.480 
it's similar to the u.s. sheetfed coated
but<00:06:17.400> it's<00:06:17.550> an<00:06:17.700> I<00:06:17.970> would<00:06:18.120> say<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.330> more<00:06:18.810> accurate

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
but it's an I would say a more accurate

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.650 
but it's an I would say a more accurate
accurate<00:06:20.490> we<00:06:20.790> have<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:20.970> right<00:06:21.090> word<00:06:21.240> for<00:06:21.480> it

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
accurate we have the right word for it

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.320 
accurate we have the right word for it
it's<00:06:22.050> more<00:06:22.530> tailored<00:06:23.010> to<00:06:23.430> anyone<00:06:23.940> who's<00:06:24.120> doing
