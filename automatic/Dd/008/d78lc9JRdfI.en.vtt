00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
can't get the drama of seeing how many

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.390 
can't get the drama of seeing how many
bricks<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.020> there's<00:00:07.350> two<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
bricks it is but there's two in the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.910 
bricks it is but there's two in the
books<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:08.880> far<00:00:08.910> right<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.380> now<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
books so far right so now this is the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.369 
books so far right so now this is the
design<00:00:11.400> load<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:14.719> who<00:00:15.719> god<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
design load I know who god there's not a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.810 
design load I know who god there's not a
it<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.699> keeping<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.539> very<00:00:22.820> steel

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
it really is keeping a very very steel

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:39.020 
it really is keeping a very very steel
rod<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.420> middle<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> mean<00:00:37.760> there's<00:00:38.760> not

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
rod down the middle you mean there's not

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
rod down the middle you mean there's not
a<00:00:39.090> murmur<00:00:39.390> absolute<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.410> kept<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a murmur absolute is kept that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
a murmur absolute is kept that
configuration<00:00:42.379> absolutely<00:00:43.379> rigid<00:00:44.010> leads<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
configuration absolutely rigid leads now

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
configuration absolutely rigid leads now
six<00:00:45.210> bricks<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.140> beyond<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> load<00:00:46.829> at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
six bricks so it's beyond the load at

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
six bricks so it's beyond the load at
which<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.219> should<00:00:47.399> file<00:00:47.700> okay<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.050> you've<00:00:49.200> been

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
which it should file okay so you've been

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
which it should file okay so you've been
so<00:00:49.649> artful<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.399> too<00:00:50.579> strong<00:00:50.850> yeah

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so artful that it's too strong yeah

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
so artful that it's too strong yeah
let's<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.230> strong<00:00:55.010> no<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.190> deforming

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
let's see how strong no that's deforming

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
let's see how strong no that's deforming
bit<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.420> still<00:00:57.570> keeping<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> straight

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
bit but it's still keeping it straight

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
bit but it's still keeping it straight
you're<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> deforming<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you're right it is deforming a bit you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
you're right it is deforming a bit you
see<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.420> got<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.079> curve<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.680> then

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
see it's got a bit of curve there then

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.139 
see it's got a bit of curve there then
it<00:01:01.949> flattens<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.850> you've<00:01:03.000> got

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it flattens out and then you've got

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
it flattens out and then you've got
another<00:01:03.180> curve<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> obviously<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
another curve there so obviously it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
another curve there so obviously it
looks<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:06.030> what's<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
looks as if that's what's going to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.030 
looks as if that's what's going to
happen<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.470> subjected<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
happen that is going to be subjected to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.760 
happen that is going to be subjected to
too<00:01:08.310> much<00:01:08.460> depth<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.420> those<00:01:09.600> pointers

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.370 

these<00:01:15.460> are<00:01:15.729> slender<00:01:16.090> it's<00:01:16.359> true<00:01:16.630> but<00:01:16.840> not<00:01:17.140> too

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
these are slender it's true but not too

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.109 
these are slender it's true but not too
slender<00:01:17.619> obviously<00:01:18.219> they're<00:01:18.369> not<00:01:18.399> as<00:01:18.969> long<00:01:19.060> as

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
slender obviously they're not as long as

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.669 
slender obviously they're not as long as
they<00:01:19.270> stay<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.630> vertical<00:01:19.929> let's<00:01:20.350> see<00:01:20.500> what

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
they stay in the vertical let's see what

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:30.550 
they stay in the vertical let's see what
gives<00:01:20.920> first

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.840 

well<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.859> good<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.039> give<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.219> mighty<00:01:32.520> fine

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
well this is good to give a mighty fine

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:46.719 
well this is good to give a mighty fine
ratio<00:01:33.299> say<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> least

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.630 

great<00:01:47.729> stuff<00:01:48.770> ok<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.830> there's<00:01:50.130> eight<00:01:50.340> bricks

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
great stuff ok so there's eight bricks

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.950 
great stuff ok so there's eight bricks
there<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.150> almost<00:01:51.360> touching<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> floor

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
there and it's almost touching the floor

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
there and it's almost touching the floor
oh<00:01:53.420> alright<00:01:54.470> nope<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.800> another<00:01:56.040> touch<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
oh alright nope got another touch I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
oh alright nope got another touch I
another<00:01:56.940> breath

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
one so that's what I think we're not

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.240 
one so that's what I think we're not
that<00:02:46.550> far<00:02:47.550> sorry<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.840> string<00:02:49.140> broke<00:02:49.350> well<00:02:50.100> I'm

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that far sorry the string broke well I'm

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.740 
that far sorry the string broke well I'm
blessed<00:02:52.550> yeah<00:02:53.550> well<00:02:53.760> okay<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.120> obviously<00:02:54.360> in

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
blessed yeah well okay but obviously in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.210 
blessed yeah well okay but obviously in
the<00:02:54.810> interest<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.170> letting<00:02:55.440> others<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.830> first

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the interest of letting others go first

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.010 
the interest of letting others go first
at<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.550> time<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> end<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.300> could<00:02:57.480> redo<00:02:57.870> it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
at this time at the end we could redo it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.020 
at this time at the end we could redo it
but<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.500> do<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.070> own<00:02:59.250> time<00:02:59.370> by<00:02:59.910> all

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
but if not do it on your own time by all

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.580 
but if not do it on your own time by all
means<00:03:00.240> because<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.840> strong<00:03:01.320> fella

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
means because that's a strong fella

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.880 
means because that's a strong fella
what's<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> ratio<00:03:02.340> even<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> no<00:03:03.650> no<00:03:06.890> no

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
what's the ratio even with that no no no

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.160 
what's the ratio even with that no no no
no<00:03:08.070> we're<00:03:08.280> being<00:03:08.550> fair<00:03:08.790> we're<00:03:08.970> not<00:03:09.140> we're<00:03:10.140> not

part 3 of bridge busting with and as you
can<00:03:29.940> see<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.420> string<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.959> broke

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
can see it's the string that broke

can see it's the string that broke
supporting<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> bricks<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.880> fact<00:03:33.120> the
