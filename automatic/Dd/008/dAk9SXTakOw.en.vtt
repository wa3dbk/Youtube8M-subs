performance<00:00:06.029> tests<00:00:06.480> on<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.560> asus<00:00:07.980> eee<00:00:08.220> pc

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
performance tests on the asus eee pc

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.009 
performance tests on the asus eee pc
1005<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> hav<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.840> i<00:00:12.929> also

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
1005 a and this is the hav and i also

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.700 
1005 a and this is the hav and i also
have<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.410> H<00:00:13.559> ap<00:00:14.480> for<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.630> performance<00:00:16.260> test

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
have the H ap for this performance test

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.200 
have the H ap for this performance test
I<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> stick<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> v-model<00:00:17.850> because

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
I like to stick with the v-model because

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.070 
I like to stick with the v-model because
it<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.990> slower<00:00:19.859> model<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:21.029> did<00:00:21.869> not

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it is the slower model and I did not

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.710 
it is the slower model and I did not
change<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.680> RAM<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.060> did<00:00:24.449> change

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
change the RAM on this this I did change

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.339 
change the RAM on this this I did change
the<00:00:24.779> RAM<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.199> two<00:00:25.380> gigs<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> wanted

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the RAM to two gigs and I kind of wanted

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
the RAM to two gigs and I kind of wanted
to<00:00:28.529> show<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.429> performance<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.179> these<00:00:30.359> little

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to show the performance of these little

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.709 
to show the performance of these little
netbooks<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.500> we'll<00:00:31.679> start<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.719> Windows

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
netbooks so we'll start with a Windows

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.569 
netbooks so we'll start with a Windows
boot<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> time<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:35.280> stop<00:00:35.670> watch<00:00:35.940> tower<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
boot up time it stop watch tower and I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
boot up time it stop watch tower and I
kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.350> hear

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
kind of want to do this because I hear

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
kind of want to do this because I hear
from<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> people<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.989> should

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
from a lot of people that you should

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.500 
from a lot of people that you should
really<00:00:44.090> think<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.690> getting<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> book

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
really think about getting in that book

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
really think about getting in that book
or<00:00:48.559> reconsider<00:00:49.559> getting<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.070> because

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
or reconsider getting that because

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
or reconsider getting that because
they're<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:51.059> slow<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.750> they're<00:00:52.110> really

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
they're really slow and they're really

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.630 
they're really slow and they're really
underpowered<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> be

underpowered and you're not going to be

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
underpowered and you're not going to be
able<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> things

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
run excel or even wat want to watch

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.090 
run excel or even wat want to watch
movies<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.969> wanted<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.409> wanted<00:01:04.559> to

movies on it so I wanted to I wanted to
do<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> test<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> show<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.840> things

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
do this test just to show the things

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.730 
do this test just to show the things
that<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:09.320> watching<00:01:10.320> maybe

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that you can do on it and watching maybe

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
that you can do on it and watching maybe
a<00:01:10.860> high<00:01:11.250> def<00:01:11.520> video<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.540> we'll<00:01:12.869> give

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
a high def video on it so we'll give

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.100 
a high def video on it so we'll give
that<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> try<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.250> we're<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:15.060> 40<00:01:15.570> seconds

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that a try so we're about at 40 seconds

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.850 
that a try so we're about at 40 seconds
got<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> welcome<00:01:17.430> screen<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.860> Windows

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
got the welcome screen on your Windows

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.330 
got the welcome screen on your Windows
going<00:01:21.470> think<00:01:22.470> we're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.920> right

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going think we're going to be right

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
going think we're going to be right
about<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> minute<00:01:24.270> before<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> usable

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
about a minute before we have usable

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:37.980 
about a minute before we have usable
windows<00:01:27.500> tilt<00:01:28.500> us<00:01:28.650> back<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:34.820> let's<00:01:35.820> see

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
windows tilt us back a bit so let's see

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.560 
windows tilt us back a bit so let's see
still<00:01:38.770> gone<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:40.390> wait<00:01:40.600> till<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:40.930> get<00:01:41.439> a<00:01:42.570> self

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
still gone this wait till we get a self

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.539 
still gone this wait till we get a self
connected<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.380> internet<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.950> there<00:01:45.460> we

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
connected on the internet and there we

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.440 
connected on the internet and there we
go<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:45.970> about<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.750> minute<00:01:47.110> 10<00:01:47.320> seconds<00:01:47.799> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
go so about a minute 10 seconds and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.910 
go so about a minute 10 seconds and
let's<00:01:49.450> start<00:01:49.630> loading<00:01:49.930> up<00:01:50.200> some<00:01:50.439> programs

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
let's start loading up some programs

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.760 
let's start loading up some programs
first<00:01:51.399> we'll<00:01:51.670> start<00:01:51.789> off<00:01:52.090> with<00:01:52.619> Marcus<00:01:53.619> off

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
first we'll start off with Marcus off

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.410 
first we'll start off with Marcus off
office<00:01:54.310> will<00:01:54.640> do<00:01:54.789> excel<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.850> got<00:01:58.030> Excel

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
office will do excel so we got Excel

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
office will do excel so we got Excel
open<00:01:58.869> we'll<00:01:59.170> do<00:01:59.320> one<00:01:59.560> note<00:02:03.840> let's<00:02:04.840> do

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
open we'll do one note let's do
