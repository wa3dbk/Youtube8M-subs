00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.560 
bigger than his face and one thing I'm I
noticed<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:31.430> well<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.310> part<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.000> kind<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
noticed as well is the part that kind of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.390 
noticed as well is the part that kind of
connects<00:02:36.020> everything<00:02:36.440> together<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:37.130> very

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
connects everything together is very

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.720 
connects everything together is very
loose<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:38.690> know<00:02:38.810> if<00:02:38.960> that's<00:02:39.230> because

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
loose I don't know if that's because

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.570 
loose I don't know if that's because
figure<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.970> old<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.080> worn<00:02:42.530> away<00:02:42.710> or

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
figure is old and it's just worn away or

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.640 
figure is old and it's just worn away or
the<00:02:44.330> figures<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.470> general

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
the figures just like that in general

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.310 
the figures just like that in general
but<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:46.820> kind<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.150> nuisance<00:02:47.450> effort<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
but it's kind of a nuisance effort to

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.350 
but it's kind of a nuisance effort to
keep<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.830> splinter<00:02:49.310> mode<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.790> love

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
keep this in the splinter mode I love

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.910 
keep this in the splinter mode I love

Splinter and as you noticed the the body

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.280 
Splinter and as you noticed the the body
stays<00:06:05.470> intact<00:06:05.890> more<00:06:06.310> when<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.300> transform<00:06:07.960> him

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
stays intact more when you transform him

there's no knee art expedition there so
due<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.200> transformation<00:06:35.830> of<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.940> figure

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
due to the transformation of the figure

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.030 
due to the transformation of the figure
the<00:06:37.590> articulation<00:06:38.590> is<00:06:40.710> there's<00:06:41.710> not<00:06:41.830> much

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040

articulation<00:06:42.370> there<00:06:42.880> at<00:06:43.030> all<00:06:43.590> it's<00:06:44.590> very

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
articulation there at all it's very

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.730 
articulation there at all it's very
limited<00:06:45.630> but<00:06:46.630> I<00:06:46.660> do<00:06:46.900> like<00:06:47.260> this<00:06:47.380> figure

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
limited but I do like this figure

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.280 
limited but I do like this figure
because<00:06:48.130> of<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.730> nostalgia<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.390> it<00:06:49.630> and<00:06:49.900> it's

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
because of the nostalgia of it and it's

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.360 
because of the nostalgia of it and it's
just<00:06:50.350> fun

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
just fun

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.360 
just fun
forming<00:06:51.790> him<00:06:52.000> it's<00:06:52.270> fast<00:06:52.600> it's<00:06:52.810> quick<00:06:53.370> it's

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
forming him it's fast it's quick it's

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.930 
forming him it's fast it's quick it's
not<00:06:54.520> perfect<00:06:55.090> I<00:06:55.419> would<00:06:55.870> properly<00:06:56.440> give<00:06:56.860> it<00:06:57.040> so

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
not perfect I would properly give it so

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.210 
not perfect I would properly give it so
when<00:06:58.479> I<00:06:58.510> would<00:06:58.720> take<00:06:59.080> away<00:06:59.260> one<00:07:01.800> one<00:07:02.800> finger

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
when I would take away one one finger

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.320 
when I would take away one one finger
because<00:07:03.580> you<00:07:03.760> can't<00:07:03.940> even<00:07:04.060> stand<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:06.550> body

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
because you can't even stand the body

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.310 
because you can't even stand the body
portions<00:07:07.990> for<00:07:08.530> Yoshii<00:07:08.830> is<00:07:09.250> ridiculous<00:07:10.320> but

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
portions for Yoshii is ridiculous but

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.629 
portions for Yoshii is ridiculous but
can't<00:07:11.650> really<00:07:12.010> blame<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:14.770> toy<00:07:14.949> company<00:07:15.370> that

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 
can't really blame the toy company that

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.030 
can't really blame the toy company that
much<00:07:15.880> because<00:07:16.240> it's<00:07:17.020> tuned<00:07:17.320> one<00:07:17.590> figure

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.040 
much because it's tuned one figure

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.659 
much because it's tuned one figure
something<00:07:18.910> is<00:07:19.000> gonna<00:07:19.180> be<00:07:19.330> off<00:07:19.919> but<00:07:20.919> I'll<00:07:21.490> give
