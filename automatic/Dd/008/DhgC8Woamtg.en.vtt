00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.080 
future you can only do pages like to
usually<00:02:32.180> at<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> pace<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.110> twice<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:34.580> every

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
usually at a pace of twice on every

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.860 
usually at a pace of twice on every
every<00:02:35.780> time<00:02:35.959> he<00:02:36.140> has<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> two-day<00:02:36.680> weekend<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
every time he has a two-day weekend so I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.580 
every time he has a two-day weekend so I
extrapolating<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:41.989> like<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.410> average

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
extrapolating out like the average

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.590 
extrapolating out like the average
length<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.220> our<00:02:43.370> arcs<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.209> would<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.569> would

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
length of our arcs it would it would

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.420 
length of our arcs it would it would
take<00:02:44.810> forever<00:02:44.959> basically<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.340> don't

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
take forever basically and we don't

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.180 
take forever basically and we don't
really<00:02:46.730> want<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:47.000> tied<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:48.080> txn<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.100> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
really want to be tied to a txn to the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.289 
really want to be tied to a txn to the
same<00:02:49.370> story<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.450> next<00:02:50.660> 30<00:02:50.870> years<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.610> we

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
same story for the next 30 years so we

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.110 
same story for the next 30 years so we
came<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> decision<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.549> putting<00:02:55.880> it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
came to the decision of just putting it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.089 
came to the decision of just putting it
down<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.660> rest<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.319> wasn't<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:57.920> going

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
down to rest and it wasn't really going

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.830 
down to rest and it wasn't really going
anywhere<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.420> started<00:02:59.840> another<00:03:00.170> more<00:03:00.799> um

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
anywhere and we started another more um

chapter we haven't pretty good or not
has<00:03:55.430> been<00:03:55.609> respecting<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.209> for<00:03:56.600> now<00:03:56.780> because

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
has been respecting that for now because

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.289 
has been respecting that for now because
we're<00:03:57.200> kind<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.530> setting<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.459> pace<00:03:58.850> but<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
we're kind of setting the pace but the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.539 
we're kind of setting the pace but the
idea<00:03:59.630> was<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.989> have<00:04:00.019> some<00:04:00.470> form<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.799> comic<00:04:01.310> that

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
idea was to have some form of comic that

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.120 
idea was to have some form of comic that
wasn't<00:04:02.480> super<00:04:02.900> terrible<00:04:03.260> right<00:04:03.590> at<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.859> start

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
wasn't super terrible right at the start

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.129 
wasn't super terrible right at the start
if<00:04:04.400> knots<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.239> I'm<00:04:05.389> saying<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> first

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
if knots that I'm saying the first

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.770 
if knots that I'm saying the first
chapter<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:07.730> great<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.389> we've<00:04:08.630> been

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
chapter is that great but we've been

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.710 
chapter is that great but we've been
improving<00:04:09.139> pretty<00:04:09.620> fast<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.519> think<00:04:10.819> yeah<00:04:11.359> and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
improving pretty fast I think yeah and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.979 
improving pretty fast I think yeah and
it's<00:04:12.170> in<00:04:12.470> general<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:13.010> lot<00:04:13.190> easier<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.760> follow

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
it's in general a lot easier to follow

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.979 
it's in general a lot easier to follow
uh<00:04:14.989> it's<00:04:15.709> not<00:04:15.980> as<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:17.030> know<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.419> pure

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
uh it's not as you know just pure

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.390 
uh it's not as you know just pure
nonsense<00:04:18.260> II<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.669> um<00:04:20.769> no<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.039> it's

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
nonsense II and um no I think it's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.970 
nonsense II and um no I think it's
getting<00:04:22.789> all<00:04:23.390> right<00:04:23.659> yeah<00:04:24.380> yeah

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
getting all right yeah yeah

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.300 
getting all right yeah yeah
and<00:04:25.630> overall<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.900> art<00:04:27.080> is<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> lot<00:04:27.530> clearer<00:04:27.860> and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
and overall the art is a lot clearer and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.840 
and overall the art is a lot clearer and
and<00:04:29.440> hopefully<00:04:30.440> hopefully<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.370> story<00:04:31.670> will

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
and hopefully hopefully the story will

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.160 
and hopefully hopefully the story will
be<00:04:31.880> easier<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.330> follow<00:04:32.540> since<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.020> all

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
be easier to follow since it's all

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.750 
be easier to follow since it's all
self-contained<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.220> won't<00:04:34.370> need<00:04:34.550> to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
self-contained and you won't need to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.880 
self-contained and you won't need to
start<00:04:35.570> from<00:04:35.780> any<00:04:36.350> particular<00:04:37.420> place<00:04:38.770> also<00:04:39.770> the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
start from any particular place also the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.530 
start from any particular place also the
release<00:04:40.190> schedule<00:04:40.580> makes<00:04:40.790> no<00:04:41.000> sense<00:04:41.300> because

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
release schedule makes no sense because

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.870 
release schedule makes no sense because
we<00:04:41.810> basically<00:04:41.990> put<00:04:42.620> them<00:04:43.160> up<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.640> one

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
we basically put them up in like one

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.110 
we basically put them up in like one
chapter<00:04:44.360> bunch<00:04:44.690> whenever<00:04:45.140> it's<00:04:45.350> done<00:04:45.560> yeah<00:04:46.220> um

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
chapter bunch whenever it's done yeah um

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.650 
chapter bunch whenever it's done yeah um
I<00:04:48.280> don't<00:04:49.280> know<00:04:49.430> maybe<00:04:49.640> when<00:04:49.940> we<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.210> chapter

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
I don't know maybe when we do a chapter

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.360 
I don't know maybe when we do a chapter
I<00:04:50.690> should<00:04:50.960> just<00:04:51.170> put<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> video<00:04:51.620> say<00:04:51.950> hey<00:04:52.130> yo

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
I should just put a video say hey yo

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.940 
I should just put a video say hey yo
it's<00:04:52.700> done<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:53.810> channel<00:04:54.320> if<00:04:54.440> they<00:04:54.620> come<00:04:54.830> out

it's done this channel if they come out

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.560 
it's done this channel if they come out
seldom<00:04:55.460> enough<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:55.970> don't<00:04:56.240> think<00:04:56.450> it

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
seldom enough that I don't think it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.500 
seldom enough that I don't think it
would<00:04:56.660> be<00:04:56.810> too<00:04:57.020> bothersome<00:04:57.640> yeah<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:59.390> could

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
would be too bothersome yeah you could

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.480 
would be too bothersome yeah you could
