00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
actually look like what the enchantment

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.319 
actually look like what the enchantment
is<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.769> usually<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.219> Minecraft<00:00:32.700> every

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
is because usually with Minecraft every

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.639 
is because usually with Minecraft every
enchantment<00:00:33.809> looks<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.290> no<00:00:34.559> matter

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
enchantment looks the same no matter

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
enchantment looks the same no matter
what<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.670> bluish

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
what it is it just has like a bluish

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.080 
what it is it just has like a bluish
glow<00:00:36.320> but<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.500> mod<00:00:37.710> changes<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
glow but this mod changes it so that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
glow but this mod changes it so that
each<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> separate<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.250> look

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
each one has a separate look so we look

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
each one has a separate look so we look
at<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> swords<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.860> we'll<00:00:43.860> go<00:00:44.010> there

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
at the swords first and we'll go there

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
at the swords first and we'll go there
and<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> normal<00:00:45.149> iron<00:00:45.570> sword

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and that's what a normal iron sword

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
and that's what a normal iron sword
looks<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.140> I've<00:00:46.649> chosen<00:00:46.829> int<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
looks like I've chosen int do all of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.130 
looks like I've chosen int do all of
these<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.270> i<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
these because i think that the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
these because i think that the
enchantment<00:00:49.649> looks<00:00:49.829> better<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.399> iron<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
enchantment looks better on iron it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
enchantment looks better on iron it
shows<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.750> better<00:00:51.930> than<00:00:52.199> diamonds<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
shows it up better than diamonds and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.819 
shows it up better than diamonds and
everything<00:00:54.000> else<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.480> yeah<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
everything else and yeah so this is a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
everything else and yeah so this is a
normal<00:00:56.010> iron<00:00:56.309> sword<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> would

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
normal iron sword and then it would

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
normal iron sword and then it would
scroll<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> left<00:00:58.440> we're<00:00:59.280> left<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
really really cool as you can see it is
a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.240> better<00:01:39.509> than<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.140> having<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> normal

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a lot better than just having the normal

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
a lot better than just having the normal
minecraft<00:01:41.009> globe<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
minecraft globe and it's like it's not a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
minecraft globe and it's like it's not a
massive<00:01:43.530> change<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> game<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
massive change to the game it's just a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.440 
massive change to the game it's just a
really<00:01:45.570> cool<00:01:45.869> aesthetic<00:01:46.079> change<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:48.299> not

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
really cool aesthetic change so I'm not

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.520 
really cool aesthetic change so I'm not
going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> show<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> now

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
going to show you that you like that now

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
going to show you that you like that now
go<00:01:49.710> we've<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.189> knocked<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
go we've got knocked back which is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
go we've got knocked back which is
similar<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.159> sharpness<00:01:53.159> i<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.610> but

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
similar to sharpness i think but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
similar to sharpness i think but
sharpness<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.899> i<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.409> charlotte<00:01:55.770> is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
sharpness there i think charlotte is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
sharpness there i think charlotte is
more<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> purpley<00:01:56.729> glow<00:01:57.000> they're<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.570> back

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
more of a purpley glow they're not back

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.929
