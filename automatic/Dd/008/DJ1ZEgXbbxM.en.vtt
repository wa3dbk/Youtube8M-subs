00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 the voices so much better then guys 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.380
 what does one have as an ingredient for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 our moussaka so you go price of 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.040
 fresh vegetables and that's cool garlic 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 of onion fake eggplant necessarily 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.450
 the star vegetable of the recipe and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.610
 nice little tomatoes from the meat of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 beef with olive oil very well the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.340
 bechamel ready made and bulgur 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 then turmeric 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 we will have paprika herbs 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.170
 provence we will have basil here from 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.490
 thyme and well this time you classic 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.970
 so let's start with the eggplant 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 you cut the base and then we go 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.869
 peel just one sale in two 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.090
 so then we go the cutouts and so 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.060
 you're trying to make slices to these 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.290
 movies I 'm going but already m the first 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.340
 slices of moussaka so that's the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 little trick really he's going to you 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 save time you put a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 little water in a deep plate 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 like that a little trickle of olive oil 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 you cover with food film 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.820
 and went 5 minutes in the microwave oven 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 and aubergines will be ready we will 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 take care of the village is what you can me 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250
 boil a pan of water on 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.500
 will put a little salt in the water 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.610
 you tell me it's here it's to kill 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 just the equivalent of a spoon to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.829
 oil soup 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 we will bring it to a boil and then 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.510
 we will add the Corsican goal so in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.190
 general 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.960
 advocates about 60 grams per 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.240
 nobody from the moment the last 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.350
 it takes about ten minutes 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.350
 then we see the drops and then see 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.760
 fit into the recipe then it will be 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.380
 good it's still a bit crunchy 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.690
 my nickel is perfect then for the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
 following the events we will do the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.780
 small onions and tomato types in 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.430
 very fine dice actually more pieces 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.740
 will be small pleased me it will be fast to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.060
 cook and then to the eggplants when 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.930
 they are cooked 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.520
 they must be soft and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.140
 transparent so that's good it's 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.190
 to say that of which are good for 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.420
 that our moussaka she is really 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.620
 a lot of common booth do that we 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.440
 will go back in olive oil 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.210
 onions with garlic is what we're going 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.170
 to do is come back to him on 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.570
 squeeze the pan 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.040
 directly jack what can we do if 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.750
 you want to add halal meat 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.250
 minced meat and with your wallemme statue 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.210
 was there when we're just a little 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 little olive oil 1 because your 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.500
 onions example on b a little clip of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 just now we will add the spices 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.380
 we will put a little more paprika 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.970
 so maybe turmeric is very 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.220
 pretty so it brings a pretty color 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.670
 especially intense and this is what is stimulating 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 appetite 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.050
 we will put a little faith in them 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.770
 Basil herbs add to them 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.090
 tomatoes another meat mixture of 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.520
 the east continue to mix change of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.410
 name and allowed them do max yeah 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.120
 leave the fire on the mac that will seize 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.700
 your meat is still a little bit of 10 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.129
 kg must be there so we wait until 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.989
 that everything evaporates there again and again 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.190
 3 minutes 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.030
 if you want you can start at 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.400
 preheat the oven so we have a 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530
 power lost time doing it 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.420
 since concretely everything is pre 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.580
 actually cooked in our moussa because we 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.019
 just go au gratin layer was shaman 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.950
 waiting for us to join 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.220
 So it's the idea to make 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.599
 layers 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.260
 yeah so if you want we can 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.489
 start with a little popcorn 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.440
 then I think we can put the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.090
 meat on it but frankly it smells 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.500
 super good actually this dish as it is 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.459
 would already be eating since everything is cooked 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.989
 she has just been a pretty color 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.150
 it's with spices all that so at 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.459
 you do not hesitate to put 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.709
 fresh herbs chopped parsley why 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.700
 not fresh thyme in terms of 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.260
 tracks but you are really what you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.640
 like if you like spicy you can 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.959
 add a little bit of harissa by 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.459
 example hockey and now we're going 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.860
 so put a layer of the inn and 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.280
 since you bought a sauce mac 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.280
 Bechamel 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.209
 we can already put a little layer 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.220
 like that it will make us a full 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.810
 really good fluffy you hesitate 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.459
 not if you reside bulgur at home 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.110
 then to this recipe you keep it 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.790
 cool and you can use it as 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.039
 for a tabbouleh simply with 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.500
 Here diced cucumbers two 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.600
 tomatoes a little bit of requests 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.019
 fresh a drizzle of olive oil salt 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.289
 pepper 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.850
 anyway it feels really good 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.590
 moussaka again there is no 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.419
 bulgur in normally in the dish 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.250
 original but here we wanted a version 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.410
 a little richer the idea is really 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.690
 to have a complete dish with the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.260
 protein meat the starchy foods the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.389
 small vegetables 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.340
 the total and so let's go for 15 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.660
 minutes of cooking at 200 degrees in the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.240
 upper part of the oven just for gratin 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.310
 above attention caution 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.110
 every day we look at this moussaka 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.500

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.970
 month of the blow we recover after the 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.590

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.360
 no but you did not find this 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.460
