going to wet this down I'm just gonna

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.729 
going to wet this down I'm just gonna
let<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.489> sit<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> second<00:02:26.569> then<00:02:27.379> we<00:02:27.470> use<00:02:27.620> my

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
let that sit for a second then we use my

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.649 
let that sit for a second then we use my
heat<00:02:27.980> tool<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.370> move<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.549> colors<00:02:29.000> around<00:02:29.269> get

heat tool to move the colors around get

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.720 
heat tool to move the colors around get
it<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.900> dry<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> little<00:02:30.409> faster<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.519> some

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
it to dry a little faster get some

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.040 
it to dry a little faster get some
movement<00:02:31.909> in<00:02:32.299> there

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.830 

and<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.800> water<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.340> obviously<00:02:38.210> wetting<00:02:38.660> that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and the water is obviously wetting that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.760 
and the water is obviously wetting that
masking<00:02:39.290> tape<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.850> some<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.090> water

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
masking tape and some of that water

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.320 
masking tape and some of that water
watercolor<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.010> probably<00:02:43.580> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.120> leak

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
watercolor is probably going to leak

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.050 
watercolor is probably going to leak
underneath<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.320> that's<00:02:46.250> okay<00:02:46.580> because<00:02:46.730> this

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
underneath and that's okay because this

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.750 
underneath and that's okay because this
water<00:02:47.270> coloring<00:02:47.870> trend<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.130> we're<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.490> now

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
water coloring trend that we're in now

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:06.920 
water coloring trend that we're in now
is<00:02:50.830> not<00:02:51.830> super<00:02:52.430> precise<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.180> perfect

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:22.960 

I<00:03:07.019> love<00:03:07.680> what's<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.310> right<00:03:08.579> here

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.580 

we're<00:03:23.420> gonna<00:03:23.510> heat<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.840> on<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.080> other<00:03:24.200> side<00:03:24.470> to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
we're gonna heat it on the other side to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.929 
we're gonna heat it on the other side to
help<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.860> flatten<00:03:25.220> out<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> little<00:03:25.520> bit

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.059 

now<00:03:33.939> we<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.299> remove<00:03:34.659> this<00:03:35.170> mask<00:03:36.959> wow<00:03:38.069> I

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
now we can remove this mask wow I

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.179 
now we can remove this mask wow I
actually<00:03:39.670> thought<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.659> ink<00:03:41.500> was<00:03:41.709> gonna<00:03:41.859> leak

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
actually thought the ink was gonna leak

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.610 
actually thought the ink was gonna leak
underneath<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:43.000> butterfly<00:03:43.480> mask<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.290> lot

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
underneath that butterfly mask a lot

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.170 
underneath that butterfly mask a lot
more<00:03:44.890> than<00:03:45.069> it<00:03:45.189> did<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.519> actually<00:03:45.640> didn't<00:03:46.030> leak

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
more than it did it actually didn't leak

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.140 
more than it did it actually didn't leak
at<00:03:46.329> all<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:47.049> guess<00:03:47.230> some<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.980> mean<00:03:48.970> I've<00:03:49.120> done

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
at all so I guess some I mean I've done

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.720 
at all so I guess some I mean I've done
techniques<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.260> before<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
techniques like this before and then the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.119 
techniques like this before and then the
ink<00:03:52.180> has<00:03:52.420> leaked<00:03:52.689> under<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.170> quite<00:03:53.409> a<00:03:53.439> bit<00:03:53.530> that

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
ink has leaked under it quite a bit that

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.860 
ink has leaked under it quite a bit that
press<00:03:54.370> down<00:03:54.579> pretty<00:03:54.849> hard<00:03:55.030> before<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.480> did<00:03:55.689> this

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
press down pretty hard before I did this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.990 
press down pretty hard before I did this
so<00:03:56.109> I<00:03:56.140> think<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:56.739> helped<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.280> cut<00:03:57.579> this<00:03:57.730> down<00:03:57.939> a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
so I think that helped I cut this down a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.069 
so I think that helped I cut this down a
little<00:03:58.209> bit<00:03:58.359> so<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.720> three<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:58.989> three

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
little bit so it's three and three

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.080 
little bit so it's three and three
quarters<00:03:59.560> by<00:03:59.739> five<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.370> then<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> four

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
quarters by five and then I have a four

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.179 
quarters by five and then I have a four
by<00:04:01.299> five<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.689> quarter<00:04:01.840> inch<00:04:01.989> mat<00:04:02.409> and<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:03.010> was

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
by five and a quarter inch mat and I was

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.059 
by five and a quarter inch mat and I was
going<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.790> add<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.329> little<00:04:04.389> flag<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
going to add this little flag and I

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.110 
going to add this little flag and I
think<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.459> fine

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
think it's fine

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.270 
think it's fine
but<00:04:07.420> um<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:08.439> kind<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.799> covering<00:04:09.099> up<00:04:09.189> the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
but um it's kind of covering up the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.390 
but um it's kind of covering up the
butterfly<00:04:09.639> and<00:04:09.879> I<00:04:10.150> don't<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.599> don't<00:04:10.959> love<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.769> so

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
butterfly and I don't I don't love it so

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.729 
butterfly and I don't I don't love it so
I<00:04:12.970> am<00:04:13.299> going<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.659> do<00:04:13.930> something<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:14.590> don't

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739
