thing I had the glass block anyway so
perfect<00:03:48.319> so<00:03:48.470> when<00:03:49.010> you're<00:03:49.160> making<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.669> I

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
perfect so when you're making this I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.199 
perfect so when you're making this I
will<00:03:50.450> suggest<00:03:50.660> as<00:03:50.989> well<00:03:51.700> you're<00:03:52.700> gonna<00:03:52.910> want

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
will suggest as well you're gonna want

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.809 
will suggest as well you're gonna want
to<00:03:53.299> make<00:03:53.359> either<00:03:54.079> make<00:03:54.859> these<00:03:55.040> stone<00:03:55.459> or

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
to make either make these stone or

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.909 
to make either make these stone or
carpet<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:56.359> if<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:57.109> leave<00:03:57.319> these<00:03:57.470> dirt<00:03:57.799> as

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
carpet but if you leave these dirt as

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.770 
carpet but if you leave these dirt as
well<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.310> can<00:03:58.340> grow<00:03:58.700> there<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.359> do<00:03:59.599> this

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
well they can grow there so just do this

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.710 
well they can grow there so just do this
do<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.069> now<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.220> know<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.849> has<00:04:02.359> nowhere

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
do this and now you know it has nowhere

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.869 
do this and now you know it has nowhere
to<00:04:02.930> grow<00:04:03.169> but<00:04:03.560> there<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.400> not<00:04:04.639> all

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
to grow but there and this is not all

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.849 
to grow but there and this is not all
block<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.690> an<00:04:05.840> entity<00:04:06.169> that<00:04:06.470> sits<00:04:06.709> on<00:04:06.799> the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
block this is an entity that sits on the

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.430 
block this is an entity that sits on the
block<00:04:07.129> that<00:04:08.030> said<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:08.720> only<00:04:08.900> place<00:04:09.230> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
block that said the only place the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.800 
block that said the only place the
mellah<00:04:09.620> can<00:04:09.889> grow<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.280> on<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.970> minecart<00:04:11.690> as

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
mellah can grow is on that minecart as

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.809 
mellah can grow is on that minecart as
soon<00:04:11.959> as<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.199> does<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:13.040> hammers<00:04:13.400> down<00:04:13.609> and

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
soon as it does that hammers down and

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.719 
soon as it does that hammers down and
does<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.239> let's<00:04:14.480> grab<00:04:14.660> some<00:04:14.870> bonemeal<00:04:15.729> it

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
does it so let's grab some bonemeal it

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.089 
does it so let's grab some bonemeal it
takes<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.150> long<00:04:17.329> time<00:04:17.359> like<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.810> said<00:04:17.840> maybe<00:04:18.680> 32

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
takes a long time like I said maybe 32

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.860 
takes a long time like I said maybe 32
ml<00:04:19.400> in<00:04:19.519> every<00:04:19.729> couple<00:04:20.060> hours<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:20.479> again<00:04:20.720> if

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
ml in every couple hours but again if

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.420 
ml in every couple hours but again if
you're<00:04:20.989> looking<00:04:21.019> for<00:04:21.440> something<00:04:21.680> super<00:04:22.190> tiny

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
you're looking for something super tiny

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.240 
you're looking for something super tiny
and<00:04:22.580> small<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.080> gonna<00:04:24.229> be<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:25.010> ticket

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
and small this is gonna be your ticket

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.040 
and small this is gonna be your ticket
so<00:04:25.669> let's<00:04:25.880> just<00:04:26.120> bonemeal<00:04:26.539> this

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
so let's just bonemeal this

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.480 
so let's just bonemeal this
I<00:04:27.110> don't<00:04:27.409> know<00:04:27.500> if<00:04:27.590> it'll<00:04:27.710> happen<00:04:27.919> in<00:04:28.190> front<00:04:28.370> of

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
I don't know if it'll happen in front of

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.240 
I don't know if it'll happen in front of
us<00:04:28.639> but<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.330> there<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.199> go<00:04:30.379> that's<00:04:30.889> pretty

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
us but and there you go that's pretty

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.339 
us but and there you go that's pretty
much<00:04:31.400> as<00:04:31.580> easy<00:04:31.759> as<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.150> gets

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
much as easy as it gets

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.980 
much as easy as it gets
that<00:04:33.949> will<00:04:34.190> bud<00:04:34.430> every<00:04:34.789> time<00:04:35.030> don't<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.629> was

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
that will bud every time don't I was

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.869 
that will bud every time don't I was
already<00:04:36.650> messing<00:04:37.129> with<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.310> few<00:04:37.610> different

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
already messing with a few different

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.360 
already messing with a few different
ways<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:39.080> try<00:04:39.319> to<00:04:39.349> make<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.800> little<00:04:40.069> bigger

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
ways to try to make this a little bigger

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.520 
ways to try to make this a little bigger
but<00:04:40.669> honestly<00:04:41.060> we're<00:04:41.300> looking<00:04:41.599> at<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:42.139> three

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
but honestly we're looking at like three

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.369 
but honestly we're looking at like three
blocks<00:04:42.770> here<00:04:43.039> guys<00:04:43.220> 1<00:04:43.520> 2<00:04:43.849> 3<00:04:44.150> pretty<00:04:44.479> much<00:04:44.750> it's

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
blocks here guys 1 2 3 pretty much it's

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.379 
blocks here guys 1 2 3 pretty much it's
tiny<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.069> first<00:04:46.310> thing<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.669> did<00:04:46.789> was<00:04:47.120> to

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
tiny the first thing that I did was to

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.420 
tiny the first thing that I did was to
try<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.629> expand<00:04:48.139> it<00:04:48.289> was<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.680> add<00:04:48.800> this<00:04:49.129> on<00:04:49.310> the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
try to expand it was to add this on the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.200 
try to expand it was to add this on the
other<00:04:49.550> side<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.150> then<00:04:50.690> make<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:52.210> grass

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
other side and then make this a grass

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.869 
other side and then make this a grass
block<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:54.169> does<00:04:54.500> not<00:04:54.680> work<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.129> will<00:04:55.159> bud<00:04:55.610> it

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
block that does not work it will bud it

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.820 
block that does not work it will bud it
will<00:04:56.060> cap<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.509> will<00:04:56.629> constantly<00:04:56.990> but<00:04:57.590> if<00:04:57.740> you

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
will cap it will constantly but if you

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.709 
will cap it will constantly but if you
do<00:04:57.979> that<00:04:58.159> watch<00:05:00.879> but<00:05:01.879> once<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.360> put<00:05:02.539> this

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
do that watch but once you put this

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.899 
do that watch but once you put this
block<00:05:02.990> up<00:05:03.199> here<00:05:05.050> now<00:05:06.050> it<00:05:06.259> never<00:05:06.530> turns<00:05:06.830> off<00:05:07.099> so

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
block up here now it never turns off so

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.730 
block up here now it never turns off so
therefore<00:05:08.240> this<00:05:08.810> bud<00:05:09.080> will<00:05:09.289> never<00:05:09.500> work

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
therefore this bud will never work

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.839 
therefore this bud will never work
honestly<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.879> think<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.840> still<00:05:12.319> will<00:05:12.590> work<00:05:12.889> if

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
honestly I think it still will work if

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.680 
honestly I think it still will work if
you<00:05:14.180> were<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:15.009> put<00:05:16.009> the<00:05:16.759> cart<00:05:17.090> right<00:05:17.300> here

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
you were to put the cart right here

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.649 
you were to put the cart right here
however<00:05:18.469> you<00:05:18.740> would<00:05:18.860> then<00:05:19.069> have<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.389> melon<00:05:20.389> farm

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
however you would then have a melon farm

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.659 
however you would then have a melon farm
that<00:05:20.840> would<00:05:20.960> just<00:05:21.169> be<00:05:21.349> constantly<00:05:22.099> hammering

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
that would just be constantly hammering

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.600 
that would just be constantly hammering
2<00:05:22.909> of<00:05:23.090> these<00:05:23.270> all<00:05:23.539> day<00:05:24.020> honestly<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:25.219> don't<00:05:25.400> want

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
2 of these all day honestly I don't want
