00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
kind of loose players in the blinds I've

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
kind of loose players in the blinds I've
just<00:00:41.430> been<00:00:41.550> opening<00:00:41.879> pretty<00:00:42.660> much<00:00:42.780> any<00:00:42.989> any<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
think preflop this is a completely fine

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
think preflop this is a completely fine
open<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.520> only<00:00:50.789> thing<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.449> though

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
open here the only thing is this though

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.139 
open here the only thing is this though
i<00:00:51.899> mean<00:00:52.050> i've<00:00:52.260> said<00:00:52.770> before<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:53.399> wide<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> open

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
i mean i've said before how wide I open

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
i mean i've said before how wide I open
usually<00:00:54.510> sort<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> depends<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> toughness

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
usually sort of depends on the toughness

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
usually sort of depends on the toughness
and<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> aggression<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and this the aggression of the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
and this the aggression of the
opponent's<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> blinds<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.730> think

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
opponent's and the blinds and I think

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.310 
opponent's and the blinds and I think
when<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.510> these<00:01:00.629> guys<00:01:00.840> Tess<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> mean

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
we have quite we don't have too many

hands<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.780> these<00:01:03.930> guys<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> what

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
hands on these guys the thing is what

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
hands on these guys the thing is what
you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.729> stats<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> sort<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you know you need stats to sort of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.350 
you know you need stats to sort of
converge<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.670> until<00:01:09.210> they

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
converge but you know until they

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
converge but you know until they
converge<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.280> best

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
converge that's kind of the best

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
converge that's kind of the best
information<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> mean<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
information you have so I mean if you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
information you have so I mean if you
have<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:13.950> ninety<00:01:14.369> two<00:01:14.520> hands<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> guy

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
have you know ninety two hands and a guy

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
have you know ninety two hands and a guy
and<00:01:15.479> he's<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:16.189> 7255<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.610> assume<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and he's you know 7255 just assume that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
and he's you know 7255 just assume that
he's<00:01:18.210> loose<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.110> 91<00:01:19.799> hands

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
he's loose and if you have like 91 hands

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
he's loose and if you have like 91 hands
on<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> guy<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> he's<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.180> 19<00:01:21.450> 12<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.320> mean<00:01:23.100> even

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
on a guy and he's like 19 12 I mean even

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
on a guy and he's like 19 12 I mean even
though<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.640> stats<00:01:23.880> haven't<00:01:24.210> converge<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
though those stats haven't converge it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.390 
though those stats haven't converge it
you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.350> assume<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you can kind of assume that that you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
you can kind of assume that that you
know<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> best<00:01:27.330> information<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
know that's the best information you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.950 
know that's the best information you
have<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> sort<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.520> from<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
have as of now to sort of go from so the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
have as of now to sort of go from so the
thing<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> 410<00:01:31.979> open<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
thing is this what you could vary here

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.980 
thing is this what you could vary here
is<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.439> array<00:01:50.280> size<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.689> button

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is actually the array size on the button

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600 
is actually the array size on the button
so<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> usually<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.310> usually<00:01:53.579> very

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so what I usually do is is usually very

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
so what I usually do is is usually very
smaller<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> button<00:01:54.600> against<00:01:54.810> regulars

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
smaller on the button against regulars

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
smaller on the button against regulars
that<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:56.310> unable<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> flat<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> position

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that are unable to flat out a position

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
that are unable to flat out a position
and<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.439> something<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.890> sort<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.100> keep<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and that's something to sort of keep in

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.240 
and that's something to sort of keep in
mind<00:01:59.840> some<00:02:00.840> regulars<00:02:01.229> especially<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> go

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
mind some regulars especially as you go

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.560 
mind some regulars especially as you go
a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.399> bit<00:02:02.549> higher<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.000> stakes<00:02:03.270> are

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
a little bit higher up in stakes are

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.910 
a little bit higher up in stakes are
going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.810> sort<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> unable<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.649> flat<00:02:04.890> out

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
going to be sort of unable to flat out

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.880 
going to be sort of unable to flat out
of<00:02:05.250> position<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.079> default<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
of position and that's a default for a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.790 
of position and that's a default for a
lot<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.099> regulars<00:02:08.550> today<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> usually<00:02:10.470> they'll

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
lot of regulars today so usually they'll

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160 
lot of regulars today so usually they'll
either<00:02:11.009> three<00:02:11.400> better<00:02:11.610> fold<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:13.050> will

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
either three better fold and that will

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
either three better fold and that will
make<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> smaller

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
make the smaller

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
make the smaller
has<00:02:14.190> achieved<00:02:14.520> two<00:02:14.760> things<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> mentioned

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
has achieved two things and I mentioned

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.040 
has achieved two things and I mentioned
this<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:15.989> video<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:18.180> know<00:02:18.300> first<00:02:18.810> off

this in my video and you know first off

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.830 
this in my video and you know first off
it<00:02:19.739> will<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:22.379> will<00:02:22.440> mean<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it will it will mean that I can get a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.259 
it will it will mean that I can get a
smaller<00:02:25.650> forbidden<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.879> get<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> price

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
smaller forbidden or I can get a price

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.880 
smaller forbidden or I can get a price
that<00:02:27.300> allowed<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.959> call<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.319> position<00:02:28.739> with

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that allowed me to call in position with

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.920 
that allowed me to call in position with
a<00:02:28.920> wide<00:02:29.160> range<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.640> hands<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.420> initial<00:02:30.780> ray

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
a wide range of hands if my initial ray

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.190 
a wide range of hands if my initial ray
size<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.380> smaller<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.019> a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
size is smaller and that is kind of a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.280 
size is smaller and that is kind of a
position<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.170> also

my immediate odds for winning the money

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.180 
my immediate odds for winning the money
outright<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.110> Dead<00:02:40.290> Money<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.620> blinds<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
outright the Dead Money in the blinds is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
outright the Dead Money in the blinds is
a<00:02:41.489> lot<00:02:41.760> higher<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.540> would<00:02:42.780> make<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.379> for

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
a lot higher if I would make it for

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.270 
a lot higher if I would make it for
instance<00:02:44.030> 0.25<00:02:45.030> rather<00:02:45.840> than<00:02:46.080> 0<00:02:46.380> 30<00:02:46.680> however

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
instance 0.25 rather than 0 30 however

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.890 
instance 0.25 rather than 0 30 however
if<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.519> feel<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.910> people<00:02:48.090> are<00:02:48.330> flattering<00:02:48.840> me

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
if I feel that people are flattering me

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.589 
if I feel that people are flattering me
constantly<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.830> position<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.430> think<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.239> 3

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
constantly out of position I think the 3

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.420 
constantly out of position I think the 3
x-ray<00:02:51.870> size<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.410> fine<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.040> want<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
x-ray size is fine because I want to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.770 
x-ray size is fine because I want to
actually<00:02:53.519> play<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.880> part<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.360> guys<00:02:54.540> out<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
actually play a part these guys out of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
actually play a part these guys out of
position<00:02:54.870> even<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.099> know<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.549> wide

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
position even if they know I have a wide

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.059 
position even if they know I have a wide
range<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.269> i<00:02:57.329> think<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.780> open<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.319> fine<00:02:58.530> yeah

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
range but i think the open is fine yeah

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.650 
range but i think the open is fine yeah
to<00:02:59.549> take<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.849> step<00:02:59.880> further<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.540> had

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
to take it a step further if you had

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.330 
to take it a step further if you had
some<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.049> pocket<00:03:01.410> aces<00:03:01.530> would<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.099> like

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
some like pocket aces would you like

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.580 
some like pocket aces would you like
five<00:03:02.610> exit<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> button<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.590> nothing

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
five exit on the button here nothing

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.370 
five exit on the button here nothing
because<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:05.970> against<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:07.079> thing<00:03:07.230> is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
because know if against the thing is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.270 
because know if against the thing is
this<00:03:07.700> my<00:03:08.700> race<00:03:09.180> size<00:03:09.450> has<00:03:10.410> balance<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
this my race size has balance but it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.130 
this my race size has balance but it
only<00:03:11.400> changes<00:03:11.730> depending<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> opponents

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
only changes depending on the opponents

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
only changes depending on the opponents
in<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.230> blind<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.530> let's<00:03:13.709> say<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.829> have<00:03:13.860> one

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
in the blind so let's say I have one

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.390 
in the blind so let's say I have one
huge<00:03:14.459> fish<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.329> sort<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.959> know<00:03:16.400> tough

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
huge fish and one sort of you know tough

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.069 
huge fish and one sort of you know tough
reg<00:03:17.670> I'm<00:03:17.880> going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> always<00:03:18.269> three<00:03:18.660> exit<00:03:18.959> out

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
reg I'm going to always three exit out

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.840 
reg I'm going to always three exit out
if<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> tough<00:03:19.829> rigs<00:03:20.100> I'm<00:03:20.310> always<00:03:20.579> going

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
if I have to tough rigs I'm always going

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.120 
if I have to tough rigs I'm always going
to<00:03:20.940> two-and-a-half<00:03:21.239> exit<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> I'll<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:24.329> know

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
to two-and-a-half exit so I'll you know

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.690 
to two-and-a-half exit so I'll you know
chances<00:03:26.130> are<00:03:26.310> they<00:03:27.299> won't<00:03:27.540> notice<00:03:28.019> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
chances are they won't notice the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.520 
chances are they won't notice the
difference<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:30.209> race<00:03:30.389> sighs<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.930> chances

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
are very small portion of that range

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.940 
are very small portion of that range
right<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.260> rest<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> range

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
right so it's the rest of the range

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.060 
right so it's the rest of the range
that's<00:04:14.190> important<00:04:14.760> right<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:16.470> does<00:04:16.889> that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
that's important right that does that

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.490 
that's important right that does that
make<00:04:17.220> sense<00:04:17.250> yeah<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.079> that<00:04:19.079> does<00:04:19.289> make

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
make sense yeah that that does make

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.070 
make sense yeah that that does make
sense<00:04:19.709> um<00:04:21.320> we<00:04:22.320> flop<00:04:22.800> pretty<00:04:23.729> much<00:04:23.849> nothing<00:04:24.120> and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
sense um we flop pretty much nothing and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.160 
sense um we flop pretty much nothing and
both<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.010> them<00:04:26.220> check<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.789> at<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.510> point<00:04:27.750> I

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
both of them check and at this point I

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.230 
both of them check and at this point I
decided<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.680> it's<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.130> think<00:04:29.670> if<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.090> was<00:04:30.180> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
decided that it's I think if it was just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.550 
decided that it's I think if it was just
heads<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:32.330> feel<00:04:33.330> like<00:04:33.450> if<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.140> bet<00:04:34.350> here

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
heads up I I feel like if I bet here

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.600 
heads up I I feel like if I bet here
which<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.860> do<00:04:35.810> my<00:04:36.810> bed<00:04:37.140> should<00:04:37.560> be<00:04:37.980> perceived<00:04:38.430> as

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
which I do my bed should be perceived as

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.040 
which I do my bed should be perceived as
a<00:04:38.640> lot<00:04:38.850> stronger<00:04:39.240> when<00:04:39.570> I'm<00:04:39.690> betting<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:39.990> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
a lot stronger when I'm betting in a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.780 
a lot stronger when I'm betting in a
tubular<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.860> I'm<00:04:40.980> betting<00:04:41.250> heads<00:04:41.580> up

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
tubular that if I'm betting heads up

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.140 
tubular that if I'm betting heads up
right<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:44.070> definitely<00:04:44.400> perceived<00:04:44.970> as<00:04:45.090> a

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
right it is definitely perceived as a

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.490 
right it is definitely perceived as a
lot<00:04:45.300> stronger<00:04:45.540> when<00:04:45.810> you're<00:04:45.930> betting<00:04:46.170> here<00:04:46.410> in

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
lot stronger when you're betting here in

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.410 
lot stronger when you're betting here in
two<00:04:46.800> into<00:04:47.610> two<00:04:47.640> people<00:04:47.910> but<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.210> thing<00:04:48.390> is

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
two into two people but the thing is

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.480 
two into two people but the thing is
this<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.960> haven't<00:04:49.470> played<00:04:49.560> micros<00:04:50.040> for<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.310> while

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
this I haven't played micros for a while

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.510 
this I haven't played micros for a while
but<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.810> know<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.590> think<00:04:53.070> that<00:04:53.280> when<00:04:53.490> you

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
but you know I I think that when you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.010 
but you know I I think that when you
look<00:04:53.700> at<00:04:53.790> these<00:04:53.940> guys<00:04:54.120> that's<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.570> think<00:04:54.600> sort

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
look at these guys that's I think sort

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.570 
look at these guys that's I think sort
of<00:04:55.680> any<00:04:56.010> Ace<00:04:56.400> or<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.820> sex<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.870> some<00:04:58.320> type<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.860> a

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
of any Ace or a sex of some type is a

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.240 
of any Ace or a sex of some type is a
lot<00:04:59.880> larger<00:05:00.360> part<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> range<00:05:01.290> than<00:05:01.620> King<00:05:01.980> X

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
lot larger part of the range than King X

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.000 
lot larger part of the range than King X
of<00:05:02.520> some<00:05:02.760> time<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.660> like<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.260> board<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:04.590> King

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
of some time so like a board like King

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.200 
of some time so like a board like King
65<00:05:05.760> from<00:05:06.540> me<00:05:06.690> would<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:06.930> exponentially<00:05:07.920> an

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
65 from me would be exponentially an

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.430 
65 from me would be exponentially an
exponentially<00:05:09.210> better<00:05:09.390> seabed<00:05:09.930> in<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.230> spot

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
exponentially better seabed in this spot

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.100 
exponentially better seabed in this spot
and<00:05:10.740> what's<00:05:11.310> more<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.790> that<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:12.090> know<00:05:12.210> just

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
and what's more is that you know just

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.660 
and what's more is that you know just
generalizing<00:05:13.710> here<00:05:13.890> looks<00:05:14.190> like<00:05:14.250> these<00:05:14.460> guys

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
years ago when I started playing I was

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.330 
years ago when I started playing I was
thinking<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.090> myself<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.480> you<00:06:33.660> know<00:06:33.690> people

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
thinking to myself that you know people

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.620 
thinking to myself that you know people
wow<00:06:35.340> they<00:06:35.640> don't<00:06:35.850> know<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.030> value<00:06:36.060> of<00:06:36.420> the

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
wow they don't know the value of the

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.510 
wow they don't know the value of the
back<00:06:36.810> door<00:06:37.050> draw<00:06:37.260> whereas<00:06:37.980> today<00:06:38.190> I'm

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
back door draw whereas today I'm

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.770 
back door draw whereas today I'm
thinking<00:06:38.850> that<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:39.030> know<00:06:39.060> people<00:06:39.150> way

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
thinking that you know people way

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.480 
thinking that you know people way
overestimate<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.650> value<00:06:40.680> of<00:06:41.040> the<00:06:41.160> back

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
overestimate the value of the back

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.309 
overestimate the value of the back
things<00:06:41.970> have<00:06:42.120> shifted<00:06:42.270> quite<00:06:42.720> a<00:06:42.750> bit<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.289> know

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
things have shifted quite a bit you know

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.809 
things have shifted quite a bit you know
when<00:06:43.530> it<00:06:43.620> comes<00:06:43.650> to<00:06:43.860> six<00:06:44.130> max<00:06:44.370> these<00:06:44.610> days

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 
when it comes to six max these days

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.249 
when it comes to six max these days
everybody's<00:06:45.240> sort<00:06:45.449> of<00:06:45.599> using<00:06:45.960> their<00:06:46.080> back

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
everybody's sort of using their back

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.379 
everybody's sort of using their back
door<00:06:46.289> drawers<00:06:46.680> as<00:06:46.889> a<00:06:47.400> justification<00:06:47.849> for

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
door drawers as a justification for

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.200 
door drawers as a justification for
making<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:48.810> know<00:06:48.930> quite<00:06:49.650> spirit<00:06:50.069> plays<00:06:50.280> so<00:06:51.180> I

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
making you know quite spirit plays so I

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.420 
making you know quite spirit plays so I
think<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.569> back<00:06:51.720> door<00:06:51.930> draw<00:06:52.050> is<00:06:52.110> fairly<00:06:52.800> you

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
think the back door draw is fairly you

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.809 
think the back door draw is fairly you
know<00:06:53.460> irrelevant<00:06:54.060> here<00:06:55.190> but<00:06:56.190> I<00:06:56.220> think<00:06:56.580> if

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 
know irrelevant here but I think if

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.520 
know irrelevant here but I think if
there's<00:06:57.240> one<00:06:57.419> Street<00:06:57.750> that's<00:06:57.960> sort<00:06:58.259> of<00:06:58.319> miss

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
there's one Street that's sort of miss

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.920 
there's one Street that's sort of miss
played<00:06:58.770> it's<00:06:58.949> this<00:06:59.099> one<00:06:59.310> where<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.330> think<00:07:00.599> that

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
played it's this one where I think that

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.529 
played it's this one where I think that
continuation<00:07:01.740> bet<00:07:01.949> is<00:07:02.250> kind<00:07:02.639> of<00:07:02.849> you<00:07:03.509> know

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
continuation bet is kind of you know

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.170 
continuation bet is kind of you know
kind<00:07:03.870> of<00:07:03.990> out<00:07:04.139> there<00:07:04.169> okay<00:07:05.069> yeah<00:07:05.789> I'll

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
kind of out there okay yeah I'll

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.480 
kind of out there okay yeah I'll
translate<00:07:06.720> that<00:07:06.960> for<00:07:07.500> much<00:07:07.710> it's<00:07:08.039> hoping<00:07:08.310> for

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
translate that for much it's hoping for

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.040 
translate that for much it's hoping for
me<00:07:08.819> it<00:07:09.120> might<00:07:09.240> not<00:07:09.360> be<00:07:09.419> a<00:07:09.479> terror<00:07:09.750> I<00:07:09.810> mean<00:07:09.960> it's

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
me it might not be a terror I mean it's

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.360 
me it might not be a terror I mean it's
definitely<00:07:10.169> not<00:07:10.410> a<00:07:10.470> terrible<00:07:10.979> play<00:07:11.160> I<00:07:11.190> mean

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
definitely not a terrible play I mean

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.499 
definitely not a terrible play I mean
it's<00:07:11.460> not<00:07:11.550> a<00:07:11.610> you<00:07:12.330> know<00:07:12.449> super<00:07:13.080> minus<00:07:13.410> CV<00:07:13.710> play

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
it's not a you know super minus CV play

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.249 
it's not a you know super minus CV play
absolutely<00:07:15.509> not<00:07:15.630> it<00:07:15.750> might<00:07:15.870> not<00:07:15.960> even<00:07:16.020> be

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
absolutely not it might not even be

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.059 
absolutely not it might not even be
minus<00:07:16.650> CV<00:07:16.949> but<00:07:18.199> probably<00:07:19.199> checking<00:07:19.590> is<00:07:19.860> is

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:20.069 
minus CV but probably checking is is

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:24.349 
minus CV but probably checking is is
more<00:07:20.639> +<00:07:20.909> cv<00:07:21.120> okay<00:07:21.870> I<00:07:21.900> would<00:07:22.169> think
