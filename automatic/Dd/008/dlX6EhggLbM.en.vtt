00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 hi welcome everyone on the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 nien shock nonnies so for this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.779
 first Christmas recipe I propose you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 shortbread cookies with spices and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.430
 salt crystals every step very 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.380
 simple video 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 we start this recipe with butter 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 and the spices to you take a little 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.810
 salad bowl you put butter ointment 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.460
 so I was a little bit too hard 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 I had just come out 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.739
 from the fridge 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.510
 not really thought about taking it out before 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.579
 really for it to be very fluffy 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 so you put the butter you go 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 add the spices so cinnamon 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.690
 cardamom and honey then honey you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.420
 can take honey any simple mail 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 of honey forest thousand fairground flowers what 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.539
 that you have at home and then 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.250
 you start mixing a little bit 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 and you will add the icing sugar 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 so that's kind of lumps 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 drop because I tell you again my 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 butter to me was really too hard 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.799
 so thought about going out before that then 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.740
 you mix up so get one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.090
 kind of dough a little creamy 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 then you will add an egg 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 whole that you have previously beaten 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 so as beaten in omelette you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 add it to mix the preparation 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.430
 a minute and then you go 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 finished so preparing the dough 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.110
 with the flour you add to it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 as you mix and then 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.549
 here you can finish 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.560
 possibly with your little mimines 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.360
 from here you take it out of the salad bowl 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.150
 it's easier so you work 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.799
 the dough but really 30 seconds not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.509
 more sensible not worth it is not a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.880
 bread dough that we do so here you go 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.409
 knead it a little bit 30 seconds and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 then you will take a movie 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.520
 food and you'll put it in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.470
 ball wanting to roll and place you at 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.579
 fridge for about two hours 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 so this is a step that is not 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.479
 obligatory if you are in a hurry 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 do not put in the cool but hey when 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.969
 even better 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.460
 the result is better when we place 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.010
 fresh 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.020
 then there the exit of the fridge the dough goes 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.729
 to be hard enough so you warm her up 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.890
 in your hands you knead it to 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.530
 again a few seconds and then to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 will become again ultra flexible and you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 have more than flour and the plan of 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 work wanted you were going with a 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.239
 rolling pin so no matter the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.180
 shape we did not care wanted talent and the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.560
 coffee moment about 4 5 mm 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.209
 thick it is not necessary that it is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.130
 Too hungry you must not be too 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.780
 thick either so once you 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.520
 get this thickness you go 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.160
 take cookie cutters out of your 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.209
 choice and you're coming so cut off 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.739
 full of forms 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.880
 inside this dough so there 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.489
 obviously we are under the theme of Christmas 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.840
 so here find fir stars 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.209
 snowmen etc 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.670
 and then when you have more room 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.800
 you take the shortbread you go 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.780
 deposit them directly on the 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.820
 hob and then you go 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.800
 pick up the rest of the dough to form 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.930
 a ball and you are it was going to 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.670
 new and we start again the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.910
 tables until there is no more 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 skate so once you've dropped 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.540
 so all the shortbread on the plate of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 oven you bake them at 180 degrees to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.410
 mid height for 10 minutes so 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.269
 following the ovens monitor cooking 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 so it's going pretty fast and in fact there 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.079
 simply need them to be well 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.910
 gold- plated after you can decorate 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.500
 your sand and it's not mandatory either 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.900
 want to taste as it is 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.480
 put in an airtight box and that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 can be kept for several days 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.799
 can continue therefore the decoration in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.380
 making a royal icing so with some 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.019
 lemon icing sugar a few drops 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.790
 lemon or a small lemon juice and 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.710
 with an egg white so we went up in 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.270
 agen 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.280
 for the royal icing so it's fast 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.110
 to make you put icing sugar on 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.090
 lemon on top and then you go 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.370
 so add the egg that was beaten in 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.620
 snow and you mix so up 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.640
 really get a seamless texture 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.230
 smooth and shiny 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.060
 so here is the royal icing is ready 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.620
 wanted to go straight away 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 on the sands and so layered 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.910
 averages so that's it's white 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.950
 well petain so after you go 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.330
 let it dry for a few hours 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.040
 can go further in the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.180
 decoration by putting a few drops 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.400
 for example food coloring 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.070
 to make simple towards 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.930
 yellow stars what you want you 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.690
 can also use so that's it 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.150
 the food powder so here you are 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.130
 put directly over the frosting 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.140
 so there are red yellows 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.780
 there are lots of colors so that makes 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.090
 a nice little iridescent effect and 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.340
 then you can also use if 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.620
 you want to gel pens so 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.600
 such food and there you can 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.640
 draw the outline of fir tree you 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.110
 can make small ones small 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.870
 points of the stars of the hearts end what 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.950
 you go through the head 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.050
 So here are first Christmas recipes 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.060
 finished in any case it's a workshop 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.650
 very nice to do with your children if 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.750
 you buy a little bit of material 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.980
 so gels and dyes I think 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.390
 that they will be happy so for 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.330
 the arrival of christmas is really nice to 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.490
 to do in any case delicious especially the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.500
 discrete little spices and then the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.940
 small salt crystals with small 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.460
 pieces there that crunches under the tooth 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.950
 finally really nice so do not hesitate 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.510
