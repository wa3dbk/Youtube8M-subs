 Do you want this is one of the neighborhoods secrets? 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.850
 the old agent will choose the poles 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.580
 but always stays to the end 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 more important today is a suspense with 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.680
 enough sound and these stories are all 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.390
 and the raul tap in the characters of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.600
 a way that you do not forget where 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.239
 they have striking features he has 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.130
 striking personality does not forget 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.320
 of the characters and you will want 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.890
 discover more and more secrets from them 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.110
 as for example the blog has a secret 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.780
 that speaks that can destroy the family 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.150
 Hence he wants to leave confused 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.799
 Curious, then we 'll see our 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 stories are developing they wanted 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.880
 know what really happened in all 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.310
 they think several ministries and all 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.850
 They are connected as you know it in 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.739
 Last 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.019
 I do not know what I thought I thought it was good 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.570
 very good I do not know if the line again 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.850
 because it 's my type all the secrets but 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.970
 just for the writing of leiria again yes 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.709
 even to improve maybe they never flew 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.840
 It was thus not that he wrote 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 very complex the writing of it simple and 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.730
 objective 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.440
 but she was very good and fluid then the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.450
 people show that they do not need to talk 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.820
 super difficult vocabulary words 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.370
 superliga practice a cool story and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.489
 that has complexity of its 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.820
 fact that house here the planet 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.480
 the drawing is only her source than the title 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.750
 It was very blurred here 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.140
 the source is also very normal because otherwise 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.019
 the most elaborate thing can here mean 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.729
 dead or not yesterday second 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.000
 is a sweetie book has three years and 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:26.940
 few pages or else I went there yellowish 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.330
 that do not tire much in sight and now 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:35.400
 It's okay but it does not have a photo of the weird one but 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.860
 he's like oh super recommend this book 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 we have that it is very good and it also has 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.650
 That thing with clapping and a 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.870
 character it becomes more realistic because 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.729
 is an author who puts things together 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.919
 day-to-day television program on the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.780
 book it rate by raising the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.060
 Facebook button character in one 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.370
 social networks and everything and we can 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.650
 there really is a character he speaks 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.669
 I said that there is damn suspense 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.310
 very good only the final call made the 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.960
 third example and I am I recommend the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.120
 book is very good even a lot that 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.310
 I said that it's bad that in the future it 's 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.020
 Well, it's a bad idea to get in the way of this. 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.090
 but only a little bit in the end that differs 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.280
