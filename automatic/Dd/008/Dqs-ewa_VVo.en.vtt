 5 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.480
 one Sunday he provided me bringing them 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.040
 and this time it's one that calls furniture or 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
 well I say so is me 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.090
 reading peanut if I do not know average yes 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.580
 but well that 's very funny for 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 decorate a house and things like this not this one 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 it is great average but good will 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.290
 we remove texture package and we need 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 the scratch mode I leave them 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.989
 compressed in the download link the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.030
 description of the video also the link 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.710
 of the creator and obvious the creator in the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 description of the video everything is together and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.239
 down and good once unzip no longer 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.700
 have everything and we will look first what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 it's what we're going to put it big problem is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.210
 go see if you are music options 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.920
 which requires the restart then packets 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 of texture and let's look for the place 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 where we have installed or sorry 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 downloaded the texture pack me in this 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.170
 case I have it here and then just what 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 select and ready not now let's 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.570
 install the phone we give you a key 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.030
 cited through administer mode 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.979
 write and then we give in import 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.780
 local storage and we look for the place 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.360
 where we have saved the mode that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 in this case is this pocket fornitura 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 and well it sounds like something perverted 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 trimmings and how formica 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 we can say my mind I know what to talk 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.140
 but we're going to give you play 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.060
 give you new let's create a world nothing 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.860
 more for me to show it to him and good but that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.200
 it appears to them this what is this is 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.440
 to add music as it is added 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.910
 well as you say diagonal sdk or the 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.710
 where you have the music because only 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.210
 put on the road, I do not do anything else 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.950
 that my grace is freeze me 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.200
 minecraft no longer injected of cepedo a 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.850
 little pig but pig a cow is one 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.830
 vaquita won with some vaquita and a 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 pet and a piglet but well let's go 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.240
 come on we go here we go to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.430
 try and way we will try this engine 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.410
 for per board 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.940
 let's see up here let's try 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.590
 this world up here this one clicked 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.210
 kill do not come 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.860
 Well, maybe a place will arrive 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.750
 plane to try this mobile there are many 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.220
 animals and you see that if you decide to be 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.050
 because just so cool is when 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.940
 I do not have serious but not here we are going to 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.740
 try to start when we enter it 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 they realize that this sign appears and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.140
 simply to add all the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 systems do not put diagonal 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think that's the way it is and automatically 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.100
 all the items will appear 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 a board will appear that is like a 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.190
 type in addition and how to explain them is 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.230
 how 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.540
 I have a dinner I do not know what it's called in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 your place but it's to store things for 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 certain types here and what I put is 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.520
 here and this is how to store things not 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.920
 can not be opened I think no no no 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.480
 open but we have a good TV 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.850
 also so if we get bored here in my 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.290
 box with a TV enclosed here then 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.300
 we already have a pinche you take it away now 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.710
 we have a chair the quad chairs 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.630
 when we place it unfortunately 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.790
 It looks like a staircase, but if we 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.980
 we go in third person then we have 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 a pinche girl chair in the hand not the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.800
 we have here in the hand and hence 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.330
 we have what is this that is a table 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.490
 same looks good but when you put it 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.290
 it only looks like a table with your hand and 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.600
 the last thing that would be this that is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.280
 stamped I think they are like stones in 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.230
 the floor but when they put on I do not know why 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.520
 what is left to you like the white stone is 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.520
 here that makes you see 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.100
 here it does not make you see the water is a TV 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.530
 this is a matter I'll finish 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.950
 let's put more know it does not look any more 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.950
 Y 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.629
 and I think that's how it was and see if it appears 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.069
 five others appear but good as they 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.959
 I say this earth is a stone 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.280
 agreement is like the stone 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.569
 invisible I do not remember what it's called 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 that thing that makes you see under the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.050
 earth and if you have a cave to say 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.960
 here 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.360
 so it makes you see here that there is a cave and 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.850
 down things like that but not good does this give you 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.890
 this material and nothing else are all new 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.480
 one two three four five are the five 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.770
 materials that you add but what 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.660
 the truth really matter what 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.760
 it matters is the TV you can put yourself 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.250
 a clicche cloth here and as you see post it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.250
 go cabrona carat we're going to put another 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.530
 tele here because it is not placed there because 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.660
 is placed on TV I do not know but good 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.340
 it replaces the blocks it is medium 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.720
 weird how this is placed but good is 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.240
 a block I hope you like it more than anything 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.830
 to decorate this is a way because 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.690
 there are mod that are cheating and you call him 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.340
 mortar there is no reason and pitfalls are 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.049
 different things and how good I hope them 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.520
 like more than anything for this one for this one and 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.780
 for the little table that the little table also 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.730
 can normally create in minecraft 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.590
 because you only put a fence and 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.480
 you put one of the soul and you can create a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.910
 no table but hey I hope you like it is 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.620
 of mod is great to donate home without 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.110

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.830

 so let's do them to see if what 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.830
 I think I think it's clear to him 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.410
 let's deviate a bit from the subject 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.510

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.760
