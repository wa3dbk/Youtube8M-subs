a little bit about jump-offs to shave
those<00:00:08.970> vital<00:00:09.360> seconds<00:00:09.750> off<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.800> two<00:00:10.920> types

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
those vital seconds off it's two types

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160 
those vital seconds off it's two types
of<00:00:11.309> turn<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> use<00:00:12.450> for

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
of turn that we like to use for

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.320 
of turn that we like to use for
simplicity<00:00:13.559> sake<00:00:13.920> let's<00:00:14.219> talk<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.210> B

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
simplicity sake let's talk about a and B

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.260 
simplicity sake let's talk about a and B
tens<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.529> 18<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> turn<00:00:17.430> well<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.000> keep<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
tens the 18 is a turn well they keep the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.480 
tens the 18 is a turn well they keep the
engine<00:00:18.539> running<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.900> keep<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.170> power

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
engine running we keep the power

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.519 
engine running we keep the power
underneath<00:00:20.490> our<00:00:20.699> horse<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.900> vital<00:00:22.350> when<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
underneath our horse it's vital when you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.040 
underneath our horse it's vital when you
jump<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:22.859> big<00:00:23.130> jumps<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> B<00:00:24.630> tail<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
jump into big jumps but the B tail is a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
jump into big jumps but the B tail is a
very<00:00:25.350> specific<00:00:25.590> turn<00:00:26.039> where<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> change

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
very specific turn where you change

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.779 
very specific turn where you change
direction<00:00:27.529> losing<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> revs<00:00:28.980> change<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
direction losing all the revs change the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
direction losing all the revs change the
direction<00:00:29.880> very<00:00:30.449> simple<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
direction very simple it's a bit like a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.700 
direction very simple it's a bit like a
handbrake<00:00:32.309> turn<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.210> car<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.750> demonstrate

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
handbrake turn in a car that demonstrate

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.600 
handbrake turn in a car that demonstrate
the<00:00:34.860> two<00:00:35.010> types<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.340> turn<00:00:36.050> see<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.500> an<00:00:37.800> 18

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the two types of turn see this is an 18

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
the two types of turn see this is an 18
you<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.600> I've<00:00:39.690> got<00:00:39.840> him<00:00:39.960> bending<00:00:40.290> around<00:00:40.590> my

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you see I've got him bending around my

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.819 
you see I've got him bending around my
leg<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.570> keeping<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> power<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> rhythm

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
through the canter so if I was pitching

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
through the canter so if I was pitching
him<00:00:46.170> back<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> fence<00:00:47.000> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> type<00:00:48.510> of

him back to a fence this is the type of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
him back to a fence this is the type of
turn<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.590> where<00:00:49.950> they're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
turn that I would use where they're

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.930 
turn that I would use where they're
gonna<00:00:50.969> want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> keep<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> power<00:00:52.850> into<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
gonna want to keep the power into the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.529 
gonna want to keep the power into the
stride<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:55.789> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> quit<00:00:57.059> their<00:00:57.239> actual

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the out this hand to turn that way and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.550 
the out this hand to turn that way and
I'm<00:01:25.430> almost<00:01:26.180> pushing<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.900> I'm<00:01:27.110> keeping<00:01:27.290> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
I'm almost pushing and I'm keeping the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.040 
I'm almost pushing and I'm keeping the
the<00:01:27.800> body<00:01:28.310> straighter<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.870> he's

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the body straighter so the like he's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.610 
the body straighter so the like he's
almost<00:01:30.260> falling<00:01:31.070> through<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.850> turn<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.470> by

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
almost falling through the turn so by

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.440 
almost falling through the turn so by
doing<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.070> he's<00:01:34.310> automatically<00:01:34.970> changing

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
doing so he's automatically changing

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.400 
doing so he's automatically changing
direction<00:01:35.600> because<00:01:35.930> if<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:36.260> he's

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
direction because if you like he's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.190 
direction because if you like he's
falling<00:01:36.920> through<00:01:37.300> okay<00:01:38.300> problem<00:01:38.870> is<00:01:38.990> with

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
falling through okay problem is with

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.470 
falling through okay problem is with
that<00:01:39.320> obviously<00:01:39.740> you're<00:01:39.980> losing<00:01:40.310> balance<00:01:41.060> and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
that obviously you're losing balance and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.120 
that obviously you're losing balance and
any<00:01:41.570> power<00:01:41.900> is<00:01:42.140> almost<00:01:42.380> like<00:01:42.590> you're<00:01:42.740> standing

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
any power is almost like you're standing

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.230 
any power is almost like you're standing
still<00:01:43.400> by<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.700> time<00:01:43.850> you've<00:01:43.970> done<00:01:44.060> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
still by the time you've done it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.390 
still by the time you've done it
so<00:01:44.630> again<00:01:44.810> if<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.020> see<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.380> look<00:01:45.620> even<00:01:46.100> just

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
so again if you see it look even just

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.070 
so again if you see it look even just
here<00:01:46.640> just<00:01:47.240> going<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.450> make<00:01:47.540> him<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.870> it's

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
here just going to make him just it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.030 
here just going to make him just it's
just<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.410> turn<00:01:49.870> there<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.960> go<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
just going to turn there you go so the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920 
just going to turn there you go so the
weight<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.250> turned<00:01:52.670> straighter<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.810> he's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
weight is turned straighter but he's

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.320 
weight is turned straighter but he's
turning<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.410> flat<00:01:54.710> away<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.910> then<00:01:56.030> going<00:01:56.210> by

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
turning a flat away and then going by

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.750 
turning a flat away and then going by
doing<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.810> means<00:01:57.770> I'm<00:01:57.920> facing<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.460> opposite

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
doing that means I'm facing the opposite

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.490 
doing that means I'm facing the opposite
direction<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.540> quicker<00:01:59.810> fashion<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.380> be

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
direction and a quicker fashion to be

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.469 
direction and a quicker fashion to be
able<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.740> get<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.580> next<00:02:01.700> fence<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
able to get to the next fence the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.390 
able to get to the next fence the
problem<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:02.930> I've<00:02:03.080> lost<00:02:03.229> my<00:02:03.380> balance<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.950> I've

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
problem is I've lost my balance and I've

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.640 
problem is I've lost my balance and I've
lost<00:02:04.550> any<00:02:04.729> stride<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.229> wouldn't<00:02:06.410> be<00:02:06.530> any

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
lost any stride so that wouldn't be any

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.320 
lost any stride so that wouldn't be any
good<00:02:06.740> turning<00:02:07.220> back<00:02:07.370> let's<00:02:07.580> say<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.940> big<00:02:08.149> ox

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
good turning back let's say to a big ox

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.240 
good turning back let's say to a big ox
er<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.869> that's<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.740> use<00:02:09.979> a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
er and that's when we have to use a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.550 
er and that's when we have to use a
turns<00:02:10.880> we've<00:02:11.450> got<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.750> both<00:02:11.959> turns<00:02:12.350> in

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
turns we've got to have both turns in

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.949 
turns we've got to have both turns in
our<00:02:12.770> armory<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.610> ultimately<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.180> can't<00:02:14.450> use

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
our armory but ultimately you can't use

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.170 
our armory but ultimately you can't use
them<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.290> wrong<00:02:15.410> place<00:02:15.709> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.400> do<00:02:16.580> you're

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
them in the wrong place if you do you're

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.199 
them in the wrong place if you do you're
gonna<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.450> sunk<00:02:18.430> I'm<00:02:19.430> gonna<00:02:19.850> try<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
gonna be sunk I'm gonna try and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.800 
gonna be sunk I'm gonna try and
demonstrate<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.650> two<00:02:21.830> types<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.340> turn<00:02:22.810> first

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
demonstrate the two types of turn first

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.020 
demonstrate the two types of turn first
one<00:02:24.020> like<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.200> said<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.709> turn<00:02:25.130> where<00:02:25.940> I'm

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
one like I said is the a turn where I'm

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.449 
one like I said is the a turn where I'm
going<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.239> keep<00:02:26.390> my<00:02:26.540> speed<00:02:26.870> I'm<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.769> power<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.370> my

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
going to keep my speed I'm a power of my

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.310 
going to keep my speed I'm a power of my
revs<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.690> hands<00:02:29.959> when<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.170> make

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
revs I'm going to hands when you make

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.560 
revs I'm going to hands when you make
the<00:02:30.440> turn<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.920> away<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.459> go<00:02:31.489> we<00:02:31.790> turn<00:02:32.060> I'm

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the turn and away we go we turn I'm

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.850 
the turn and away we go we turn I'm
going<00:02:32.870> around<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.620> away<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.440> we're<00:02:39.560> gonna<00:02:39.650> do

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
going around and away so we're gonna do

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.430 
going around and away so we're gonna do
now<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> B<00:02:40.280> turn<00:02:40.720> again<00:02:41.720> while<00:02:41.840> you'll<00:02:42.080> notice

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
now the B turn again while you'll notice

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.840 
now the B turn again while you'll notice
straight<00:02:42.709> away<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.950> how<00:02:43.130> much<00:02:43.280> straighter

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
straight away is how much straighter

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.110 
straight away is how much straighter
this<00:02:44.750> turn<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:46.100> also<00:02:46.280> you'll<00:02:46.610> notice<00:02:46.820> how

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
this turn is but also you'll notice how

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.020 
this turn is but also you'll notice how
he<00:02:47.180> loses<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.600> bit<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.930> balance<00:02:48.160> as<00:02:49.160> it'll<00:02:49.880> lose

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
he loses a bit of balance as it'll lose

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.340 
he loses a bit of balance as it'll lose
the<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:50.420> chill<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:50.959> go<00:02:51.170> straight<00:02:52.040> turn

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
the can chill here we go straight turn

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.070 
the can chill here we go straight turn
ya<00:02:54.350> lose<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> balance<00:02:55.540> then<00:02:56.540> how<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.750> ride

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
ya lose it the balance then how to ride

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.460 
ya lose it the balance then how to ride
away<00:02:58.540> okay<00:02:59.540> what<00:02:59.720> I'm<00:02:59.780> gonna<00:02:59.900> do<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.200> show<00:03:00.260> you

away okay what I'm gonna do is show you
here<00:03:00.910> we're<00:03:01.910> jumping<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> fence<00:03:02.330> on<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
here we're jumping the fence on the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.380 
here we're jumping the fence on the
angle<00:03:03.310> then<00:03:04.310> with<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> beater<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.060> directly

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
angle then with a beater and directly

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.410 
angle then with a beater and directly
afterwards<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.489> ten<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.269> go

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
afterwards so now I be ten and we go

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.229 
afterwards so now I be ten and we go
away<00:03:08.630> yeah<00:03:08.920> well<00:03:09.920> done<00:03:10.160> there<00:03:10.340> we've<00:03:10.910> shaved

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
away yeah well done there we've shaved

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.440 
away yeah well done there we've shaved
all<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.930> angles<00:03:12.769> we<00:03:13.580> jumped<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.910> fence<00:03:14.090> on

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
all the angles we jumped the fence on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.290 
all the angles we jumped the fence on
the<00:03:14.660> angle<00:03:14.900> across<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.500> I'm<00:03:15.980> landing<00:03:16.489> dropped

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
the angle across it I'm landing dropped

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.720 
the angle across it I'm landing dropped
inside<00:03:17.690> another<00:03:18.019> fence<00:03:18.320> with<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> B<00:03:19.040> turn<00:03:19.340> and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
inside another fence with a B turn and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.150 
inside another fence with a B turn and
moved<00:03:20.000> away<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.959> quickly<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:21.709> terms<00:03:22.040> of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
moved away really quickly in terms of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.600 
moved away really quickly in terms of
jump<00:03:22.340> off<00:03:22.519> that's<00:03:23.209> what<00:03:23.359> it's<00:03:23.480> all<00:03:23.570> about
