okay

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay
explain<00:00:03.660> to<00:00:03.690> us<00:00:03.810> what<00:00:04.050> you're<00:00:04.170> doing

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.030 

so<00:00:16.190> what<00:00:16.340> was<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.550> deal<00:00:16.700> with<00:00:16.730> this<00:00:17.030> truck

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
so what was the deal with this truck

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.330 
so what was the deal with this truck
start<00:00:19.480> it's<00:00:20.830> starting<00:00:21.830> around<00:00:21.920> no<00:00:22.220> power

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
start it's starting around no power

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.580 
start it's starting around no power
misfiring<00:00:25.340> really<00:00:25.730> bad<00:00:28.779> seem<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.900> miss<00:00:30.140> as

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
misfiring really bad seem to miss as

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.280 
misfiring really bad seem to miss as
much<00:00:30.740> as<00:00:30.950> others<00:00:31.690> they<00:00:32.690> would<00:00:32.809> idle<00:00:33.080> very

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
much as others they would idle very

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.900 
much as others they would idle very
poorly<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.010> what<00:00:34.129> did<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:34.340> find<00:00:34.550> when<00:00:34.850> you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
poorly and what did you find when you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.610 
poorly and what did you find when you
pull<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.660> fuel<00:00:35.870> rails<00:00:36.080> off<00:00:38.620> particularly

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
pull the fuel rails off particularly

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.580 
pull the fuel rails off particularly
rust<00:00:40.370> full<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.390> just<00:00:41.600> chunks<00:00:42.140> of<00:00:42.230> garbage

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
rust full of just chunks of garbage

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.150 
rust full of just chunks of garbage
right<00:00:42.620> yeah<00:00:43.900> okay<00:00:44.900> why<00:00:45.140> did<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.410> happen<00:00:45.650> why

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
right yeah okay why did that happen why

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.520 
right yeah okay why did that happen why
was<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:46.400> all<00:00:46.489> full<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.790> garbage<00:00:47.360> I<00:00:47.780> would<00:00:48.170> guess

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
was it all full of garbage I would guess

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.430 
was it all full of garbage I would guess
that<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.010> fuel<00:00:49.820> filter<00:00:50.239> set<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.170> too<00:00:51.260> long

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
that the fuel filter set it in too long

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.799 
that the fuel filter set it in too long
just<00:00:51.500> penta<00:00:52.010> disintegrating<00:00:52.610> okay<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.660> could

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
just penta disintegrating okay it could

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.380 
just penta disintegrating okay it could
be<00:00:53.989> one<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.500> shop<00:00:54.710> vehicles<00:00:55.160> here<00:00:55.430> sits

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
be one of the shop vehicles here sits

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.620 
be one of the shop vehicles here sits
around<00:00:56.540> sometimes<00:00:57.350> for<00:00:57.590> months<00:00:57.800> at<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.980> time

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
around sometimes for months at a time

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.840 
around sometimes for months at a time
has<00:01:00.040> old<00:01:01.040> fuel<00:01:01.610> in<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:04.210> some<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.390> fuel

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
has old fuel in it and some of that fuel

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.570 
has old fuel in it and some of that fuel
we<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:08.090> corroded<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.020> fuel<00:01:12.229> lines<00:01:15.580> so

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
we just corroded in the fuel lines so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.060 
we just corroded in the fuel lines so
we're<00:01:16.759> checking<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.240> see<00:01:17.479> if<00:01:17.509> these<00:01:18.070> injectors

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
we're checking to see if these injectors

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.180 
we're checking to see if these injectors
are<00:01:19.250> all<00:01:19.369> spraying<00:01:19.819> properly

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
are all spraying properly

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.770 
are all spraying properly
what<00:01:22.790> are<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:22.970> using<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.270> activate<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
what are you using to activate the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.340 
what are you using to activate the
injectors<00:01:24.730> dude<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.630> little<00:01:29.750> injector

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
injectors dude so just a little injector

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.340 
injectors dude so just a little injector
tester<00:01:30.740> like<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.160> use<00:01:31.340> for<00:01:31.370> doing<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
tester like you would use for doing a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.530 
tester like you would use for doing a
injector<00:01:33.350> balanced<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:37.040> then<00:01:37.280> we've<00:01:37.460> got<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.790 

fuel<00:01:41.540> rails<00:01:41.840> are<00:01:42.080> hooked<00:01:42.290> up<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.470> our<00:01:44.800> fuel

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
fuel rails are hooked up to our fuel

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.330 
fuel rails are hooked up to our fuel
injector<00:01:46.250> cleaner<00:01:47.650> so<00:01:48.650> that's<00:01:48.950> what<00:01:49.160> we're

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
injector cleaner so that's what we're

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.780 
injector cleaner so that's what we're
using<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.680> pressurize<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.920> fuel<00:01:52.220> rail<00:01:52.490> as<00:01:52.670> we

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
using to pressurize this fuel rail as we

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:04.950 
using to pressurize this fuel rail as we
go<00:01:52.910> through<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.270> manually<00:01:53.540> test

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.080 

Oh

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.240 

next

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 

so<00:02:19.790> far<00:02:20.000> all<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> injectors<00:02:20.600> look<00:02:20.750> okay<00:02:21.080> but

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so far all the injectors look okay but

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.000 
so far all the injectors look okay but
we've<00:02:22.250> cleaned<00:02:22.580> out<00:02:23.110> seems<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.500> ton<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
we've cleaned out seems like a ton and a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.280 
we've cleaned out seems like a ton and a
half<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.360> garbage<00:02:26.360> out<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.690> fuel<00:02:26.900> line<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
half of garbage out of the fuel line and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.210 
half of garbage out of the fuel line and
out<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.830> rails<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.710> there's<00:02:30.710> obviously<00:02:31.100> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
out of the rails so there's obviously a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.700 
out of the rails so there's obviously a
concern<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.450> screens<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.200> top<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.590> each

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
concern that the screens on top of each

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.200 
concern that the screens on top of each
fuel<00:02:34.010> injector<00:02:34.460> to<00:02:34.670> potentially<00:02:35.510> water<00:02:37.210> or

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
fuel injector to potentially water or

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.050 
fuel injector to potentially water or
that<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.810> nozzles<00:02:39.260> could<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.430> problem

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
that the nozzles could have a problem

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.520 
that the nozzles could have a problem
that<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:41.420> far<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.810> looks<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.080> they're<00:02:42.380> all

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
that so far it looks like they're all

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:59.240 
that so far it looks like they're all
spraying<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.280> fine

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.290 

did<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.400> one<00:03:00.520> act<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.820> little<00:03:00.910> weird<00:03:01.180> that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
did that one act a little weird that

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.320 
did that one act a little weird that
again<00:03:01.660> bad<00:03:05.220> maybe<00:03:06.220> had<00:03:06.490> air<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.000> your<00:03:07.150> all

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
again bad maybe had air in it your all

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.210 
again bad maybe had air in it your all
could<00:03:08.050> have<00:03:08.140> been<00:03:08.200> an<00:03:08.350> air<00:03:08.470> pocket<00:03:08.740> because

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
could have been an air pocket because

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.550 
could have been an air pocket because
we've<00:03:09.370> got<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> returnless<00:03:10.960> or<00:03:11.380> not<00:03:11.530> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we've got this is a returnless or not a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.380 
we've got this is a returnless or not a
return<00:03:11.860> list<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.220> return<00:03:12.520> type<00:03:12.790> system

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
return list it's a return type system

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.860 
return list it's a return type system
but<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.110> return<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.800> all<00:03:15.690> associated<00:03:16.690> with

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
but the return is all associated with

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.620 
but the return is all associated with
the<00:03:17.050> other<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.209> other<00:03:19.330> rail

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the other it's all on the other rail

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.960 
the other it's all on the other rail
over<00:03:19.660> here<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.560> there's<00:03:20.740> our<00:03:20.920> regulator<00:03:21.490> you

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
over here so there's our regulator you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.949 
over here so there's our regulator you
can<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.300> we've<00:03:22.480> got<00:03:22.830> we've<00:03:23.830> got<00:03:24.040> about<00:03:24.510> 16<00:03:25.510> 17

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
can see we've got we've got about 16 17

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.199 
can see we've got we've got about 16 17
inches<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.620> mercury<00:03:26.770> on<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.370> vacuum<00:03:27.580> pump<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
inches of mercury on this vacuum pump so

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.910 
inches of mercury on this vacuum pump so
that<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.630> proper<00:03:29.050> fuel<00:03:29.290> pressure<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.830> our

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
that we have proper fuel pressure in our

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.449 
that we have proper fuel pressure in our
rail<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:31.180> over<00:03:31.450> here<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.590> tube<00:03:32.800> crosses<00:03:33.280> over

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
rail but over here the tube crosses over

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.010 
rail but over here the tube crosses over
to<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.670> other<00:03:33.850> rail<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.330> if<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.570> had<00:03:34.750> some

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
to that other rail and if we had some

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.360 
to that other rail and if we had some
air<00:03:35.200> trapped<00:03:35.500> over<00:03:35.800> here<00:03:37.950> okay<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.190> think

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
air trapped over here okay so you think

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.080 
air trapped over here okay so you think
the<00:03:39.459> injectors<00:03:39.880> are<00:03:40.030> good<00:03:41.580> without<00:03:42.580> without

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
the injectors are good without without

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.390 
the injectors are good without without
any<00:03:43.150> doubt

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
any doubt

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.030 
any doubt
really

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.959 

right<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.290> everything<00:03:50.290> seems<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.709> working

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:50.969 
right so everything seems to be working

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.459 
right so everything seems to be working
now<00:03:51.969> provided<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.689> we've<00:03:52.810> got<00:03:52.959> all<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.230> fuel

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:53.469 
now provided that we've got all the fuel

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.580 
now provided that we've got all the fuel
out<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.069> fuel<00:03:54.400> lines<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:56.170> thing<00:03:56.439> ought

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
out of the fuel lines this thing ought

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.069 
out of the fuel lines this thing ought
to<00:03:56.739> run<00:03:56.890> well
