00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
commentary fairly fast paced but in this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
commentary fairly fast paced but in this
game<00:01:16.979> it'll<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.759> relaxed<00:01:17.880> just

looking single gate build a low it looks

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.650

a wall either in this location here just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
here so they can just grab the expansion

straightaway<00:03:28.950> down<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:30.200> not<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
straightaway down here and not have to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320 
straightaway down here and not have to
worry<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.950> much<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.130> us<00:03:32.400> coming<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:32.970> if

worry so much about us coming in but if

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.270 
worry so much about us coming in but if
you're<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.870> programmer<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.920> you're<00:03:35.010> fairly

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
you're a programmer and you're fairly

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.640 
you're a programmer and you're fairly
comfort<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:35.760> your<00:03:35.880> micromanagement

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
there's really not too much need to put

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.170 
there's really not too much need to put
a<00:03:40.380> wall<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.400> save<00:03:41.610> yourself<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
a wall in and you can save yourself just

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.230 
a wall in and you can save yourself just
a<00:03:42.270> little<00:03:42.540> bit<00:03:42.660> bit<00:03:43.020> extra<00:03:43.260> by<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:44.130> here

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
a little bit bit extra by going here

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.340 
a little bit bit extra by going here
watch<00:03:45.240> what<00:03:45.420> he's<00:03:45.540> done<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.230> has

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
watch what he's done here that has

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.380 
night it's very interesting if this is
not<00:03:53.160> standard<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.850> wouldn't<00:03:54.120> really<00:03:54.300> recommend

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
this on on this map before actually so

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.000 
this on on this map before actually so
maybe<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.180> just<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.960> again<00:04:43.470> at<00:04:43.770> NATO

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
maybe this is just that again at NATO

prolong it for a while I mean usually

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.070 
prolong it for a while I mean usually
you<00:06:17.639> need<00:06:17.820> siege<00:06:18.090> tech<00:06:18.300> if<00:06:18.450> you've<00:06:18.630> got<00:06:18.810> your

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
you need siege tech if you've got your

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.990 
you need siege tech if you've got your

shooting out shooting down your tanks

shooting out shooting down your tanks
and<00:06:25.110> there's<00:06:25.289> not<00:06:25.530> that<00:06:25.560> much<00:06:25.919> you<00:06:26.130> can<00:06:26.250> do

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
and there's not that much you can do

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.029 
and there's not that much you can do
that's<00:06:27.750> why<00:06:27.900> some<00:06:28.200> players<00:06:28.470> like<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.919> get

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
that's why some players like to get

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.440 
that's why some players like to get
siege<00:06:29.220> attack<00:06:29.430> early<00:06:29.729> i<00:06:29.760> know<00:06:29.940> that<00:06:30.180> i<00:06:30.210> often

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
siege attack early i know that i often

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.470 
siege attack early i know that i often
do<00:06:30.690> that

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
do that

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.480 
do that
just<00:06:31.690> because<00:06:31.990> of<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.710> comfort<00:06:32.950> factor<00:06:33.220> but

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
just because of the comfort factor but

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.340 
just because of the comfort factor but
if<00:06:34.120> you're<00:06:34.360> really<00:06:34.390> confident<00:06:34.930> with<00:06:35.110> laying

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
if you're really confident with laying

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.590 
if you're really confident with laying
mines<00:06:35.620> down<00:06:35.980> that<00:06:36.820> can<00:06:37.000> actually<00:06:37.120> be<00:06:37.300> even

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
mines down that can actually be even

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.660 
mines down that can actually be even
better<00:06:37.720> because<00:06:37.960> mines<00:06:38.530> are<00:06:38.980> a<00:06:39.340> little<00:06:39.490> bit

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
better because mines are a little bit

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.370 
better because mines are a little bit
cheaper<00:06:40.030> of<00:06:40.060> an<00:06:40.180> upgrade<00:06:40.330> they're<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.140> little

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
cheaper of an upgrade they're a little

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.400 
cheaper of an upgrade they're a little
more<00:06:41.500> flexible<00:06:42.130> they<00:06:42.280> they<00:06:43.240> do<00:06:43.690> protect<00:06:44.290> you

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
more flexible they they do protect you

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.840 
more flexible they they do protect you
against<00:06:44.650> dark<00:06:44.890> templars<00:06:45.310> as<00:06:45.520> well<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:47.850> you

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
against dark templars as well and you

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.610 
against dark templars as well and you
can<00:06:48.880> always<00:06:49.210> just<00:06:49.360> get<00:06:49.570> seeds<00:06:49.930> later<00:06:50.230> because

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
can always just get seeds later because

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.080 
can always just get seeds later because
the<00:06:50.770> dragoons<00:06:51.130> can't<00:06:51.340> really<00:06:51.580> come<00:06:51.760> in<00:06:51.910> and

the dragoons can't really come in and

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.760 
the dragoons can't really come in and
they<00:06:52.570> have<00:06:52.660> to<00:06:52.750> wait<00:06:52.900> for<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.080> observers<00:06:53.620> is

they have to wait for the observers is

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.530

because<00:07:10.450> the<00:07:10.630> they're<00:07:11.020> fairly<00:07:11.230> isolated<00:07:11.440> and

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
because the they're fairly isolated and

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.880 
because the they're fairly isolated and
they<00:07:12.400> just<00:07:12.790> have<00:07:12.880> the<00:07:13.000> one<00:07:13.180> ramp<00:07:13.770> but<00:07:14.770> they've

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
they just have the one ramp but they've

they just have the one ramp but they've

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
got the double gas vents so you can go

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.660 
got the double gas vents so you can go
for<00:07:16.810> a<00:07:17.170> pretty<00:07:17.710> tech<00:07:18.040> heavy<00:07:18.280> build<00:07:18.460> if<00:07:18.580> you

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 
for a pretty tech heavy build if you

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.490 
for a pretty tech heavy build if you
manage<00:07:18.910> to<00:07:18.940> secure<00:07:19.300> these<00:07:19.540> expenses<00:07:20.110> early<00:07:20.380> on

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
and that's what bc was done so maybe

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.820 
and that's what bc was done so maybe
we'll<00:07:22.090> see<00:07:22.300> something<00:07:22.510> like<00:07:22.600> carriers<00:07:23.140> or

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
we'll see something like carriers or

we'll see something like carriers or
something<00:07:24.100> like<00:07:24.160> that<00:07:24.660> native<00:07:25.660> interesting

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
something like that native interesting

doesn't need marines anymore but maybe

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.070 
doesn't need marines anymore but maybe
he'll<00:07:30.670> scout<00:07:30.970> this<00:07:31.150> and<00:07:31.360> try<00:07:31.780> and<00:07:31.870> pull<00:07:31.990> off

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
he'll scout this and try and pull off

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.420 
he'll scout this and try and pull off
some<00:07:32.260> kind<00:07:32.410> of<00:07:32.500> time<00:07:32.710> and<00:07:32.890> push<00:07:33.040> given<00:07:33.340> the

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
some kind of time and push given the

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.970 
some kind of time and push given the
fact<00:07:33.610> that<00:07:33.670> BS<00:07:34.330> who<00:07:34.450> does<00:07:34.630> seem<00:07:34.900> to<00:07:34.930> be<00:07:35.080> really

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
fact that BS who does seem to be really

committing<00:07:36.280> to<00:07:36.400> a<00:07:36.430> lot<00:07:36.640> of<00:07:36.870> attack<00:07:37.870> as<00:07:38.080> we've

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
committing to a lot of attack as we've

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.960 
committing to a lot of attack as we've
seen<00:07:38.500> as<00:07:38.950> well<00:07:39.190> as<00:07:39.340> early<00:07:39.640> expansions<00:07:40.300> and<00:07:40.510> I

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
seen as well as early expansions and I

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.130 
seen as well as early expansions and I
guess<00:07:42.970> Nader<00:07:43.240> has<00:07:43.450> an<00:07:43.540> opportunity<00:07:43.690> if<00:07:44.050> he

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140 
guess Nader has an opportunity if he

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.440 
guess Nader has an opportunity if he
just<00:07:44.320> switches<00:07:44.920> to<00:07:45.160> a<00:07:45.520> sex<00:07:45.820> factories<00:07:46.270> and

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
just switches to a sex factories and

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.160 
just switches to a sex factories and
just<00:07:46.630> really<00:07:46.750> goes<00:07:46.960> for<00:07:47.170> an<00:07:47.230> all-out<00:07:49.170> real

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.170 
just really goes for an all-out real

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.960 
just really goes for an all-out real
real<00:07:50.500> kind<00:07:50.680> of<00:07:50.770> push<00:07:50.980> here<00:07:51.280> with<00:07:51.640> a<00:07:51.670> lot<00:07:51.940> of

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970 
real kind of push here with a lot of

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.850 
real kind of push here with a lot of
units<00:07:52.360> and<00:07:52.570> beasts<00:07:52.870> who<00:07:53.020> doesn't<00:07:53.320> have<00:07:53.500> that

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860 
units and beasts who doesn't have that

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.470 
units and beasts who doesn't have that
many<00:07:54.010> units<00:07:54.280> I<00:07:54.370> mean<00:07:54.490> he's<00:07:54.760> got<00:07:54.880> a<00:07:54.940> substantial

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:55.480 
many units I mean he's got a substantial

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.060 
many units I mean he's got a substantial
amount<00:07:55.570> he's<00:07:56.050> got<00:07:56.080> enough<00:07:56.470> to<00:07:56.620> hold<00:07:56.770> off<00:07:56.920> any

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.070 
amount he's got enough to hold off any

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.560 
amount he's got enough to hold off any
kind<00:07:57.340> of<00:07:57.400> attack<00:07:57.640> at<00:07:57.790> this<00:07:57.910> point<00:07:58.120> in<00:07:58.210> time<00:07:58.240> but

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570 
kind of attack at this point in time but

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.150 
kind of attack at this point in time but
it's<00:07:59.110> going<00:07:59.230> to<00:07:59.320> be<00:07:59.440> a<00:07:59.470> little<00:07:59.770> while<00:07:59.980> before

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 
it's going to be a little while before

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.910 
it's going to be a little while before
he<00:08:00.430> gets<00:08:00.640> any<00:08:00.820> real<00:08:01.390> mileage<00:08:02.260> out<00:08:02.410> of<00:08:02.470> these

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:02.920 
he gets any real mileage out of these

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.560 
he gets any real mileage out of these
expansions<00:08:03.430> here<00:08:03.610> so<00:08:04.210> just<00:08:04.390> a<00:08:04.450> quick

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:04.570 
expansions here so just a quick

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.930 
expansions here so just a quick
trade-off<00:08:05.050> of<00:08:05.080> units<00:08:05.530> here<00:08:05.740> NATO<00:08:06.460> obviously

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:06.940 
trade-off of units here NATO obviously

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.220 
trade-off of units here NATO obviously
wants<00:08:07.120> to<00:08:07.150> come<00:08:07.360> in<00:08:07.510> and<00:08:07.630> perhaps<00:08:07.900> take<00:08:08.140> a

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.230 
wants to come in and perhaps take a

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.680 
wants to come in and perhaps take a
third<00:08:08.470> base<00:08:08.710> and<00:08:08.980> he'll<00:08:09.760> be<00:08:09.970> large<00:08:10.180> and<00:08:10.300> you'll

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.690 
third base and he'll be large and you'll

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.430 
third base and he'll be large and you'll
be<00:08:10.990> able<00:08:11.080> to<00:08:11.230> do<00:08:11.350> that<00:08:11.500> bc<00:08:11.830> i<00:08:11.980> ain't<00:08:12.190> got<00:08:12.250> any
