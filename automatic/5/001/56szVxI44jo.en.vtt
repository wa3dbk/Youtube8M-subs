00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.950
 value 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.040

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.670
 and casual at the same time one for the fourth of 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.710
 circular cut in black that could 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.720
 look very formal and be ideal for 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.940

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.920
 Perfect option for the afternoon when adding 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.810
 the flower jacket the design of this 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.590

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.260
 best-selling items of this season 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.480
 and to finish we have a new cause 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.370

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.740

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.690
 Perfect unisex garment for any 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.460
 this kid looks like a whole 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.460
 star with that call with stuffed animal 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.290
 besides to see super warm this with 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.529
 a white shirt the jeans is my 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.269
 ideal option 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.189
 If you still do not have this garment in your 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:03.629
 closet run for one I'm sure that 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.209
 they will find it very easy that they are going 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.649
 to use a lot we are going to a cut 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.749
 but do not move because when you go back 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:11.579
 we are going to make these separators that 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:16.399
