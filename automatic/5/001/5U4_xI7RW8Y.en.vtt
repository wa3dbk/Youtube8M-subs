this<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:24.659> works<00:01:24.930> already<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this pretty much works already on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.310 
this pretty much works already on the
galaxy<00:01:26.070> s4<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.790> galaxy<00:01:27.240> note<00:01:27.390> 3<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.840> obviously

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
galaxy s4 and galaxy note 3 so obviously

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
galaxy s4 and galaxy note 3 so obviously
this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> piece<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> cake<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.909> when

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this is a piece of cake let's see when

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.640 
this is a piece of cake let's see when
no<00:01:30.360> gift<00:01:30.630> figures<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.470> obviously

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
no gift figures is out because obviously

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.310 
no gift figures is out because obviously

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
coprocessor from the iphone 5s and think

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.430 
coprocessor from the iphone 5s and think
of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.340> whole<00:03:38.549> concept<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.330> iWatch<00:03:39.840> could

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
of the whole concept of the iWatch could

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.990 
of the whole concept of the iWatch could
it<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.650> Apple<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.190> taking<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.880> whole

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
it be that Apple is taking the whole

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.150 
it be that Apple is taking the whole
iwatch<00:03:42.480> concept<00:03:42.780> into<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> fitness<00:03:43.680> thing<00:03:43.890> as

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the best direction that Apple should

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.880 
the best direction that Apple should
orient<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.720> eyewash<00:03:55.140> do<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.500> feel<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
my particular case I feel that it would

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.699 
my particular case I feel that it would
be<00:04:00.030> awesome<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.630> would<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.930> cool<00:04:01.320> but<00:04:01.350> then

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
be awesome it would be cool but then

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.470 
be awesome it would be cool but then
again<00:04:01.799> there<00:04:02.130> are<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.610> lot<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.030> competitors
