00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.100
 good i am wiggins and in this video os 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.380
 I ask to return to obtain the 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.120
 plantation carrots as their 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.270
 different uses both in food and in 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.270
 animals 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.280
 and then we're going to use servers in mode 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.200
 creative to be able to make a 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.680
 explanation much simpler though in 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.630
 this case miss some things 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 us the first this world to 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.350
 show you how to obtain the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.690
 carrot 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.430
 the main manna is to find it in the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.040
 villagers villages that generates in a way 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.900
 random to the game may appear in 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.160
 different languages ​​how can it be so much 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.060
 sand hills very close to forests 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.060
 and other sites 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.030
 for each one that you break of carrot 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.620
 among other units and as I said 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.720
 this is the new detection much more 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.720
 simple the other way 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 would be 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.700
 thus killing zombies 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 by magazine 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.159
 the game allows the zombies 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 I celebrate 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 both potato start to give the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.640
 reformatory after killing them 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 with the death of the cendis then in this 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.060
 case they have given us only zombie meat 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 could part of your band enter 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.230
 carrot but with one already enough 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.570
 to perform the entire plantation so 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.570
 there would not be any problem about it 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.289
 today we have 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.159
 its plantation is very simple only 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.829
 he really wants light and a couple of 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.649
 buckets of water to avoid a little cough 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.450
 that the earth is parched we are going to put them 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.360
 for example here 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.880
 and here we will put the light if you want 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.590
 we can go and planting and now we add 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.590
 the extras to the plantation 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.240
 if you notice you are starting to jump 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.400
 the carrots although many of them 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.680
 all because the earth is parched 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.310
 these 15 days can also happen with 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.370
 the wheat I think is less usual 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.239
 means that you need nothing to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.239
 improve the earth 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.510
 very well 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.530
 very well we light the last tasks 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.770
 that if you realize they have no seed 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.970
 they are directly 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.400
 already the carrot and this would be a song of 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.349
 carrots furniture 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.549
 We return to peaceful way to avoid 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.549
 bother us no monster 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.730
 This is the night of a definitive cat 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.730
 the carrots 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.810
 As you can see, you can see the orange tree 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.480
 sounding on the ground and again 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.489
 here is that it breaks and they sound separate you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.210
 between 1 and 3 in this case the beloved ones 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.190
 etc 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.640
 we have the how are you 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.220
 the villages the gathering and what is 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.350
 a final plantation also like the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.710
 they can trip zombies to serve 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.710
 the carrots 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.390
 Its main function is food but 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.990
 before we are going to explain a series of 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.480
 functions that do 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.610
 with us they are able to attract them 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.850
 how does this little guy from here 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.190
 is a bit stunned and they make us 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.890
 follow which allows us to move and 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.230
 take them anywhere and be able to 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.030
 lock them in stable for us 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.410
 as well 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.690
 let's follow carrots let us your 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.130
 reproduction is like the equivalent to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.930
 wheat for the ears if to the cows 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.650
 but in this case the solar works 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 with the pigs 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.290
 is everything that we will see the tables follow 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.290
 doing the little things for them 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.770
 the carrot of the night walk 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.560
 feeding yourself with it cures you 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.030
 thighs of life therefore it is a 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.740
 pretty balanced food and how 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.120
 you see with tennis a few ducks so hundred 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.680
 but growth 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.180
 however they have other functions but 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.380
 also provides for the creation of a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.310
 the table is not available 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.310
 on the other hand 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.420
 If used 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.620
 a rope soon 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.620
 the stick with rope 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 that this was back 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.000
 we have the fishing rod and once 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 we got the fishing rod 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 would be 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.860
 everything in the with carrot according to 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.249
 how it was placed 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.709
 on this diagonal it will sound in one size 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.470
 we have the area area of a reed 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.770
 to return for the external 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.500
 hello little pigs we follow 6 when 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.990
 admit that they have anchored in the hours 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.530
 in the monsters that is the chair of 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.480
 ride when we got it we put 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.580
 This will allow us to count the 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.750
 pigs however nothing we looked at anything 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.730
 the balances move in a 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.090
 completely random and we left 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.550
 move 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.940
 to see in the direction in which 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.590
 we use the pig going to walk so 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.770
 both allow us to have a mount 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.580
 Minecraft 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.580
 to download them 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.379
 that 's right and it runs more perfect 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.740
 the truth is that it is quite entertaining 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.710
 if we remove it they stop and we lower them 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.350
 with the right button 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.569
 to recover the saddle it 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.179
 kill the pig 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.879
 good as you see these are the uses of 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:03.099
 neighborhood area quite simple to 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.120
 feeding so much for the upbringing of 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.370
 pigs as well as their sale 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.290
 when the skill of the 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.620
 carrot defeat or explain in another 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.000
 video and as you can see also your attention is 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.850
 simple or in the villages of the 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.430
 healthy or a herrera troop of 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.860
 trains 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.840
