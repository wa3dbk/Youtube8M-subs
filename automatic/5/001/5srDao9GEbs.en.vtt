00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
right here as you can see guys we have a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.640 
right here as you can see guys we have a
pig<00:01:20.190> spawner<00:01:20.760> ok<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.780> glitch<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pig spawner ok that's a glitch this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
pig spawner ok that's a glitch this
should<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> zombie<00:01:23.100> spawner<00:01:23.370> and<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.180> next

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
should be a zombie spawner and your next

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
should be a zombie spawner and your next
which<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.870> another<00:01:25.320> zombie<00:01:25.560> spawner<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.159> guess

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
