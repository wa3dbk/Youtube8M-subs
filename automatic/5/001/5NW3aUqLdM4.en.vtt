00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
hi my name's John little from MEAP and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
hi my name's John little from MEAP and
today<00:00:12.719> we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> talk<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.620> new

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
today we're going to talk about the new

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
today we're going to talk about the new
method<00:00:14.130> feeders<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.389> everyone<00:00:15.780> all

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
method feeders that was everyone all

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930 
method feeders that was everyone all
know<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.260> method<00:00:16.770> feeder<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.190> pretty<00:00:17.730> much

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
know that method feeder is pretty much

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.340 
know that method feeder is pretty much
transformed<00:00:18.600> feed<00:00:18.810> efficient<00:00:19.199> within

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
transformed feed efficient within

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
transformed feed efficient within
commercials<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.689> only<00:00:21.810> natural<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
commercials so it was only natural that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.160 
commercials so it was only natural that
maybe<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.430> started<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> develop<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> range<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
maybe we started to develop a range of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
maybe we started to develop a range of
method<00:00:25.439> feeders<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.490> I've<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> two

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
method feeders here I've got the two

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
method feeders here I've got the two
sizes<00:00:27.900> you've<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> large<00:00:28.800> size<00:00:29.160> which

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
sizes you've got the large size which

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
sizes you've got the large size which
comes<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.359> 30<00:00:30.570> gram<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> 15<00:00:31.500> gram<00:00:31.800> you've<00:00:32.430> also

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
comes in 30 gram and 15 gram you've also

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.860 
comes in 30 gram and 15 gram you've also
got<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> small<00:00:33.090> size<00:00:33.329> which<00:00:33.480> comes<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
got the small size which comes in the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.650 
got the small size which comes in the
same<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.440> 30<00:00:34.890> gram<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.219> 15<00:00:35.550> gram<00:00:35.790> first

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
same way it's 30 gram and 15 gram first

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.100 
same way it's 30 gram and 15 gram first
of<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:36.989> I'll<00:00:37.200> show<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> inline<00:00:38.040> feeder

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
of all I'll show you the inline feeder

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.470 
of all I'll show you the inline feeder
so<00:00:40.110> we've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> inline<00:00:40.680> feeder<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.480> as

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so we've got the inline feeder here as

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
so we've got the inline feeder here as
you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> tube<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.219> runs

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you can see it's got a tube that runs

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.880 
you can see it's got a tube that runs
through<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> body<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.960> feeder<00:00:46.200> which

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
through the body of the feeder which

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
through the body of the feeder which
then<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.219> line<00:00:47.370> runs<00:00:47.640> through<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> can

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
then your line runs through like I can

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
then your line runs through like I can
show<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> you've<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.449> line

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
show you here so you've got your line

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.860 
show you here so you've got your line
running<00:00:51.840> through<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.199> feeder<00:00:53.870> which

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
running through your feeder which

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
running through your feeder which
enables<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> feeder<00:00:55.710> obviously<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.550> free

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
enables the feeder obviously be free

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.939 
enables the feeder obviously be free
running<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.170> commercial

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
running as on a lot of commercial

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.200 
running as on a lot of commercial
fisheries<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.969> allowed<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fisheries you're not actually allowed to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
fisheries you're not actually allowed to
use<00:01:00.420> elasticated<00:01:00.930> feeders<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:02.219> benefit<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
use elasticated feeders one benefit of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.520 
use elasticated feeders one benefit of
this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> break<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.899> obviously<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
this is if you break off obviously the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.859 
this is if you break off obviously the
fish<00:01:04.680> isn't<00:01:04.830> dragging<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> feeder<00:01:05.460> around

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
fish isn't dragging the feeder around

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
fish isn't dragging the feeder around
also<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.650> no<00:01:07.680> resistance<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> fish

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
also there is no resistance on the fish

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
also there is no resistance on the fish
when<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> stripped<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> strike<00:01:10.350> or

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
when it's stripped when you strike or

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
when it's stripped when you strike or
when<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> fish<00:01:11.010> picks<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.420> move

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
when the fish picks a bit up it can move

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
when the fish picks a bit up it can move
away<00:01:12.750> enough<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.860> feeling<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> resistance

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
away enough not feeling the resistance

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
away enough not feeling the resistance
of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> feeder<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.619> from

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
of the feeder now as you can see from

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910 
of the feeder now as you can see from
these<00:01:16.890> feeders<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.970> basically<00:01:18.710> put<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
these feeders we basically put in the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
these feeders we basically put in the
middle<00:01:20.159> group<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> middle<00:01:20.909> rib<00:01:21.540> we've<00:01:22.170> put

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
middle group in the middle rib we've put

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
middle group in the middle rib we've put
a<00:01:22.409> group<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:23.250> allows<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> push<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> bit

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
a group which allows you to push a bit

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.140 
a group which allows you to push a bit
it<00:01:24.570> also<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:26.369> ribs<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.970> got

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it also these these ribs have got

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
it also these these ribs have got
grooves<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> inner<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.979> means<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
grooves on the inner this means that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
grooves on the inner this means that
when<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> push<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.960> bit

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
when you push your bit in the bit

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
when you push your bit in the bit
actually<00:01:31.380> goes<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.040> grab<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.549> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
actually goes you grab it or your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.069 
actually goes you grab it or your
palates<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.180> goes<00:01:33.329> behind<00:01:33.540> which

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
palates actually goes behind which

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
palates actually goes behind which
increases<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> friction<00:01:35.090> respect<00:01:36.090> which

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
increases the friction respect which

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
increases the friction respect which
means<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.200> bit<00:01:37.409> doesn't<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.829> fall

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
means that the bit doesn't actually fall

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.630 
means that the bit doesn't actually fall
out<00:01:39.650> I'll<00:01:40.650> show<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> quickly<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
out I'll show you quickly on the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
out I'll show you quickly on the
elasticated<00:01:42.630> ones<00:01:42.960> again<00:01:43.470> you've<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
elasticated ones again you've got the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
elasticated ones again you've got the
tube<00:01:44.250> running<00:01:44.520> through<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> center<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
tube running through the center of the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.749 
tube running through the center of the
earth<00:01:45.420> feeder<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.610> new

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
earth feeder this time we have the new

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.030 
earth feeder this time we have the new
mop<00:01:48.000> hollow<00:01:48.270> elastic<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> equivalent

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
mop hollow elastic in this is equivalent

or use the snap ring swivel personally

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
or use the snap ring swivel personally
I'd<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.570> snap<00:02:00.840> link<00:02:01.049> swivel<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.009> allows

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I'd use snap link swivel as it allows

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
I'd use snap link swivel as it allows
obviously<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.939> when<00:02:03.420> you're<00:02:03.540> winding<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
line up now with the LEDs there's so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
line up now with the LEDs there's so
many<00:02:09.330> feeders<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.500> seeing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
many feeders out there and you're seeing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.229 
many feeders out there and you're seeing
them<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.039> already<00:02:11.370> where<00:02:11.640> they've<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.090> got

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
them all already where they've just got

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.940 
them all already where they've just got
the<00:02:12.330> lead<00:02:12.510> pin<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> back

the lead pin to the back

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
the lead pin to the back
your<00:02:14.160> leg<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.550> brick<00:02:14.819> break<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.569> pins<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
your leg can brick break the pins you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.710 
your leg can brick break the pins you
know<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.440> looks<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.800> bit<00:02:16.830> untidy<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.540> what

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
know it just looks a bit untidy so what

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.970 
know it just looks a bit untidy so what
we've<00:02:18.870> done<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.200> we've<00:02:19.349> used<00:02:19.470> Ravel<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
we've done is we've used Ravel and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.940 
we've done is we've used Ravel and
layered<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.370> actually<00:02:20.700> zinc<00:02:21.000> which<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
layered it's actually zinc which is a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.710 
layered it's actually zinc which is a
courted<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> basically<00:02:24.599> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
courted with a with like a basically a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960 
courted with a with like a basically a
paint<00:02:25.050> which<00:02:25.560> protects<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.129> lead<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.580> also

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
paint which protects the lead and also

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.550 
paint which protects the lead and also
blends<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.450> feeder<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> base<00:02:28.349> of

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
blends the feeder in with the base of

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.300 
blends the feeder in with the base of
the<00:02:28.910> leg<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.090> efficient<00:02:30.510> we've<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.380> tried

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the leg the efficient we've also tried

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.300 
the leg the efficient we've also tried
to<00:02:33.080> mold<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> leg<00:02:34.410> around<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.739> actual<00:02:34.920> feeder

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
to mold the leg around the actual feeder

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.400 
to mold the leg around the actual feeder
this<00:02:35.550> helps<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> aerodynamic<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
this helps with the aerodynamic of the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.839 
this helps with the aerodynamic of the
feeder<00:02:37.650> when<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.099> table<00:02:38.519> V<00:02:38.610> ously<00:02:38.760> when

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
feeder when you table V ously when

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.940 
feeder when you table V ously when
you're<00:02:38.970> casting<00:02:39.120> out<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.200> air<00:02:40.410> feeder<00:02:40.650> fly<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you're casting out the air feeder fly is

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.220 
you're casting out the air feeder fly is
a<00:02:41.040> lot<00:02:41.190> straighter<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.910> also<00:02:42.720> when<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.019> on

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
a lot straighter and also when it's on

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.720 
a lot straighter and also when it's on
the<00:02:43.349> bed<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.799> prevents<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.370> feeder<00:02:44.580> from

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the bed it prevents your feeder from

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.370 
the bed it prevents your feeder from
topping<00:02:45.150> over<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:45.840> you've<00:02:46.019> got<00:02:46.170> weight

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
and one of the problems that as a match

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.420 
and one of the problems that as a match
angler<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.959> found<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.340> obviously

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
angler I found is that you obviously

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.920 
angler I found is that you obviously
you've<00:03:11.760> got<00:03:11.940> other<00:03:12.090> beads<00:03:12.360> where<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
you've got other beads where you have to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.809 
you've got other beads where you have to
slide<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.410> plastic<00:03:13.610> obviously<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:14.700> your

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
slide the plastic obviously when your

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.000 
slide the plastic obviously when your
hands<00:03:14.970> are<00:03:15.120> called<00:03:15.390> when<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> wet<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.709> gets

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hands are called when the wet it gets

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.440 
hands are called when the wet it gets
increasingly<00:03:17.310> difficult<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:18.060> slide<00:03:18.269> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
increasingly difficult to slide that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.080 
increasingly difficult to slide that
bead<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.829> what<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.069> aim<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:20.549> was<00:03:20.760> create<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
bead so what we aim to do was create a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.400 
bead so what we aim to do was create a
bead<00:03:21.329> where<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:21.870> actually<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:22.260> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
bead where you don't actually have to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.920 
bead where you don't actually have to
slide<00:03:22.650> anything<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.359> line<00:03:24.569> actually

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
slide anything and the line actually

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.599 
slide anything and the line actually
slides<00:03:25.440> through<00:03:25.739> locks<00:03:26.190> into<00:03:26.400> position

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
slides through locks into position

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.059 
slides through locks into position
without<00:03:27.000> actually<00:03:27.569> having<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.470> move<00:03:28.769> anything

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
without actually having to move anything

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.160 
without actually having to move anything
I'll<00:03:29.700> show<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> how<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.299> works<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> air

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
I'll show you how this works on the air

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.970 
I'll show you how this works on the air
in<00:03:31.380> line<00:03:31.799> one<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.079> have<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.829> hook

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
in line one now so you have your hook

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.890 
in line one now so you have your hook
length<00:03:38.600> yep<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.560> bead<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:42.269> slide<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> round

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
like that you saw how quick that was

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.379 
like that you saw how quick that was
obviously<00:03:56.250> one<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.609> vital<00:03:56.910> parts<00:03:57.239> when

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
obviously one of the vital parts when

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.610 
obviously one of the vital parts when
you're<00:03:57.510> method<00:03:57.780> feeder<00:03:58.019> fishing<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.470> be

you're method feeder fishing is to be

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.860 
you're method feeder fishing is to be
able<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.859> speed<00:03:59.310> and<00:04:00.000> one<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.720> key

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.720 
able to speed and one of the key
elements<00:04:00.989> we<00:04:01.380> identified<00:04:01.950> was<00:04:02.190> changing<00:04:02.609> your

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
elements we identified was changing your

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.699 
elements we identified was changing your
hook<00:04:02.849> length<00:04:03.090> quickly<00:04:03.569> length<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.109> its<00:04:04.290> size<00:04:04.680> a

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.659 
hook bit etc by doing this connector
it's<00:04:08.910> enabled<00:04:09.359> as<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:10.230> where<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.769> do<00:04:11.489> this

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
it's enabled as to where to do this

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.430 
it's enabled as to where to do this
basically<00:04:11.970> I'll<00:04:12.630> show<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.930> quickly<00:04:13.049> how<00:04:13.290> to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
basically I'll show you quickly how to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.069 
basically I'll show you quickly how to
get<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.709> off<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:14.370> get<00:04:15.030> your<00:04:15.209> line<00:04:15.389> slide<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
get it off you get your line slide it

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.440 
get it off you get your line slide it
underneath<00:04:16.349> one<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.829> teeth<00:04:17.389> swivel<00:04:18.389> it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
underneath one of the teeth swivel it

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.479 
underneath one of the teeth swivel it
round<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.139> off<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.979> couldn't<00:04:20.250> be<00:04:20.310> more

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
round and it's off it couldn't be more

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.220 
round and it's off it couldn't be more
simple

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.530 

so<00:04:25.230> moving<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.190> mold<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:27.300> have<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
so moving on to the mold you have the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.150 
so moving on to the mold you have the
small<00:04:27.780> mold<00:04:28.080> obviously<00:04:28.740> for<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.950> small

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
small mold obviously for the small

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.590 
small mold obviously for the small
method<00:04:29.490> feeders<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.210> have<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.420> large

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
method feeders and you have the large

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.960 
method feeders and you have the large
mold<00:04:30.930> for<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.230> large<00:04:31.440> method<00:04:31.770> feeders<00:04:32.130> now

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
mold for the large method feeders now

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.210 
mold for the large method feeders now
what's<00:04:33.240> unique<00:04:33.570> about<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.930> mold<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.530> that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
what's unique about this mold is that

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.180 
what's unique about this mold is that
it's<00:04:35.340> got<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.550> PU<00:04:36.180> coating<00:04:36.830> it's<00:04:37.830> got<00:04:37.980> an<00:04:38.040> inner

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
it's got a PU coating it's got an inner

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.890 
it's got a PU coating it's got an inner
skeleton<00:04:38.730> which<00:04:39.090> means<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.630> mold<00:04:39.810> is

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
skeleton which means that the mold is

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.240 
skeleton which means that the mold is
actually<00:04:39.990> solid<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.040> push<00:04:41.220> your

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
actually solid so when you push your

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.370 
actually solid so when you push your
feeder<00:04:41.610> into<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:42.360> not<00:04:42.570> moving<00:04:43.140> around

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
feeder into it it's not moving around

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.770 
feeder into it it's not moving around
obviously<00:04:44.160> causing<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.580> dis<00:04:45.000> formation<00:04:45.600> of

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
obviously causing the dis formation of

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.320 
obviously causing the dis formation of
your<00:04:45.990> actual<00:04:46.290> ground<00:04:46.620> bitter<00:04:46.890> on<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.040> feeder

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
your actual ground bitter on your feeder

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.760 
your actual ground bitter on your feeder
then<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.510> got<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.690> PU<00:04:49.020> courting<00:04:49.440> which<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.740> a

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
then it's got a PU courting which is a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.570 
then it's got a PU courting which is a
soft<00:04:50.160> sort<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.760> rubber<00:04:51.090> which<00:04:51.750> allows<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.680> the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
soft sort of rubber which allows the the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.120 
soft sort of rubber which allows the the
bit<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:54.240> basically<00:04:54.900> room<00:04:55.410> flea<00:04:55.620> remove<00:04:55.920> from

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
bit to basically room flea remove from

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.580 
bit to basically room flea remove from
the<00:04:56.220> feeder<00:04:56.600> it's<00:04:57.600> got<00:04:57.870> an<00:04:57.960> actually<00:04:58.380> non

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the feeder it's got an actually non

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.730 
the feeder it's got an actually non
slick<00:04:58.950> finish<00:04:59.810> which<00:05:00.810> means<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.500> when<00:05:01.650> you

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
slick finish which means that when you

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.830 
slick finish which means that when you
remove<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.220> actual<00:05:02.370> bit<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:03.270> doesn't<00:05:03.540> stick

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
remove the actual bit it doesn't stick

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.870 
remove the actual bit it doesn't stick
to<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.020> mold<00:05:04.470> at<00:05:04.620> all

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
to the mold at all

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840 
to the mold at all
we<00:05:06.510> tried<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.110> mold<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.850> when

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
we tried to do the mold so that when

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.190 
we tried to do the mold so that when
you're<00:05:09.000> actually<00:05:09.120> using<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.960> fits

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
you're actually using it it fits

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.780 
you're actually using it it fits
comfortably<00:05:10.410> with<00:05:10.830> your<00:05:10.860> hands<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.580> when<00:05:11.700> you

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
pellets wrong your feed without them

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.410 
pellets wrong your feed without them
sticking<00:05:29.070> into<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.490> bottom<00:05:29.730> of<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:29.910> mold<00:05:30.120> so

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
sticking into the bottom of the mold so

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.900 
sticking into the bottom of the mold so
I'll<00:05:31.290> demonstrate<00:05:31.500> exactly<00:05:31.980> how<00:05:32.340> easy<00:05:32.610> this

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
I'll demonstrate exactly how easy this

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.970 
I'll demonstrate exactly how easy this
is<00:05:32.970> with<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.330> new<00:05:33.750> mutt<00:05:33.930> one<00:05:34.140> so<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.710> get<00:05:34.830> your

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
is with a new mutt one so you get your

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.570 
is with a new mutt one so you get your
mold<00:05:35.480> scoop<00:05:36.480> you<00:05:36.630> bit<00:05:37.130> obviously<00:05:38.130> shake<00:05:38.370> off

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
mold scoop you bit obviously shake off

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.540 
mold scoop you bit obviously shake off
the<00:05:38.730> excess<00:05:39.380> push<00:05:40.380> your<00:05:40.560> feeder<00:05:40.800> in<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.280> hard

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
the excess push your feeder in as hard

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.380 
the excess push your feeder in as hard
as<00:05:41.670> you<00:05:41.790> can<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:44.010> remove<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:45.030> there<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.330> have

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
as you can and remove and there you have

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.240 
as you can and remove and there you have
it<00:05:45.540> perfectly<00:05:46.230> formed<00:05:46.620> around<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.890> method

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
it perfectly formed around the method

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.680 
it perfectly formed around the method
feeder<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.640> can<00:05:47.910> see<00:05:48.060> there's<00:05:48.240> no<00:05:48.360> birds

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
feeder you can see there's no birds

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.940 
feeder you can see there's no birds
around<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.080> edges<00:05:49.410> or<00:05:49.530> anything

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
around the edges or anything

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.610 
around the edges or anything
the<00:05:50.550> food's<00:05:50.940> all<00:05:51.180> compacted<00:05:51.840> round<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.380> which

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
the food's all compacted round it which

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.500 
the food's all compacted round it which
means<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.070> obviously<00:05:53.400> it's<00:05:53.520> really<00:05:53.550> compact

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
means that obviously it's really compact

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.090 
means that obviously it's really compact
when<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:54.900> cast<00:05:55.110> in<00:05:55.410> it's<00:05:55.560> not<00:05:55.680> going<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.890> fly
