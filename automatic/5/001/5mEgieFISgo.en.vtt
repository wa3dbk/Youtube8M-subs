00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
lot like last weekend had myself in a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.789

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.930 
get it done
kind<00:01:35.980> of<00:01:36.040> same<00:01:36.160> thing<00:01:36.310> at<00:01:36.400> night<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.790> know<00:01:36.850> I

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.310 
like mud but I think it kind of makes it
where<00:01:40.030> no<00:01:40.120> one's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.360> shoe<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.660> anything<00:01:41.200> can

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
make whenever you spill a little bit of

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.350 
make whenever you spill a little bit of
time<00:02:09.130> laying<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.610> ground<00:02:09.759> getting<00:02:10.300> your

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
time laying on the ground getting your
