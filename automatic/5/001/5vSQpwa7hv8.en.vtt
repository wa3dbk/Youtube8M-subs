do think it's a good game in my other
video<00:02:46.239> gears<00:02:47.140> were<00:02:47.260> three<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.430> beta<00:02:48.640> if<00:02:49.570> I

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
video gears were three the beta if I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.890 
video gears were three the beta if I
sound<00:02:50.109> stuffy<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:51.549> because<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.540> sinus

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
sound stuffy it's because I have a sinus

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.020 
sound stuffy it's because I have a sinus
infection<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.570> sucks<00:02:55.959> yeah

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
infection and that's it sucks yeah

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.460 
infection and that's it sucks yeah
it's<00:02:58.030> apparently<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.690> get<00:02:58.900> rid<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.170> sinus

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it's apparently to get rid of a sinus

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's apparently to get rid of a sinus
infection<00:02:59.560> they<00:03:00.010> have<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> give<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.609> four

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
infection they have to give you four

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.740 
infection they have to give you four
different<00:03:00.940> drugs<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:03.090> steroid<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.540> it's

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
different drugs and steroid so it's

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.370 
different drugs and steroid so it's
that's<00:03:05.140> great<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.739> know<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.750> balls<00:03:08.079> are

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
that's great you know this balls are

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.840 
that's great you know this balls are
shrinking<00:03:08.680> apparently<00:03:09.459> if<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.670> take

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
shrinking apparently if you take

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.430 
shrinking apparently if you take
steroids<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:12.579> otherwise<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.840> long<00:03:14.109> walk

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
steroids so otherwise it's a long walk

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.620 
steroids so otherwise it's a long walk
from<00:03:14.650> Charleston<00:03:15.310> from<00:03:16.000> Jamestown<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
