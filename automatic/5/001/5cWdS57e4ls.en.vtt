 hello from california to everyone 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 Subscribers all friends all so 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.359
 I want to tell today's video 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.640
 all that I came down the Ural mountains is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.310
 In general, for me, everything is amazing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 amazing and i wanna say this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 my channel and i like to speak only about 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 ourselves in the Urals are generally full 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 advanced youth people it's just 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.440
 like a video about me here I came to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 America I certainly alive in Russia 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 completely different life in general she is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 radically different from this but nonetheless 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 I was happy with everyone there 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 the problems that I had and I 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.219
 I already said I worked a lot 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 I had no time for anything 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.390
 here I also said that when I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000
 left the rivers correspond i slept on 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
 4 hours 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.619
 it happened on 3 and worked six days in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 week and so I didn't have at all 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.960
 time for that on some movies 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 tv series there i'm even at a birthday party there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 sometimes did not go because just 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 physically couldn't walk with friends like 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 would it be there well met over it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.299
 the birth of a specially arranged all sorts 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.360
 parties just because to us 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.790
 meet and so I am in such 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 whirlpool generally lived life to us that I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 I was getting to my bed there at the dacha 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 was given and filed without feelings and in the morning as 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 zombies got up to work in general like this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.360
 But I want to say that for me 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.630
 it was normal life, I kind of live and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 ok and here before 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:52.619
 go to america I did a movie 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:55.259
 which i bought ipad and in general i 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.329
 It advertised and turned out yesterday 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.610
 so rick bought me an iphone 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.219
 I'll even show you the video again. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.320
 revealing tell and flax and by the way 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.530
 I said thanks to the subscriber that here 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.970
 this thing is called flocked sticks 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 this, too, I already us 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 here in America though of course many 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.240
 people especially youth on long 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.450
 laugh but I don't care 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.050
 laugh I'm an average woman 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.900
 which worked its creator of life 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.160
 and many things I just didn't need in 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.810
 of that life, here I am advertising this tablet 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 just a few days ago 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.840
 yesterday we went with rick he bought me here 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.280
 this one here 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.920
 this is called a bar and this is a plank 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.370
 and here it is a bar in my understanding and 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 as it turned out that this one is aig from 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.340
 iphone is an analogue of ipad 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.620
 only a smaller size that 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.850
 for me, too, was amazing because 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.170
 as if I never did this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.940
 was interested and here, too, and films and all 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 it shows in this screen well 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.520
 Of course you less convenient because the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.040
 managed to 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.410
 but no less than the function at all exactly 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.200
 same I was shocked that on such 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.140
 Here you can watch there all that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.280
 you want around the world but earlier i still 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.500
 time I say I did not have time 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.950
 watch not a movie or TV series and even more 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.720
 youtube and classmates 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.320
 I generally want to do it as I do 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.880
 we bought this iphone 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.160
 our village gas Ural mountains 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.290
 went down to the american village here by 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 next buyer background 1 want to say that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.430
 I certainly did not understand there practically 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.670
 one word when there the river spoke 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.070
 with this with the manager or who they are there 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.110
 consultants generally do not go to 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.830
 Shop to us immediately approached 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.530
 consultant here with this aek ipad here 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.380
 all go with these and to the lady brought our 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.320
 data the river there recorded his phone and 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.390
 said what wait we sat there while the circle 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.470
 so they did a small shop 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.860
 and then there would be so well a bosom turn on 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.840
 the display shows that the rig is 5 minutes 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.239
 waited somewhere 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.470
 flashed the name we sat down for such 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.250
 a round table this manager came up 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.100
 the other is again with such a thing in 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.049
 general called rick his last name he 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.910
 opened there apparently all the data is stored 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.380
 they are not in these computers in general 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 family rates some 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.740
 and all him all the data said there on not about 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.730

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.140
 we all sat at this table there such 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.880
 how well barney history stools spent 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.940
 such a thing he did here 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.950
 This is how I spent my credit card. 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.550

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.310
 old phone there some kind of device with 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.440
 this table is a round table and inside is so 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.850
 the thing is done as a burial there 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.300
 all sorts of devices need to connect 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.540
 let's say iphone over here for energy yet 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.570
 what kind of delivery is there such as small 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.910
 cash register and dropped all the data 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.900
 from my old phone to my this one 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:22.310
 here's oh-oh-oh iphone is all this for him 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.140

 buy there they are ugly right now 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.930
 I'll go to another store and watch 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.560
 In general, all this is for him quite a bit 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.870
 time and everything they have so here it is 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.540
 computer zipcar detailed and the most 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.090
 the main thing is that when he brought himself in 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.280
 this vibe from and the consultant all the data 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.110
 all he gave the face but I already who do not 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.360
 the first time I can see it all 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.580
 this video is also about oh yes this one 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.650
 iPad Eric took and so here he is deprive 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.260
 lefty I already said this one 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.470
 finger that either you are thats your finger so here 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.020
 I picked up and put his signature here is 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.530
 Okay, I don't remember how 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.690
 finger 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.120
 okay, this beautiful looks like this 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.040
 here 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.560
 signed on this ipad and we left 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.300
 happy and satisfied 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.350
 By the way, I want to say to the people very much 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.510
 a lot but man probably 15 was a lot 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.400
 consultants I have already said that 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.940
 There are almost no queues in America 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.740
 if they are then they instantly 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.630
 new sellers are eliminated here 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.620
 is there this line 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.710
 deletes and here is exactly the same and all this 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.470
 I again seemed on the verge of fiction 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.570
 and in general, I came but I have already time 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.610
 The analogue of the iPad was in English 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.870
 so I'm pretty easy to have itself 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:47.870
 action did yesterday looked all in 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.000
 Overall of course cool and I'm glad that 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.070
 I have time now and some new ones 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.010
 things just find out this video looks 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.930
 my sister is there my friends but who I 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.480
 I know that they can not take out of pocket and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.710
 get out 20,000 let's go buy there 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:07.190
 this iphone here I watched it 4 5 here 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.860
 It costs in my 800 dollars if I do not 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.580
 cheating this one i don't know how much 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.130
 I think you can 400 dollars 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.320
 it is written that the tea is not made of californium 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.060
 something else is written to her 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.260
 but I already said that mini plants 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:26.780
 manufacturing made outside the United States here 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.450
 and all I wanted to say so I 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.380
 I will tell and things my impressions 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:36.260
 that's it a man who kind of was 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.040
 from this world so let's just say it to me 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.100
 didn't need 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.080
 so let's say I lived in another dimension 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.840
 Now I live in another dimension 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.270
 sharing impressions and so here's 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.840
 Video about this well all around until all 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.840
 Have a good mood
