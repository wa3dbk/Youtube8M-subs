00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
getting ready but I kind of was just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.780 
getting ready but I kind of was just
like<00:00:43.080> forget<00:00:43.380> it<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.130> want<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.540 
like forget it and you just want it and
start<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.200> while<00:00:46.920> figuring<00:00:47.370> out

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
start it and then I'm while figuring out

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.900 
start it and then I'm while figuring out
my<00:00:47.730> lipstick

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
my lipstick

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
my lipstick
a<00:00:51.350> different<00:00:52.350> tone<00:00:52.650> um<00:00:54.110> it's<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a different tone um it's kind of like a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.009 
a different tone um it's kind of like a
great<00:00:56.040> climate<00:00:56.730> tone<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.269> what<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> did<00:00:57.629> was

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
great climate tone so what I did was

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.549 
great climate tone so what I did was
just<00:00:58.230> mix<00:00:59.269> CoverGirl's

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
just mix CoverGirl's

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
just mix CoverGirl's

lipstick and I believe it's it's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.520 
lipstick and I believe it's it's
scratched<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.550> but<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.940> like<00:01:06.000> divine

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530
