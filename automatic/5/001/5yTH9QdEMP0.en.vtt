00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 people what is going on and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.030
 drive a new series 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.240
 Today I'll show you ten of them 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 worst games of all time and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.080
 Let's go one of the worst game 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 All times, for example, is great 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 for nintendo 64 from the year 1999 of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.779
 dieter software what others are playing 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 as a tutorial it works here main game 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.099
 already in the first levels you have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
 nothing else to do but through rings too 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 fly and that is through the and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 precise control and lousy camera 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.390
 almost impossible is the game 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 Of course also very well known by his 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 extremely ghastly graphic was 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 his peers so the game has 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 Overall, a rating of 34 from 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.579
 critics and 20 of gaming community sr 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.789
 arrived really well 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.219
 the next game is alien colonial 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.260
 marines from 2003 this game 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 This was over seven years in development 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 budget was getting smaller and still 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 Of course the game has to be as usual 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 a scheduled date ushers 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 result technically obsolete fuller 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 growth with boring mission and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.110
 Leveldesign critic tore, of course 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 the game on which the fans of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 alien 3 have been looking forward to for years 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.650
 nonetheless, the game has one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.030
 rating of 76 percent 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.470
 out of pity or batman forever appeared 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.560
 1995 and was the game to the same name 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 film by joel schumacher batman 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 by the way, this part of batman is valid 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 alongside batman and robin as one of the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.600
 the worst movies the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 play version of batmanforever sets 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 but still a dream are the mission 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 monotone the music shit and the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 Loading times are too long to interrupt 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.890
 sometimes even the game in the big and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.899
 Overall, it is thus a play what I call 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 child necessarily wish for christmas 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.869
 would not be the next game 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 to be known to some of you and indeed 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.189
 it is called duke nukem forever whole 15 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.200
 For years, the continuation of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 announced Jim's adventure and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 postponed again and announced to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.460
 then again understandably 2011 came out 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 and all fans disappointed outdated 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.959
 Graphics and precise control long 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.030
 Gameplay only thing the game still 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.800
 was reasonably bearable 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 the humor of duke that one has from him 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.840
 Although the game came like shit the game 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 did not run from the dancer 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.810
 the amateur developer but of one 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.129
 industry giant ubisoft the game came 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.170
 2001 for the playstation 1 and 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.569
 Playstation 2 on the market and was that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.030
 play too much with emily enders are the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.650
 wore the same name as ip what also 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.200
 always get the phoneeasy finished 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.569
 graphic retrograde sequences and corrosive 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.670
 quicktime event fights made that 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.590
 play to an unbearable trasch 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.220
 experience if I give these games 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.640
 Sascha to birthday have the game 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.830
 virtuoso joined the console in 1995 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.080
 free tv you come so yourself 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.810
 flopped namely because of the su and prices 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.610
 The whole cost is 700 dollars and is 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 today rather known for the high number 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.340
 bad curious against the very front with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.349
 The shooter will slip in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.569
 The skin of a rock star with long 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.459
 blond hair of the reason in the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.349
 virtual world escaped the game was 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.450
 but it is more socially critical 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.909
 embarrassing you fight in three 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.069
 short but unbelievable levels 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.959
 not only with countless enemies but 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.269
 also with really bad control 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.269
 and awful guitars soundtrack 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.490
 that sounds like fun the action movie 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.740
 Robocop was humorously humorized by a lot of blood 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.150
 socially critical impact on the classic 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.540
 unfortunately not like the eponymous one 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.190
 shooter implementation of 2003 no wonder 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.130
 stuck namely the famous 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.050
 notorious maker of superman 64 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.750
 behind which I told in the beginning 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.940
 rainer war always in the game 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.280
 partly sound effects and the voice 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.590
 acting should be and forgetful so 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.060
 was the game try or windows 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.680
 8 times that player from the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.140
 scare into the comments like that 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.090
 field makes none of you or that anyway 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.580
 next player is blackwater from fire 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.980
 with fire games tree two black water 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.350
 the favorite game of anton is it 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.670
 to be a private military company 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.070
 which due to its questionable 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.020
 meddling in the military conflict 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.540
 the whole world as highly controversial 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.580
 so it is just as questionable why 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.640
 Developer ever a game to this 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.740
 I ask the topic on the market 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.810
 me why he does that invasion 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.240
 Germany from the dutch developer 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.640
 The work is an ego-shooter from the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.530
 year 2000 some games are just 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.330
 bad some are so bad that they are 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.610
 again jokes are to the latter category 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.560
 also belongs invasion Germany in the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.690
 the game is about germany 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 aliens is attacked and you as 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.340
 player has to save the land and that does 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.770
 one at well-known sights like 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.300
 at the cologne cathedral or at the reichstag in 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.130
 berlin that probably in such 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.440
 bad graphics that the places even 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.850
 can not recognize 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.450
 the game has a rating of 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.710
 a total of 52 and the last game today 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.170
 is probably the best known 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.840
 easter egg the worst games of all 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.060
 times the talk is of course going 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.700
 For example, instead of you have as a player 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.010
 no idea what you are doing as et runs 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.600
 one through and recognizable environment and 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.640
 is dressed by men in black 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.290
 the yes only by a look in the 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.570
 game instructions do you have a chance 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.190
 to continue to play the game 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.080
 Developers only had a few weeks 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.000
 time to program because the game 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.150
 come out on time for christmas 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.250
 should end of 1982, it was finally 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.310
 as far as the play with it you live and 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.140
 became the biggest flop for a time of 5 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.850
 million produced game modules 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.040
 but millions were sold cold 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.380
 but there were some complaints 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.210
 so that in total about 80 percent of 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.070
 not at the end of the day 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.750
 sold where a majority of over 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.060
 remained games then in the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.850
 desert of new mexico was buried and was 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.620
 then someday 2014 wiederentdecker 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.510
 because there is a doku at 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.980
 netflix I think somewhere am 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.660
 for sure 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.640
 okay people that's it for today that was 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.800
 ten worst games of all time 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.660
 i hope that with the video if so 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.200
 then I forgot a thumb 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.910
 above 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.680
 to load and of course not forget 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.180
 think lite for free and subscribe 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.590
 We do not miss more videos 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.590
 See you again soon skin
