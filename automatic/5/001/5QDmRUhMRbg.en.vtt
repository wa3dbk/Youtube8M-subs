called<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.910> ultra<00:00:06.270> Renu<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.170> actually

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
called the ultra Renu this is actually

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.700 
called the ultra Renu this is actually
from<00:00:07.830> truth<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.309> aging<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.349> at-home<00:00:10.349> devices

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
from truth in aging and at-home devices

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.400 
from truth in aging and at-home devices
have<00:00:11.370> become<00:00:11.790> incredibly<00:00:12.360> powerful<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
have become incredibly powerful in the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.200 
have become incredibly powerful in the
last<00:00:13.590> few<00:00:13.830> years<00:00:13.860> these<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.460> scaled<00:00:14.849> down

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
last few years these are scaled down

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.349 
last few years these are scaled down
some<00:00:15.660> long<00:00:15.920> versions<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.210> use

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
some long versions and that you can use

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.760 
some long versions and that you can use
at<00:00:18.510> home<00:00:18.539> they're<00:00:18.990> safe<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.590> actually

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
at home they're safe and they actually

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.220 
at home they're safe and they actually
work<00:00:20.220> now<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> last<00:00:21.060> couple<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.570> years<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
work now for the last couple of years I

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.250 
work now for the last couple of years I
have<00:00:22.529> been<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.160> devotee<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.180> LED<00:00:24.720> light<00:00:24.990> therapy

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
have been a devotee of LED light therapy

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
have been a devotee of LED light therapy
it<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.160> works<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.640> boost<00:00:26.910> collagen<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it really works to boost collagen and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
it really works to boost collagen and
plump<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.230> skin<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.980> more<00:00:29.189> recently<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.730> found

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
plump the skin but more recently I found

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
plump the skin but more recently I found
that<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.510> ultrasonic<00:00:31.320> waves<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.890> well

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that there's ultrasonic waves as well

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
that there's ultrasonic waves as well
and<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.880> device<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.540> puts<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> two

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and this device actually puts the two

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.490 
and this device actually puts the two
together<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.760> really<00:00:36.120> neat<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
together and so it's really neat it can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
together and so it's really neat it can
be<00:00:37.590> used<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.040> easily<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
be used really easily and you just

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
be used really easily and you just
switch<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
switch it on and you use it in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
switch it on and you use it in the
ultrasonic<00:00:42.390> mode

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
ultrasonic mode

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
ultrasonic mode
it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.559> another<00:00:43.800> press<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> button<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's just another press of a button and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's just another press of a button and

favorite serum because the actual
ultrasonic<00:00:54.899> waves<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.410> help<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> product

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
ultrasonic waves will help the product

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
ultrasonic waves will help the product
penetrate<00:00:56.760> even<00:00:56.940> better<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.690> skin<00:00:58.140> and

antioxidant serum throughout the whole

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
antioxidant serum throughout the whole
thing<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.949> I'll<00:01:05.309> explain<00:01:05.640> white<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.119> we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thing and I'll explain white when we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
thing and I'll explain white when we
come<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> talk<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.020> LED<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.799> first

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
come on to talk about the LED but first

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
come on to talk about the LED but first
let's<00:01:08.340> talk<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> ultrasonic<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
let's talk about the ultrasonic and the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.250 
let's talk about the ultrasonic and the
ultrasonic<00:01:10.350> waves<00:01:11.060> really<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.330> help<00:01:12.750> lift<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
ultrasonic waves really do help lift and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.390 
ultrasonic waves really do help lift and
firm<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> probably<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> only

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
firm and this is probably the only

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
firm and this is probably the only
product<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> found<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.290> actually

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
product that I found which actually

gives you that great lifting effect

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
gives you that great lifting effect
around<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> jaw<00:01:19.170> area<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
around the kind of jaw area and what you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
around the kind of jaw area and what you
would<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.909> would<00:01:21.090> move<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.750> really

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
would do is you would move it really

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
would do is you would move it really
really<00:01:22.890> slowly<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.520> mean<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.210> your

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
really slowly I mean really take your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
really slowly I mean really take your
time<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.619> half<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> minute

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
time take you know up to half a minute

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.850 
time take you know up to half a minute
to<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.299> jaw<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> ear<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.710> then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to go from the jaw to the ear and then

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
to go from the jaw to the ear and then
you<00:01:28.950> would<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.280> every<00:01:29.820> section<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.930> upward

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you would do every section in upward

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
you would do every section in upward
movements<00:01:32.009> until<00:01:32.159> you've<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.759> whole

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
movements until you've got your whole

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630 
movements until you've got your whole
face<00:01:33.750> covered<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> forehead

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
face covered and you can do the forehead

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
face covered and you can do the forehead
and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> even<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.290> careful<00:01:37.560> about

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and you can even do you're careful about

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
and you can even do you're careful about
it<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> brow<00:01:38.670> bone<00:01:38.970> area<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.509> well<00:01:39.659> and

it do that brow bone area as well and
researchers<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:40.860> monitored<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
researchers have actually monitored this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.130 
researchers have actually monitored this
and<00:01:41.970> seen<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> two

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and seen that you can get a two

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
and seen that you can get a two
millimeter<00:01:43.860> lift<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.119> session

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
millimeter lift with just one session

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
millimeter lift with just one session
yeah<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.350> genuinely<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.310> notice

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
yeah so genuinely you will notice

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639 
yeah so genuinely you will notice
spending<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.390> four<00:01:48.810> minutes<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> face

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
spending about four minutes on the face

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.490 
spending about four minutes on the face
you'll<00:01:50.100> notice<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.670> real<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.390> real<00:01:51.500> discernible

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you'll notice a real a real discernible

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
you'll notice a real a real discernible
lift<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.189> obviously<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> keep<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
lift and obviously if you can keep this

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
lift and obviously if you can keep this
up<00:01:54.600> three<00:01:55.350> times<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.799> week<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> take

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
up three times a week it's going to take

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920 
up three times a week it's going to take
you<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:57.030> ten<00:01:57.390> minutes

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you about ten minutes

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.530 
you about ten minutes
to<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.170> both<00:01:58.380> LED<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.580> ultrasonic<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
to do both LED and the ultrasonic and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870 
to do both LED and the ultrasonic and
over<00:02:01.050> a<00:02:01.140> period<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.800> time<00:02:02.010> several<00:02:02.460> months

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
over a period of time several months

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
over a period of time several months
it's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.180> start<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.480> see<00:02:03.660> some<00:02:04.020> really

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
it's going to start to see some really

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's going to start to see some really
great<00:02:04.410> differences<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.160> your<00:02:05.310> face<00:02:05.550> now<00:02:06.060> let's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
great differences to your face now let's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.930 
great differences to your face now let's
look<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.720> LED<00:02:07.290> version<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.670> we'll<00:02:08.820> go

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
look at the the LED version so we'll go

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
look at the the LED version so we'll go
into<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.720> you've<00:02:10.170> got<00:02:10.350> three<00:02:10.890> lights

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
into that and you've got three lights

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.100 
into that and you've got three lights
here<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.360> panel<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.990> all

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
here all in one panel it's all

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.690 
here all in one panel it's all
integrated<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.980> don't<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> remove

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
integrated you don't have to remove

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090 
integrated you don't have to remove
anything<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.600> you've<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:15.900> blue<00:02:16.200> light<00:02:16.410> that's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
anything so you've got blue light that's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.580 
anything so you've got blue light that's
good<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.580> acne<00:02:17.940> breakouts<00:02:18.480> you've<00:02:19.080> got<00:02:19.290> green

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
good for acne breakouts you've got green

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.949 
good for acne breakouts you've got green
light<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.130> hyperpigmentation<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
light for hyperpigmentation and then the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.530 
light for hyperpigmentation and then the
red<00:02:22.200> light<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:22.980> wrinkles<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:24.390> would

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
red light is for wrinkles and you would

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.449 
red light is for wrinkles and you would
be<00:02:24.720> using<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.380> by<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.860> holding<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> just

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
be using this by just holding it just

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.640 
be using this by just holding it just
them<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.120> few<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.750> even<00:02:27.990> interesting<00:02:28.380> effect

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
them a few not even interesting effect

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
them a few not even interesting effect
if<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.860> meant<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.130> use<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.490> quite<00:02:29.760> close<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.270> as

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
if you meant to use it quite close up as

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.240 
if you meant to use it quite close up as
you<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:30.989> it's<00:02:31.470> probably<00:02:31.830> doing<00:02:32.130> about

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you can see it's probably doing about

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.490 
you can see it's probably doing about
half<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> face<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> time<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.170> move<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
half the face at a time you can move it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.550 
half the face at a time you can move it
around<00:02:34.610> carefully<00:02:35.610> slowly<00:02:36.330> working<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
around carefully slowly working on the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.130 
around carefully slowly working on the
areas<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.280> need<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.420> move<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
areas that you need to if you move up to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
areas that you need to if you move up to
the<00:02:40.260> eye<00:02:40.500> area<00:02:41.060> actually<00:02:42.060> LED<00:02:42.450> light<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.930> safe

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the eye area actually LED light is safe

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.560 
the eye area actually LED light is safe
but<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.680> good<00:02:43.950> idea<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.459> wear<00:02:44.880> goggles<00:02:45.180> which

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570

as a precaution and to protect the eyes
and<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:53.070> can<00:02:53.250> work<00:02:53.430> around<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.970> whole<00:02:54.150> area

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
and you can work around the whole area

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.420 
and you can work around the whole area
the<00:02:54.750> face<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.290> do<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> neck<00:02:56.100> and

the face you can do it on the neck and
it's<00:02:56.730> perfectly<00:02:57.239> safe<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.650> doesn't<00:02:59.489> get

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it's perfectly safe and it doesn't get

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240 
it's perfectly safe and it doesn't get
hot<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.209> actually<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> cool<00:03:00.930> device<00:03:01.380> that's
