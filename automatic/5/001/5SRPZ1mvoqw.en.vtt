 Hello everyone, furniture maker I am 6 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:12.179
 Guide for now let's start probably each of you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.529
 playing for the terrorists wanted to hide 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:22.230
 bomb so that the enemy did not find it 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'll show you where to hide her now 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.779
 no one will find after you 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:39.300
 hid b you need to go further 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:45.020
 haul round i bottom oblique well nothing all 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 equally he did not notice me -1 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 so how to replace again and border them all 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 scattered 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.989
 I did a fucking minus 7 on me 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.989
 ran out of space on the hard drive 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.700
 so france did not have time to capture this 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.699
 moment 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.369
 [music] 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.940
 after i cleaned the screw i went 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.150
 during on mutants having considered all 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.790
 possible options I decided that the most 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.820
 advantageous place to defend against mutants 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.000
 this is a cell because it can accommodate 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.170
 up to ten people did not interfere with each other and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 without failing 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:35.159
 textures again, well, you probably got caught 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.159
 everybody got into that little room again 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.820
 since there is no choice left 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:50.049
 go to that prick 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.049
 [music] 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.020
 bay fucking i'm a hero well i'm all 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.130
 Pharma is no end 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.710
 [music] 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.069
 Someone says that I ate plagiarism 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.340
 using for every voice as he fucking 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.510
 that's all because I can talk like that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 voice can 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.959
 and even in such a voice of their English 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.040
 accent 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.800
 less is not played and the end of a disaster 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.720
 now and then I am a robot 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.290

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.230

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.230
