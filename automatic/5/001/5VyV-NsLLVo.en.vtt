 unexpected mind 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.540

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 trapped in another dimension and you think 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.540

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.190
 motorcyclists while they are separated 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.690

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.610
 truly perfect and we want 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.070

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.030
 from a movie

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.569

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 to the windows arms but they fell in 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.450
 our arms and they fell in love with 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.420
