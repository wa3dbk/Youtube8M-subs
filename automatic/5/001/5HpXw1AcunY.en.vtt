 ah 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 place the line on the spool port and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 fits the entrepreneur passes the line 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.440
 guides and the or items in the direction 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.989
 indicated in the cross machine cover 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 end of the thread in the bore of the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.210
 inside out 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 then place the bobbin in the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.720
 coil and push right 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.000
 hold the end of the line and step on the pedal 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.130
 controller for coil fill to stop 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 to cut the line and continue the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.309
 The process includes the coil and I 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.680
 left side 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.259
 cutting the line and make the coil turns 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.470
 steering wheel toward you for the woman 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.420
 stay in the highest position on the machines 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.180
 with the horizontal coil system 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 place the bobbin in the box 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.520
 below the woman so that the coil 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.590
 counter-clockwise and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 line by the two readings 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.040
 close the bobbin case with the display 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.890
 machines with vertical coil system 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.229
 remove the extension from the base and open the cover 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.259
 remove the bobbin case by holding the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.960
 lock coil fits into coil housing 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.439
 against the line through the slot and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.689
 under the bobbin case spring let 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.540
 about 10 centimeters of line for 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.540
 out of the bobbin case place the carton 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.390
 of the shuttle coil fit the pin on the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.590
 center of the shuttle slot and tighten 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.590
 until you hear a click 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.869
 lift the shoe lever and turn the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.630
 steering wheel toward you until the needle 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.300
 stay in its highest position 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.030
 place the line on the spool pin and 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.030
 fits the reel entrepreneur pass 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 the line in the guides rivers and tensioner following 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.520
 indication of the arrows on the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.520
 machine 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.780
 so the line in the last wire guide above 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.269
 of the needle 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 the low sneaker passes the line on the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.490
 future of the needle 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.400
 raise the shoe 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.380
 the tea line from below turning the steering wheel 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.670
 towards you 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.950
 bush then the two lines back to 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.790
 the machines that have the drawstring 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.160
 on the needle 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.370
 raise the needle in its most 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.070
 down the line dowel slowly and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.560
 fit line on hook light line 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.020
 forward of the needle until you feel 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.420
 line hooked hold line 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.290
 gently, and then release the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 slowly 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.840
 the goose will go through the needle hole 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.620
 leading the loop-shaped line to 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:27.050
 behind draws this tie attention of the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.600
 according to the thickness of the line and 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.110
 tissue as thicker lines and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.500
 greater attention should the point be 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.530
 in the fabric increases the voltage if the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.950
 point is pulling fabric decrease 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.950
 attention 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 in electronic machines 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.660
 the points are easy to select is enough 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.030
 pressing the desired point key or 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.670
 to choose the point number in a table 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.730
 both compliance and width of the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.310
 points are already automatically suggested 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.400
 and can be changed according to your 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.740
 need in mechanical 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.010
 selection of points is made per day more 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.230
 voters to select them just spin 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.660
 of different albums modes 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 in this case the length adjustment and 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 width of points is made through this 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.880
 voter is 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.880
 depending on the model of your machine 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.750
 to remove the shoe lift off the 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.660
 sneaker and tighten lever 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.840
 that way it will come loose to fit 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.300
 the shoe will position it under the stem 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 and the low lever so that the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.340
 cradle support 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.950
 on this other system press the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.950
 shoe up until it loosens 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.180
 exchange this sharing 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.040
 from the room to the sash and press 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.040
 the screw until it clicks 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.520
 with needle in the highest position, release the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.460
 screw with a screwdriver 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.889
 remove the needle place the flat side of the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.840
 new needle back and push 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.539
 up as much as possible 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.419
 tighten and tighten the 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.190
 needle 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.470
 there is one needle for each type of 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.810
 fabric and application in the 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.569
 instructions you will find a table 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.389
 with needle choice guidelines 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.430
 and its proper use is 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.419
 very important for the final result 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.000
 of work 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.599
 following this space your machine will be 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.190
 ready for sewing now just use your 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.190
 talent and start creating
