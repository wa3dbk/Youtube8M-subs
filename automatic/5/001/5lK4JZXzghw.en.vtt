gem and then I have a really really
cheap<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.600> don't<00:04:54.600> know<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> marvi<00:04:56.240> half

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
cheap I don't know this is a marvi half

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.020 
cheap I don't know this is a marvi half
inch<00:04:57.570> circle<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.680> just<00:04:58.980> cut<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.340> out<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.790> I

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
inch circle and I just cut it out and I

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.360 
inch circle and I just cut it out and I
raised<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.660> on<00:05:00.980> foam<00:05:01.980> tape<00:05:02.400> also<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:04.370> I'm

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
raised that on foam tape also and I'm

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
raised that on foam tape also and I'm
just<00:05:05.640> going<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.970> add<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:08.700> center<00:05:09.180> of

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
just going to add that in the center of

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.340 
just going to add that in the center of
that<00:05:09.650> snowflake<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:12.150> think<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.870> turned<00:05:13.200> out

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
that snowflake and I think it turned out

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.640 
that snowflake and I think it turned out
