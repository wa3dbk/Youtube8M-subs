00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
so now to get into this I assume this is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.150 
so now to get into this I assume this is
the<00:03:35.930> same<00:03:36.200> way<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.440> have<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.620> open<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.920> up<00:03:37.010> like

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the same way you have to open it up like

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.560 
the same way you have to open it up like
the<00:03:37.310> iPod<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.959> take<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.500> here<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
the iPod so you take this here like a

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.509 
the iPod so you take this here like a
iPod<00:03:41.900> Touches<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.650> stuff<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:43.100> always<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
iPod Touches and stuff I always have to

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.199 
iPod Touches and stuff I always have to
do<00:03:43.640> this<00:03:43.760> with<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.110> pulled<00:03:45.530> us<00:03:45.650> off<00:03:45.830> here

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
do this with so you pulled us off here

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.440 
do this with so you pulled us off here
and<00:03:51.370> should<00:03:52.370> just<00:03:52.519> go<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.670> take<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.000> out<00:03:53.180> I

I'm not going to take that off unless
there's<00:03:58.670> another<00:03:58.730> way<00:03:59.170> but<00:04:00.170> right<00:04:00.500> now<00:04:00.709> it

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
there's another way but right now it

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.750 
there's another way but right now it
seems<00:04:01.160> debris<00:04:01.549> was<00:04:03.250> seems<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.400> be<00:04:04.519> is<00:04:04.610> this

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
seems debris was seems to be is this

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.960 
seems debris was seems to be is this
they<00:04:05.239> put<00:04:05.450> new<00:04:05.600> stuff<00:04:05.870> into<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.730> because<00:04:07.730> the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
they put new stuff into it because the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.800 
they put new stuff into it because the
sony<00:04:08.209> logo<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.750> not<00:04:08.870> here<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:10.180> don't<00:04:11.180> know<00:04:11.600> if

that's supposed to be going on the PSP
Logan's<00:04:13.820> go<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.350> I'm<00:04:15.350> gonna<00:04:15.709> assume<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.160> they

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
Logan's go on I'm gonna assume that they

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.680 
Logan's go on I'm gonna assume that they
put<00:04:16.519> new<00:04:16.640> casing<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.799> which<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:19.010> my<00:04:19.190> best<00:04:19.690> way

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
put new casing on which is my best way

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
put new casing on which is my best way
to<00:04:20.720> understand<00:04:21.260> this<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.729> think<00:04:22.729> that's<00:04:23.210> what

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
to understand this I think that's what

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.290 
to understand this I think that's what
they<00:04:23.419> did<00:04:23.650> now<00:04:24.650> I'm<00:04:25.550> gonna<00:04:25.760> open<00:04:25.849> up<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.150> back

of<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.740> yeah<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.919> seems<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.430> be<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.640> same

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
of this yeah that seems to be the same

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.149 
of this yeah that seems to be the same
I'm<00:04:30.139> gonna<00:04:30.259> put<00:04:30.409> the<00:04:30.470> battery<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.919> really

I<00:05:31.960> don't<00:05:32.960> like<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.199> fact<00:05:33.409> that<00:05:33.740> they<00:05:34.159> got<00:05:34.819> rid

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
I don't like the fact that they got rid

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.629 
I don't like the fact that they got rid
of<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.750> logos<00:05:36.139> because<00:05:36.889> that<00:05:37.129> kind<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.370> takes

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
of the logos because that kind of takes

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.180 
of the logos because that kind of takes
away<00:05:37.849> from<00:05:37.879> it<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.590> guess<00:05:39.889> if<00:05:39.979> you're<00:05:40.039> going

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
away from it so I guess if you're going

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.010 
away from it so I guess if you're going
to<00:05:40.250> sell<00:05:40.370> this<00:05:40.460> online<00:05:40.849> it<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.360> at<00:05:41.539> any<00:05:41.870> point

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
to sell this online it is at any point

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.050 
to sell this online it is at any point
in<00:05:42.349> time<00:05:42.430> you're<00:05:43.430> going<00:05:43.520> to<00:05:43.610> have<00:05:43.759> to<00:05:43.879> tell

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
in time you're going to have to tell

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.390 
in time you're going to have to tell
them<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.870> was<00:05:45.080> refurbished<00:05:45.589> by<00:05:45.710> gamestop<00:05:46.039> or

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
them this was refurbished by gamestop or

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.309 
them this was refurbished by gamestop or
I<00:05:46.669> don't<00:05:47.120> think<00:05:47.360> you'd<00:05:47.449> have<00:05:47.539> to<00:05:47.659> say<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:47.839> but

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
I don't think you'd have to say that but

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.540 
I don't think you'd have to say that but
just<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.589> fact<00:05:48.770> that<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.949> logos<00:05:49.279> are<00:05:49.430> gone

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
just the fact that the logos are gone

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.579 
just the fact that the logos are gone
and<00:05:49.759> they<00:05:50.180> put<00:05:50.360> their<00:05:50.509> new<00:05:50.810> housing<00:05:51.229> on<00:05:51.379> this

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
and they put their new housing on this

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.269 
and they put their new housing on this
which<00:05:52.279> would<00:05:52.430> not<00:05:52.580> be<00:05:52.819> a<00:05:53.150> bad<00:05:53.479> thing<00:05:53.509> but<00:05:54.279> it

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
which would not be a bad thing but it

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.040 
which would not be a bad thing but it
kind<00:05:55.669> of<00:05:55.819> takes<00:05:56.029> away<00:05:56.300> from<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.629> effect<00:05:56.960> that

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
kind of takes away from the effect that

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.600 
kind of takes away from the effect that
original<00:05:57.800> ones<00:05:57.979> had<00:05:58.690> so<00:05:59.690> I<00:06:00.370> hope<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.460> liked

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
original ones had so I hope you liked

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.129 
original ones had so I hope you liked
the<00:06:01.759> new<00:06:01.789> style<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.210> unboxing<00:06:02.690> that<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:02.930> set<00:06:03.110> up

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
the new style of unboxing that I set up

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.110 
the new style of unboxing that I set up

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
here it's a little bit less shaky from

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.600 
here it's a little bit less shaky from
the<00:06:05.210> old<00:06:05.360> ones<00:06:05.569> and<00:06:05.990> I<00:06:06.680> thought<00:06:07.339> it<00:06:07.490> was<00:06:07.550> a

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
the old ones and I thought it was a

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.730 
the old ones and I thought it was a
little<00:06:07.879> bit<00:06:07.969> more<00:06:08.120> thorough<00:06:08.509> than<00:06:08.900> my<00:06:09.469> older

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
little bit more thorough than my older

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.070 
little bit more thorough than my older
ones<00:06:09.979> here<00:06:10.219> so<00:06:11.210> if<00:06:11.300> you<00:06:11.389> like<00:06:11.539> these<00:06:11.690> videos
