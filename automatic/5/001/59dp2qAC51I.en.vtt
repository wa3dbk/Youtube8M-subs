00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
is I'm just going to run through them

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.369 
is I'm just going to run through them
really<00:00:44.239> quickly<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.660> won't<00:00:44.839> go<00:00:44.989> into<00:00:45.109> all<00:00:45.289> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
really quickly I won't go into all the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.200 
really quickly I won't go into all the
features<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:45.890> I'll<00:00:46.309> show<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:46.730> that<00:00:46.940> what

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
features but I'll show what that what

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.819 
features but I'll show what that what
the<00:00:47.300> different<00:00:47.600> sound<00:00:47.960> capabilities<00:00:48.649> are<00:00:48.800> and

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
the different sound capabilities are and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.040 
the different sound capabilities are and
you<00:00:49.190> can<00:00:49.370> compare<00:00:49.730> them<00:00:49.909> based<00:00:50.629> on<00:00:50.780> what<00:00:50.960> you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
you can compare them based on what you

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.079 
you can compare them based on what you
hear<00:00:51.350> from<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.649> microphone<00:00:52.070> I'm<00:00:52.339> now<00:00:52.730> granted

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
hear from the microphone I'm now granted

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.369 
hear from the microphone I'm now granted
that's<00:00:53.269> not<00:00:53.510> going<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.719> give<00:00:53.839> you<00:00:53.929> a<00:00:54.019> real

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
that's not going to give you a real

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.809 
that's not going to give you a real
accurate<00:00:54.769> representation<00:00:55.429> you<00:00:55.519> really<00:00:55.699> need

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
accurate representation you really need

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.399 
accurate representation you really need
to<00:00:55.909> hear<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.179> in<00:00:56.239> person<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.260> nice<00:00:57.379> thing

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
to hear it in person but the nice thing

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.500 
to hear it in person but the nice thing
about<00:00:57.649> this<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.069> all<00:00:58.249> these<00:00:58.460> sound<00:00:58.670> cards<00:00:58.940> with

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
about this is all these sound cards with

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.239 
about this is all these sound cards with
the<00:00:59.629> exception<00:01:00.019> of<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.199> crystal<00:01:00.530> focus<00:01:00.829> are

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
the exception of the crystal focus are

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.669 
the exception of the crystal focus are
installed<00:01:01.760> almost<00:01:02.149> exactly<00:01:03.109> in<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> same

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
installed almost exactly in the same

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.770 
installed almost exactly in the same
saber<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.309> ascend<00:01:04.610> saber<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.510> there's<00:01:05.660> going

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
saber the ascend saber so there's going

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.900 
saber the ascend saber so there's going
to<00:01:05.840> be<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.990> lot<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.380> parallels<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.310> lot<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.610> it'll

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
to be a lot of parallels a lot of it'll

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.610 
to be a lot of parallels a lot of it'll
be<00:01:08.000> easy<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.270> distinguish<00:01:08.810> any<00:01:09.050> differences

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
be easy to distinguish any differences

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.670 
be easy to distinguish any differences
so<00:01:10.220> I'm<00:01:10.280> going<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.430> start<00:01:10.640> with<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.410> new<00:01:12.410> nano

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
so I'm going to start with the new nano

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.740 
so I'm going to start with the new nano
biscotti<00:01:13.130> sound<00:01:13.430> card<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:14.330> course<00:01:14.510> I'm<00:01:14.630> just

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
biscotti sound card of course I'm just

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.850 
biscotti sound card of course I'm just
booting<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.170> up<00:01:15.290> because<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.530> was<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.740> deep

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
booting it up because it was in deep

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.740 
booting it up because it was in deep
sleep<00:01:16.100> mode<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.240> this<00:01:17.540> is<00:01:17.660> my

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
sleep mode so this is the this is my

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
sleep mode so this is the this is my

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
vader OT font in all of these this is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.539 
vader OT font in all of these this is
the<00:01:20.390> nano<00:01:20.570> biscotti

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.510
