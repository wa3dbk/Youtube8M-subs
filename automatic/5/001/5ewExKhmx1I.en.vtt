00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.310
 doom the most optimal thing we have at this moment 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.030
 because it allows us to meet the emergency demand in the toast over time 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.959
 real 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.219
 dogi before the proximity of a situation of this kind immediately 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.279
 the military who come 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.539
 for the moment we are only working with Jesus 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.630
 all eyes 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.689
 they have activated the alarm 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.089
 they are not compartments 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.910
 perhaps a chemical legend 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 By type of road that is missing the signature others 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 if you look at it 50 48 h 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.390
 together and a loud alarm began to sound 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.680
 don cease endemol alarming therefore 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.620
 finally we do 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130
 the 50 40 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.059
 and not give immediately I saw them exact passion of where 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 is at this moment 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.650
 later we go 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.870
 for belgium 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.870
 is in san luis al hilo on the internet 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.430
 located with a network 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.370
 from that position 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.320
 Exact activists encounter happened to the Andalusians 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 it tells us that it is 18 meters away 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.560
 the PRIistas to past have seen 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 nothing we communicate to the prostate with six strokes on a pair of tears 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.390
 for 15 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.200
 not my love this point of bidding what is the reason 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 for which the alarm has sounded 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.340
 with this last system 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.150
 the subject quite alarm but 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
 once or twice a day 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.930
 as for example not for parking more than 10 thousand 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 Finally 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.060
 the tickets is still active 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 and here where they are monitored and required to comply with safety regulations 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820
 something that I commented 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.990
 what it says 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.909
 one that needs to be proposed a week bayly minutes on the road 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.310
 because for us it is an omen of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.740
 bilbo- 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.710
 something like that and you have to play except for some damage in those areas alliances 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.499
 strategies that we want to do with companies 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.499
 to install this system this is a gps system 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 it is a living system and tourism and safety 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.399
 God want that in the future 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 companies can adjust costs this system 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.139
 indicated that a podium where he will be much more efficient said that while the 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 year 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.529
 then repeat that the phone call that we received from the public 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.609
 immediately they are operated under the same system they communicated nearer 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.059
 and there is a reduction last year a reduction of about 30 percent of 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.319
 the assaults on roads tried to run this year 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.209
 keep reducing the number of assaults
