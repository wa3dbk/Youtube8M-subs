drum and tapping around the lugs and you
can<00:01:19.619> hear<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> slight<00:01:20.070> pitch<00:01:20.310> differences

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
can hear a slight pitch differences

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
can hear a slight pitch differences
which<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> gonna<00:01:21.900> indicate<00:01:22.110> different

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
which is gonna indicate different

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.109 
which is gonna indicate different
tensions<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.310> ideas<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> try<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> get

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
tensions and ideas I want to try to get

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.970 
tensions and ideas I want to try to get
those<00:01:24.270> pitches<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.200> equal<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> can

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
syllable blow to lower pitch I'm gonna

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.420 
syllable blow to lower pitch I'm gonna
bring<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.830> little<00:01:39.950> bit<00:01:40.070> more<00:01:40.250> when<00:01:40.400> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.820 
started doing quarter turns now so now
we<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.030> head<00:01:44.450> fairly<00:01:44.690> fairly<00:01:45.620> too

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
we have the head fairly fairly too

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.150 
we have the head fairly fairly too
evenly<00:01:46.130> tensioned<00:01:46.720> I'm<00:01:47.720> gonna<00:01:47.900> take<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.380> little

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160

old-school technique I'll dab the drum

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.330 
old-school technique I'll dab the drum
and<00:01:56.900> I<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.200> do<00:01:57.290> with<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.620> is<00:01:57.800> I<00:01:57.890> take<00:01:58.280> a

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
and I like to do with this is I take a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.580 
and I like to do with this is I take a
piece<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.880> then<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.690> put<00:01:59.869> a<00:01:59.900> little<00:02:00.080> fold<00:02:00.380> in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
piece and then I put a little fold in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.310 
piece and then I put a little fold in
the<00:02:00.680> middle<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:01.940> little<00:02:02.119> flap<00:02:02.420> gives<00:02:03.110> me

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
the middle and this little flap gives me

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.830 
the middle and this little flap gives me
some<00:02:03.979> mass<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.820> absorb<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> vibrations<00:02:05.750> from

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
some mass to absorb the vibrations from

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.180 
some mass to absorb the vibrations from
the<00:02:06.080> drum<00:02:06.260> head<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.590> usually<00:02:06.800> start<00:02:07.010> with

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
the drum head and I usually start with

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.609 
the drum head and I usually start with
one<00:02:07.340> piece<00:02:07.550> off<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> side<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.410> tap

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
one piece off to the side and then I tap

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.010 
one piece off to the side and then I tap
the<00:02:09.800> drum<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.070> see<00:02:10.250> how<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.850> control<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:14.020> so

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the drum to see how the control is so

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.630 
the drum to see how the control is so
getting<00:02:15.680> better<00:02:15.890> still<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.550> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
getting better still a little bit of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.430 
getting better still a little bit of
ring<00:02:16.790> happening<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.990> take

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
ring happening so I'm going to take

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.790 
ring happening so I'm going to take
another<00:02:18.560> piece<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.160> same<00:02:19.370> thing<00:02:23.800> so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
another piece and do the same thing so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.380 
another piece and do the same thing so

called<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.920> tension<00:02:49.130> watch<00:02:49.430> there's<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
called the tension watch there's a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.580 
called the tension watch there's a
couple<00:02:50.330> different<00:02:50.450> manufacturers<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.470> make

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
couple different manufacturers that make

basically what these things do is they

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.810 
basically what these things do is they
measure<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.739> surface<00:02:57.920> tension<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.640> head

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
measure the surface tension of the head

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.180 
measure the surface tension of the head
I'll<00:02:59.420> allow<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.930> get<00:03:00.049> uniform<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.769> tension

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
I'll allow you to get uniform on tension

I'll allow you to get uniform on tension
across<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.700> head<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.090> going<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.269> help

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
across the head which is going to help

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.180 
across the head which is going to help
it<00:03:02.510> resonate<00:03:02.900> better<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.799> I'm<00:03:03.860> going<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.040> start

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
it resonate better so I'm going to start

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.890 
it resonate better so I'm going to start
with<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.370> bottom<00:03:04.519> resonant<00:03:05.090> head<00:03:05.120> first<00:03:05.540> all

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
with the bottom resonant head first all

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.830 
with the bottom resonant head first all
them<00:03:06.290> again<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.280> loosen<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> lugs<00:03:07.970> if

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
them again I like to loosen the lugs if

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.380 
them again I like to loosen the lugs if
the<00:03:08.989> drum<00:03:09.170> heads<00:03:09.350> are<00:03:09.530> newer<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:11.000> might<00:03:11.180> want

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.860 
it seems to be seems to be too low of a
pitch<00:06:36.160> then<00:06:36.400> off<00:06:36.550> I'll<00:06:37.120> work<00:06:37.390> it<00:06:37.540> up<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.780> little

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
the pitch and then I'll go through and

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:54.050
