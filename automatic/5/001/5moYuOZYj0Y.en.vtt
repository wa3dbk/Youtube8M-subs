00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inside here are a set of instructions

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
inside here are a set of instructions
which<00:01:01.649> again<00:01:02.250> talk<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
which again talk about how to put the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.460 
which again talk about how to put the
case<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> change<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.119> EMW<00:01:06.810> element

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
case on how to change that EMW element

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.310 
case on how to change that EMW element
and<00:01:07.590> basically<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> whole<00:01:09.180> process

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and basically how the whole process

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.609 
and basically how the whole process
works

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
works

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.810 
works
so<00:01:11.460> let<00:01:11.729> me<00:01:11.760> first<00:01:12.270> snap<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.229> iPhone<00:01:13.650> 5<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.610> here

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so let me first snap my iPhone 5 in here

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
so let me first snap my iPhone 5 in here
essentially<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> heavy

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
essentially what this is is like a heavy

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.749 
essentially what this is is like a heavy
duty<00:01:17.240> soft<00:01:18.240> touch<00:01:18.509> TPU<00:01:19.080> case<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.520> piece

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
duty soft touch TPU case it's one piece

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.179 
duty soft touch TPU case it's one piece
as<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
as you can see and you just put it on

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
as you can see and you just put it on
kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> snap<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
kind of like you would a snap on the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
kind of like you would a snap on the
back<00:01:24.960> style<00:01:25.200> case<00:01:25.530> starting<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> button

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
back style case starting with the button

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
back style case starting with the button
side<00:01:27.060> first<00:01:27.420> though<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
side first though and then going to the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
side first though and then going to the
bottom<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.329> fully

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bottom like that and then it's fully

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.080 
bottom like that and then it's fully
installed<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.740> before<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.369> whether

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
installed so before we get into whether

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
installed so before we get into whether
this<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.540> works<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.100> relates<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this case works or not as it relates to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
this case works or not as it relates to

raising<00:02:49.219> this<00:02:49.370> antenna<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.959> ran<00:02:51.409> a<00:02:51.439> bunch<00:02:51.799> of

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:51.949 
raising this antenna so I ran a bunch of

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.970 
raising this antenna so I ran a bunch of
speed<00:02:52.280> tests<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.599> those<00:02:53.900> are<00:02:54.109> all<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
runaround tech review which hopefully

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.140 
runaround tech review which hopefully
you'll<00:02:57.560> click<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:57.919> annotation<00:02:58.099> link<00:02:58.909> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
you'll click that annotation link and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.240 
you'll click that annotation link and
check<00:02:59.329> out<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.780> can<00:03:00.439> do<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.739> here<00:03:00.949> but<00:03:01.129> as<00:03:01.219> you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
check out I can do one here but as you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.490 
check out I can do one here but as you
can<00:03:01.400> see<00:03:01.489> I'm<00:03:01.730> getting<00:03:01.879> full<00:03:02.269> reception<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:02.989> we

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
can see I'm getting full reception so we

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.110 
can see I'm getting full reception so we
probably<00:03:03.680> won't<00:03:03.949> see<00:03:04.219> much<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.699> change<00:03:04.939> but

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
probably won't see much of a change but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240 
probably won't see much of a change but
basically<00:03:05.629> what<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.810> found<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.590> that's<00:03:07.010> first

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
basically what I found and that's first

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.000 
basically what I found and that's first
run<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.549> speed<00:03:07.909> test<00:03:08.090> without<00:03:08.419> the<00:03:08.900> antenna<00:03:09.799> up

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
run a speed test without the antenna up

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.399 
run a speed test without the antenna up
basically<00:03:10.790> what<00:03:10.909> I<00:03:10.939> found<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.449> in<00:03:11.659> areas<00:03:12.169> where

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
basically what I found is in areas where

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.369 
basically what I found is in areas where
Wi-Fi<00:03:13.400> was<00:03:13.669> weak<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.689> areas<00:03:15.019> where<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.230> was

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
Wi-Fi was weak so in areas where I was

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.929 
Wi-Fi was weak so in areas where I was
getting<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:15.739> one<00:03:16.129> bar<00:03:16.459> or<00:03:16.790> maybe<00:03:17.030> two<00:03:17.919> this

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
getting like one bar or maybe two this

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.270 
getting like one bar or maybe two this
case<00:03:19.939> would<00:03:20.359> boost<00:03:20.629> me<00:03:20.900> up<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.470> two<00:03:22.099> to<00:03:22.250> three

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
case would boost me up to two to three

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.550 
case would boost me up to two to three
bars<00:03:22.759> and<00:03:23.090> there<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.269> can<00:03:23.419> see<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.569> got<00:03:23.720> 44<00:03:24.379> over

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
bars and there you can see I got 44 over

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.499 
bars and there you can see I got 44 over
20<00:03:25.009> I<00:03:25.189> don't<00:03:25.609> know<00:03:25.669> how<00:03:25.790> much<00:03:25.939> better<00:03:26.150> I'll<00:03:26.329> do

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:26.509 
20 I don't know how much better I'll do

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.420 
20 I don't know how much better I'll do
with<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:26.780> antenna<00:03:27.109> up<00:03:27.290> honestly<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.069> have

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
with the antenna up honestly I have

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.699 
with the antenna up honestly I have
pretty<00:03:28.639> good<00:03:28.729> Wi-Fi<00:03:29.269> speeds<00:03:29.569> at<00:03:29.720> home<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.530> as

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
pretty good Wi-Fi speeds at home but as

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.199 
pretty good Wi-Fi speeds at home but as
I<00:03:30.949> was<00:03:31.099> saying<00:03:31.310> when<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.519> was<00:03:31.699> in<00:03:31.790> an<00:03:31.879> area<00:03:32.150> that

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
I was saying when I was in an area that

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.020 
I was saying when I was in an area that
had<00:03:32.449> weak<00:03:32.840> Wi-Fi<00:03:33.560> reception<00:03:33.919> this<00:03:34.699> did<00:03:34.970> a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
had weak Wi-Fi reception this did a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.869 
had weak Wi-Fi reception this did a
great<00:03:35.389> job<00:03:35.419> at<00:03:35.959> boosting<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.769> up<00:03:36.979> to<00:03:37.250> 2<00:03:37.489> or<00:03:37.519> 3

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
great job at boosting that up to 2 or 3

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.210 
great job at boosting that up to 2 or 3
bars<00:03:38.120> in<00:03:38.449> the<00:03:38.900> areas<00:03:39.229> where<00:03:39.259> I<00:03:39.470> got<00:03:39.709> very<00:03:40.129> good

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
bars in the areas where I got very good

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.849 
bars in the areas where I got very good
Wi-Fi<00:03:41.000> reception<00:03:41.359> like<00:03:42.169> where<00:03:42.379> I<00:03:42.409> am<00:03:42.500> right

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
Wi-Fi reception like where I am right

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.119 
Wi-Fi reception like where I am right
now

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
now

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.249 
now
I<00:03:43.489> didn't<00:03:44.000> notice<00:03:44.239> much<00:03:44.419> of<00:03:44.479> a<00:03:44.659> change<00:03:44.959> at<00:03:45.229> all

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
I didn't notice much of a change at all

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.439 
I didn't notice much of a change at all
so<00:03:45.829> let's<00:03:46.009> do<00:03:46.189> another<00:03:46.310> chain<00:03:46.759> a<00:03:46.790> test<00:03:47.209> and

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
so let's do another chain a test and

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.689 
so let's do another chain a test and
seeing<00:03:47.689> in<00:03:48.470> some<00:03:48.739> instances<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.430> here's<00:03:49.609> a

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
seeing in some instances and here's a

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.849 
seeing in some instances and here's a
great<00:03:49.879> example<00:03:49.909> the<00:03:50.840> reception<00:03:51.349> was<00:03:51.470> actually

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
great example the reception was actually

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.219 
great example the reception was actually
worse<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:52.729> there<00:03:53.389> you<00:03:53.509> can<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.689> with<00:03:54.079> the

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
worse so there you can see with the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.839 
worse so there you can see with the
antenna<00:03:54.620> down

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
antenna down

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.619 
antenna down
I<00:03:55.879> got<00:03:56.269> 44<00:03:56.930> over<00:03:57.349> 20<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.250> with<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.579> up<00:03:58.759> I<00:03:58.879> got<00:03:59.120> 39

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
I got 44 over 20 and with it up I got 39

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.920 
I got 44 over 20 and with it up I got 39
over<00:03:59.840> 17<00:04:00.469> so<00:04:00.709> actually<00:04:01.549> worse<00:04:01.909> reception<00:04:02.689> with

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
over 17 so actually worse reception with

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.349 
over 17 so actually worse reception with
it<00:04:03.109> up<00:04:03.349> but<00:04:04.009> again<00:04:04.219> that's<00:04:04.669> really<00:04:04.819> not<00:04:05.060> what

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
it up but again that's really not what

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.539 
it up but again that's really not what
this<00:04:05.540> case<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.079> all<00:04:06.199> about<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.859> meant<00:04:07.250> when
