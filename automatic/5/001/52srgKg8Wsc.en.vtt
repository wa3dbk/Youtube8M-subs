okay hey sort of charming sort of okay

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.900 
okay hey sort of charming sort of okay
very<00:00:34.550> cool

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 

I<00:00:38.940> forget<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.720> many<00:00:39.780> caps<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.380> have<00:00:40.530> outside

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I forget how many caps we have outside

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.490 
I forget how many caps we have outside
before<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:41.880> we<00:00:42.150> might<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.630> 20<00:00:43.080> cats<00:00:43.290> out

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
before I think we might have 20 cats out

00:00:43.500 --> 00:01:11.140 
before I think we might have 20 cats out
there<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.800> he's<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:46.980> he's<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.760> pet

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.230 

so<00:01:11.300> this<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.160> left<00:01:13.160> atrium<00:01:13.700> left<00:01:14.120> ventricle

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
so this is left atrium left ventricle

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.290 
so this is left atrium left ventricle
right<00:01:15.110> atrium<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.830> ventricle<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.730> his

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
right atrium right ventricle and his

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.400 
right atrium right ventricle and his
aorta<00:01:17.750> coming<00:01:17.990> out<00:01:18.490> here<00:01:20.410> subjectively

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
aorta coming out here subjectively

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.410 
aorta coming out here subjectively
everything<00:01:22.280> looks<00:01:22.490> really<00:01:22.910> good<00:01:23.530> have

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
everything looks really good have

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.280 
everything looks really good have
significant<00:01:26.770> underlying<00:01:27.770> disease<00:01:28.370> just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
significant underlying disease just

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
significant underlying disease just
looking<00:01:30.290> at<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:31.270> initially<00:01:32.890> that's<00:01:33.890> good

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.029 

right<00:01:39.659> now<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.110> putting<00:01:40.350> color<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
right now I'm just putting color on

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.270 
right now I'm just putting color on
which<00:01:41.579> allows<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.360> any<00:01:43.280> backflow

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
which allows me to see any backflow

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:56.109 
which allows me to see any backflow
blood<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.880> any<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> valves<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.810> anything

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.690 

now<00:01:56.600> look

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
now look

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.080 
now look
okay

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.270 

and<00:02:02.180> then<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.979> where<00:02:04.189> we<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:05.270> measure<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
and then this is where we we measure the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.270 
and then this is where we we measure the
heart<00:02:07.280> muscle<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:09.679> we<00:02:09.770> call<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> short

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
heart muscle in a what we call a short

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.180 
heart muscle in a what we call a short
axis<00:02:10.520> view<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.020> basically<00:02:12.500> taking<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
axis view so this is basically taking a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.360 
axis view so this is basically taking a
cross-sectional<00:02:14.180> view<00:02:14.980> through<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> heart

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
cross-sectional view through the heart

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.660 
cross-sectional view through the heart
and<00:02:16.700> then<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:17.720> measure<00:02:17.959> those<00:02:18.230> walls<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and then we measure those walls this

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then we measure those walls this
motion<00:02:22.670> right<00:02:22.700> here<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> mitral<00:02:23.959> valve

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
motion right here is the mitral valve

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.400 
motion right here is the mitral valve
and<00:02:24.560> that's<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.819> mitral<00:02:26.209> valve<00:02:26.390> opening<00:02:26.989> and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
and that's the mitral valve opening and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.009 
and that's the mitral valve opening and
then<00:02:27.530> closing<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:29.120> then<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.910> view<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
then closing and then this view is the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.960 
then closing and then this view is the
aorta<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.560> cross-section<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> left

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
aorta and cross-section and the left

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.630 
aorta and cross-section and the left
atrium<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.930> gives<00:02:36.200> us<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:37.220> should<00:02:37.250> be

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
atrium so that gives us a it should be

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.449 
atrium so that gives us a it should be
an<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.150> one-to-one<00:02:38.660> ratio<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.410> his<00:02:39.590> looks<00:02:40.220> very

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
an a one-to-one ratio and his looks very

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.880 
an a one-to-one ratio and his looks very
normal<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.430> then<00:02:44.239> out<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.650> his

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
normal and then out here this is his

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.770 
normal and then out here this is his
pulmonary<00:02:46.220> artery<00:02:46.940> that's<00:02:47.269> his<00:02:47.450> pulmonic

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
pulmonary artery that's his pulmonic

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
pulmonary artery that's his pulmonic
valve<00:02:48.140> right<00:02:48.319> there<00:02:48.530> that's<00:02:48.769> his<00:02:48.980> aorta<00:02:49.459> with

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
valve right there that's his aorta with

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.309 
valve right there that's his aorta with
this<00:02:49.819> aortic<00:02:50.330> valve

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.390 

this<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:54.040> will<00:02:54.879> get<00:02:55.060> flow<00:02:55.650> across<00:02:56.650> his<00:02:57.010> Pullman

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this is will get flow across his Pullman

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.610 
this is will get flow across his Pullman
up<00:02:57.489> pulmonic<00:02:58.000> valve<00:02:58.390> which<00:02:58.719> is<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:59.379> normal

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
up pulmonic valve which is very normal

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.190 
up pulmonic valve which is very normal
velocity<00:03:00.459> normal<00:03:00.640> blood<00:03:01.030> flow<00:03:01.090> through<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
velocity normal blood flow through the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.020 
velocity normal blood flow through the
heart<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.560> about<00:03:02.739> 1<00:03:02.950> meter<00:03:03.189> per<00:03:03.280> second

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
heart is about 1 meter per second

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.429 
heart is about 1 meter per second
so<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.739> amazing<00:03:06.810> yeah<00:03:07.810> he<00:03:08.079> actually

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
so that is amazing yeah he actually

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.240 
so that is amazing yeah he actually
looks<00:03:08.890> really<00:03:08.980> good<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.459> mean<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:12.129> know

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
looks really good I mean you know

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.640 
looks really good I mean you know
looking<00:03:12.900> looking<00:03:13.900> at<00:03:14.109> them<00:03:14.260> at<00:03:14.409> one<00:03:14.620> time

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
looking looking at them at one time

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.860 
looking looking at them at one time
frame<00:03:15.310> doesn't<00:03:15.879> give<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.299> picture<00:03:16.540> for

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
frame doesn't give you a picture for

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.390 
frame doesn't give you a picture for
what's<00:03:17.079> going<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.260> happen<00:03:17.650> later<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.220> life

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
what's going to happen later on in life

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.899 
what's going to happen later on in life
um<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.530> would<00:03:20.680> say<00:03:20.889> right<00:03:21.099> now<00:03:21.129> he<00:03:21.700> looks

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
um but I would say right now he looks

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.849 
um but I would say right now he looks
very<00:03:22.090> good<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.689> only<00:03:23.019> thing<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.439> looks<00:03:23.709> a

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
very good the only thing that looks a

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.000 
very good the only thing that looks a
little<00:03:24.069> bit<00:03:24.930> odd<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.200> he<00:03:26.379> has<00:03:26.560> something

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
little bit odd this he has something

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.670 
little bit odd this he has something

little<00:03:29.709> bright<00:03:30.250> spot<00:03:30.609> right<00:03:30.760> there<00:03:31.090> we

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
little bright spot right there we

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.610 
little bright spot right there we
consider<00:03:32.379> one<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:33.849> be<00:03:34.049> quote<00:03:35.049> unquote<00:03:35.169> normal

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
consider one to be quote unquote normal

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.059 
consider one to be quote unquote normal
um<00:03:36.549> but<00:03:37.480> there<00:03:37.659> is<00:03:37.840> an<00:03:38.200> actual<00:03:38.349> heart<00:03:38.739> disease

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
um but there is an actual heart disease

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.640 
um but there is an actual heart disease
where<00:03:39.400> they<00:03:39.549> get<00:03:39.700> an<00:03:40.000> abundance<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:41.169> moderator

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
where they get an abundance of moderator

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.929 
where they get an abundance of moderator
bands<00:03:42.159> hmm

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
bands hmm

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.490 
bands hmm
but<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:44.230> one<00:03:44.650> I'm<00:03:45.430> going<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.120> consider<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.470> be

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
but that one I'm going to consider to be

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.699 
but that one I'm going to consider to be
normal<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.730> normal<00:03:49.150> variant

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
normal like a normal variant

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.599 
normal like a normal variant
so<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.670> very<00:03:50.879> normal<00:03:51.480> looking<00:03:51.870> heart<00:03:52.609> so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
so that's a very normal looking heart so

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:54.309 
so that's a very normal looking heart so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.710 

be<00:04:42.920> fairly<00:04:43.250> cooperative<00:04:44.000> once<00:04:44.180> they<00:04:44.390> figure

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
be fairly cooperative once they figure

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.270 
be fairly cooperative once they figure
out<00:04:44.900> what<00:04:45.110> we're<00:04:45.260> doing<00:04:45.290> doesn't<00:04:45.650> hurt<00:04:46.010> them

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
out what we're doing doesn't hurt them

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.540 
out what we're doing doesn't hurt them
guru<00:04:47.680> sometimes<00:04:48.680> they<00:04:48.830> do<00:04:48.890> get<00:04:49.100> antsy<00:04:49.520> just

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
guru sometimes they do get antsy just

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.370 
guru sometimes they do get antsy just
because<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.180> don't<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:51.100> lay<00:04:52.100> still<00:04:52.550> but

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
because you don't like the lay still but

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.370 
because you don't like the lay still but
none<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.680> hurts<00:04:55.010> them<00:04:56.050> for<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.170> through

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
none of this hurts them for that through

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.910 
none of this hurts them for that through
the<00:04:57.530> blood<00:04:57.770> flow<00:04:58.040> out<00:04:58.820> his<00:04:59.240> aorta<00:04:59.710> which<00:05:00.710> is<00:05:00.890> a

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
the blood flow out his aorta which is a

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.090 
the blood flow out his aorta which is a
normal<00:05:01.160> velocity<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.150> then

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
normal velocity and then

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.610 
normal velocity and then
this<00:05:03.640> is<00:05:03.850> where<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.480> come<00:05:04.900> out<00:05:05.080> in<00:05:05.350> closed

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
this is where I come out in closed

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.050 
this is where I come out in closed
which<00:05:08.220> tells<00:05:09.150> us<00:05:09.390> how<00:05:09.660> well<00:05:09.950> he's<00:05:11.060> relaxing

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
which tells us how well he's relaxing

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.270 
which tells us how well he's relaxing
like<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:12.840> heart<00:05:13.050> muscles<00:05:13.440> relaxing<00:05:13.980> huh<00:05:16.280> can

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
like this heart muscles relaxing huh can

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.560 
like this heart muscles relaxing huh can
also<00:05:17.400> do<00:05:17.790> crazy<00:05:18.330> things<00:05:18.510> like<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.260> see<00:05:19.440> Doppler

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
also do crazy things like to see Doppler

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.210 
also do crazy things like to see Doppler
which<00:05:21.570> will<00:05:22.260> let<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.710> also<00:05:22.980> see<00:05:24.980> how<00:05:25.980> well

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
which will let you also see how well

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.760 
which will let you also see how well
they're<00:05:26.430> relaxing<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.480> more<00:05:28.080> specific

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
they're relaxing it's a more specific

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.410 
they're relaxing it's a more specific
indicator

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.540 

so<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.020> would<00:05:33.380> say<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.590> have<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:33.890> normal<00:05:34.340> cat

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.780 
so I would say you have a normal cat
