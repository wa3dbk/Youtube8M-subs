 the voice of Gustavo Cerati has a break 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.350
 it's not true there are a few breaks out there 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.350
 there are some highs that I think have for me 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.540
 been a bit too much so there has been 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.390
 a treble there in this song there is chorus 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.310
 but thou hast been significantly exceeded 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.470
 come out well from that and has put 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.920
 the weight of Gustavo's voice will be very 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.620

 accompanies from their homes like every night 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.490
 thanks for being there to see is this is 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.500
 a situation in which I have found 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.570
 sometimes because because it touched me 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.050
 teach sometime and always one has 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.950
 the student who does not come to classes as 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.440
 you and that the teachers reject as 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.670
 has happened now and also as you the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.900
 congratulations I congratulate you for your ability 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.490
 wait because they have waited like three 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.240
 weeks sitting there when you arrive 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 never arrived 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.460
 but that when he stops on stage 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.289
 can in a presentation like this 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.880
 shut up everyone's mouth because he has 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.880
 been very good 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.020
 that does not mean that you can not 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.090
 improve already you said it very well well 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.830
 that I 'm not going to go in there that has taken 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.819
 the teachers and the indications of 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.830
 jury that is working has 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.349
 disappeared the exit that has made 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.419
 appear a voice much more like the 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.400
 of cerati today I want to congratulate the 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.120
 characterization equipment 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 amparo will make his front root cristian 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.080
 nadita with the wardrobe I think that today 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.120
 I see you and you for the sacrifice you've made 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.550
 done with this look I've seen you super 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.370
 It seems to me that this brings 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.820
 very much 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.590
 to your band except that the zeta bosio 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.510
 Well, it seems he 's more a fan of David 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.100
 bisbal that its exterior 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.320
 we discovered it there dancing with 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.510
 bisbal but good we are not going to sing we go 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.490

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.070
 presentation very well the voice very well 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.169
 energy the dance copied as is 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.750
 I think it was your best presentation 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.250
 to date and you have to realize 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.320
 as I told you last time that is what 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.970
 which makes it finally hooked into a 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.070
 convinced because the first one is in 4 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.470

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.449
