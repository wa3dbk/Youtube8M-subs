00:00:34.250 --> 00:02:23.740 

you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.680 

he<00:02:24.260> blends<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.040> snow

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.000 

I<00:03:23.690> think<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.810> fun<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.200> fly<00:03:25.410> but<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
I think it's fun to fly but it is a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:04:20.810 
I think it's fun to fly but it is a
handful<00:03:27.080> hmm<00:03:37.610> it's<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.670> really<00:03:39.000> fast<00:03:39.330> handful

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.070 

the<00:04:21.820> first<00:04:22.090> flight<00:04:22.330> showed<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the first flight showed that the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.870 
the first flight showed that the
airplane<00:04:23.350> was<00:04:23.620> very<00:04:23.830> tail<00:04:24.130> heavy<00:04:24.340> using<00:04:24.759> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
airplane was very tail heavy using the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.310 
airplane was very tail heavy using the
standard<00:04:25.330> battery<00:04:25.539> in<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.930> standard

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
standard battery in the standard

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.189 
standard battery in the standard
position<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.910> only<00:04:28.270> way<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.419> fix<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.900> since

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
position the only way to fix it since

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.659 
position the only way to fix it since
there<00:04:29.380> isn't<00:04:29.560> much<00:04:29.860> room<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.190> move<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
there isn't much room to move the

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.839 
there isn't much room to move the
battery<00:04:30.850> further<00:04:31.330> forward<00:04:32.039> is<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.669> add<00:04:33.820> a

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
battery further forward is to add a

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.330 
battery further forward is to add a
little<00:04:34.180> bit<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.360> nose<00:04:34.599> weight<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:35.139> found<00:04:36.099> this

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
little bit of nose weight I found this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.260 
little bit of nose weight I found this
little<00:04:36.490> socket<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.270> my<00:04:38.250> toolbox<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.490> attached

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
little socket in my toolbox and attached

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.510 
little socket in my toolbox and attached
it<00:04:40.539> with<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.810> piece<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.289> elastic<00:04:41.530> which<00:04:42.370> were

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
it with a piece of elastic which were

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.159 
it with a piece of elastic which were
great<00:04:42.789> because<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.150> was<00:04:43.270> possible<00:04:43.539> to<00:04:43.810> move<00:04:44.050> it

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
great because it was possible to move it

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.589 
great because it was possible to move it
forward<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.590> backwards<00:04:45.039> until<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.789> found<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
forward and backwards until I found the

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.260 
forward and backwards until I found the
right<00:04:46.780> spot<00:04:47.110> for<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:48.610> turns<00:04:48.849> out<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
right spot for it as it turns out the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.779 
right spot for it as it turns out the
small<00:04:49.509> socket<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.110> elastic<00:04:50.590> weighs<00:04:50.860> 11<00:04:51.460> grams

a<00:04:52.500> small<00:04:53.500> piece<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:53.740> lead<00:04:54.070> was<00:04:54.639> cut<00:04:54.759> until<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
a small piece of lead was cut until the

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.719 
a small piece of lead was cut until the
correct<00:04:55.690> weight<00:04:55.960> was<00:04:56.199> obtained<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:57.580> was

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
correct weight was obtained and it was

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.790 
correct weight was obtained and it was
then<00:04:57.910> shaped<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:58.599> that<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.870> would<00:04:59.050> fit<00:04:59.080> around

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
then shaped so that it would fit around

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.430 
then shaped so that it would fit around
the<00:05:00.090> carbon<00:05:01.090> fiber<00:05:01.509> section<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.259> nose

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440

right behind the engine mounting the
lead<00:05:05.349> weight<00:05:05.530> was<00:05:05.770> then<00:05:05.919> secured<00:05:06.340> in<00:05:06.490> position

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
lead weight was then secured in position

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.020 
lead weight was then secured in position
using<00:05:07.410> water-resistant<00:05:08.410> electrical<00:05:09.070> tape<00:05:09.280> it

of a ready to fly package but

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.469 
of a ready to fly package but
unfortunately<00:05:16.270> they<00:05:16.930> had<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.229> set<00:05:17.470> up<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:17.650> that

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
unfortunately they had it set up so that

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.390 
unfortunately they had it set up so that
they<00:05:19.479> had<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.870> ailerons<00:05:20.380> on<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.889> left<00:05:21.070> stick

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
here but I am a mode 2 pilot so I want

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.790 
here but I am a mode 2 pilot so I want
my<00:05:31.180> ailerons<00:05:31.750> here<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.259> I<00:05:32.289> would<00:05:32.470> like<00:05:32.620> my

rudder<00:05:33.009> here<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:34.000> I<00:05:34.090> could<00:05:34.360> not<00:05:34.509> get<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:34.990> set

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
rudder here and I could not get it set

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.990 
rudder here and I could not get it set
up<00:05:35.289> using<00:05:35.620> their<00:05:35.889> radio<00:05:36.250> so<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:36.610> ended<00:05:36.909> up

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
up using their radio so I ended up

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.540 
up using their radio so I ended up
taking<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.509> receiver<00:05:37.990> out<00:05:38.199> and<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:39.159> set<00:05:39.430> it

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
taking the receiver out and have set it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.490 
taking the receiver out and have set it
up<00:05:39.669> with<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.479> 2.4<00:05:41.409> gigahertz<00:05:41.740> spectrum<00:05:42.070> mode

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
up with a 2.4 gigahertz spectrum mode

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.550 
up with a 2.4 gigahertz spectrum mode
it's<00:05:44.500> now<00:05:44.710> set<00:05:45.070> up<00:05:45.250> with<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:46.560> delta

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
it's now set up with a delta

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.180 
it's now set up with a delta
configuration<00:05:47.830> or<00:05:48.430> 11<00:05:48.900> so<00:05:49.900> right<00:05:50.710> stick<00:05:51.009> will

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
configuration or 11 so right stick will

configuration or 11 so right stick will
give<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.550> this<00:05:51.699> sort<00:05:51.940> of<00:05:52.060> deflection<00:05:52.840> up

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
give you this sort of deflection up

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.450 
give you this sort of deflection up
elevator<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.610> down<00:05:55.479> it<00:05:55.720> away<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.460> then

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
elevator and down it away and then

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.080 
elevator and down it away and then
there's<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.849> rudder<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.150> course<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.880> battery

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
there's the rudder of course the battery

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.439 
there's the rudder of course the battery
is<00:06:01.300> underneath<00:06:01.690> this<00:06:01.930> hatch<00:06:02.199> here<00:06:02.590> I<00:06:03.240> had<00:06:04.240> to

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
is underneath this hatch here I had to

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.120 
is underneath this hatch here I had to
take<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.020> little<00:06:05.229> bit<00:06:05.440> of<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.620> foam<00:06:05.830> away<00:06:06.070> so

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
take a little bit of the foam away so

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.800 
take a little bit of the foam away so
that<00:06:06.460> my<00:06:06.610> own<00:06:06.639> batteries<00:06:07.180> would<00:06:07.300> fit<00:06:07.570> there

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
that my own batteries would fit there

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.110 
that my own batteries would fit there
and<00:06:08.250> that's<00:06:09.250> just<00:06:09.340> my<00:06:09.580> little<00:06:09.759> spectrum
