00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.043
Hi, I'm Francis, 

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:10.141
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.604
First, rinse the moyashi bean sprouts 

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:31.285
and trim off the root ends.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.688
Place them into a pan.

00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:42.669
Add a sprinkle of salt 

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:46.165
and the sesame oil.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.093
Cover 

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:51.970
and turn on the burner.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.050
Heat the pan for 2 minutes.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:05.722
Then, roughly stir the moyashi to help cook evenly.

00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:16.278
Place onto a mesh strainer.

00:01:19.432 --> 00:01:24.015
Cool the moyashi with a fan to avoid overcooking.

00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:27.978
Next, let's make the sauce.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.128
Combine the sugar, soy sauce, 

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:35.799
vinegar 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.950
and the water.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.274
Stir and dissolve the sugar.

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.632
Then, add the grated ginger root 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.016
and the sesame oil.

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:55.186
Mix it again.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:04.988
Save 2 tablespoonfuls of the sauce on a plate.

00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:11.438
Now, let's prepare the shirataki noodles.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.561
Rinse the shirataki and cut the long noodles 

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:18.295
into shorter lengths with kitchen shears.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.111
Then, place the shirataki into a pot of boiling water.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.505
Bring it to a rolling boil 

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:30.809
and boil the noodles for about 30 seconds.

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:34.809
Now, strain the shirataki 

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:41.430
and discard the water from the pot.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.781
Place the shirataki back into the empty pot.

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:50.634
Turn the heat up to high 

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:54.604
and stir to remove any excess water.

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:59.306
This will help the noodles absorb the sauce later.

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:06.376
Now, place the shirataki onto the plate.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.667
Toss to coat with the sauce evenly.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:16.014
Chill the shirataki and the remaining sauce in the fridge.

00:03:17.648 --> 00:03:21.238
And now, place the toppings onto the noodles.

00:03:22.507 --> 00:03:25.553
Add the shredded cucumber 

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:28.092
and the tomato.

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.241
This Chinese-flavored barbecued pork is called 

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.865
Char Siu but you can substitute ham instead.

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:41.683
Add the Kinshi Tamago, shredded fried egg sheet 

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:47.365
and the moyashi bean sprouts.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.865
Finally, lightly stir the sauce 

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:54.270
and pour it over the Hiyashi Chuka.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.563
You can also add karashi hot mustard to taste.

00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:02.597
Even if the package says parboiling is not required, 

00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:05.954
we strongly recommend boiling the shirataki.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.267
This will help it to absorb the sauce 

00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:11.334
and reduce any unwanted flavor.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:22.040
Shirataki has very low calories so it is perfect for dieting.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.091
It is also rich in dietary fibers 

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.293
and helps maintain your digestive system.

00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:30.001
Good luck in the kitchen!
