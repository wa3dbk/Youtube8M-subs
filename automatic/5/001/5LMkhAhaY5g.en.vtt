and by talking to people find out about

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.380 
and by talking to people find out about
those<00:00:32.669> positions

those positions

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.920 
those positions
that's<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.410> networking<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.160> it's

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
that's what networking is it's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.290 
that's what networking is it's
essentially<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> positive<00:00:37.500> gossip

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300

anything<00:00:52.550> networking<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> essentially<00:00:54.149> like

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
anything networking is essentially like

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
anything networking is essentially like
that<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.050> only<00:00:55.230> thing<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.789> gossip<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that the only thing is that gossip has a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
that the only thing is that gossip has a
very<00:00:57.149> negative<00:00:57.390> reputation<00:00:58.050> where

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
very negative reputation where

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
very negative reputation where
networking<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> very<00:00:59.969> positive<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> idea

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
networking is very positive so the idea

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
networking is very positive so the idea
of<00:01:01.739> networking<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> talking<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> somebody<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
of networking is talking to somebody and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020 
of networking is talking to somebody and
