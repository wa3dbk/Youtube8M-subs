00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
up we see a 4b pencil that's right 4b

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.230 
up we see a 4b pencil that's right 4b
lead<00:01:06.510> pencil<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.560> shade<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.130> part<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.030> more

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
lead pencil to shade that part the more

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200 
lead pencil to shade that part the more
thicker<00:01:09.570> parts<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.040> ears<00:01:11.310> decided

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
thicker parts you know the ears decided

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.290 
thicker parts you know the ears decided
to<00:01:12.360> head<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.010> give<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.940> know

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
to head to give that you know

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.260 
to head to give that you know
textured<00:01:16.170> look<00:01:16.440> especially<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:17.970> our

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
textured look especially on these our

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.170 
textured look especially on these our
spines<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.710> yeah<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.250> applies<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
spines so yeah it applies to all the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.400 
spines so yeah it applies to all the
hedgehogs<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.110> though<00:01:22.400> for<00:01:24.200> shadow<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
hedgehogs to you though for shadow the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.190 
hedgehogs to you though for shadow the
hedgehog<00:01:25.440> when<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.040> shade<00:01:26.430> him<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:27.540> course<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hedgehog when I shade him of course I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.180 
hedgehog when I shade him of course I
use<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.160> more<00:01:29.400> bolder<00:01:30.090> LED<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.410> therefore

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
use a much more bolder LED so therefore

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.070 
use a much more bolder LED so therefore
4b<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.660> least<00:01:33.900> minimum<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.830> 2<00:01:35.070> B<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.080> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
4b or at least minimum of 2 B and the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.160 
4b or at least minimum of 2 B and the
darker<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.620> better<00:01:37.800> because<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:39.170> his

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
darker the better because you know his

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.730 
darker the better because you know his
color<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.740> black<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:41.390> sunny<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> blue<00:01:42.810> which

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
color is black and sunny is blue which

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.090 
color is black and sunny is blue which
is<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.950> lighter<00:01:44.280> shade<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.700> black<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.860> well<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
is a lighter shade of black and well the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.640 
is a lighter shade of black and well the
lightest<00:01:47.580> would<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:48.030> super<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> Hedgehog<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
lightest would be super the Hedgehog of

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.750 
lightest would be super the Hedgehog of
course<00:01:51.290> yeah<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:52.950> using<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
course yeah right now I'm just using the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.510 
course yeah right now I'm just using the
Pacer<00:01:54.260> which<00:01:55.260> is<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
Pacer which is to be and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.109 
Pacer which is to be and
yeah<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.450> putting<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.840> away<00:01:59.960> again<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:01.119> use

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
yeah just putting it away again I use

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.620 
yeah just putting it away again I use
that<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.630> outline<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.859> red<00:02:04.729> stripes<00:02:05.240> on

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that to outline the red stripes on

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.410 
that to outline the red stripes on
shadows<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.860> spines<00:02:08.229> yes<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.700> yeah<00:02:10.700> picked<00:02:11.300> up

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
shadows of spines yes and yeah picked up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.350 
shadows of spines yes and yeah picked up
the<00:02:11.599> four<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.989> led<00:02:12.620> again<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.220> did<00:02:14.000> some<00:02:14.180> more

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the four be led again and did some more

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.479 
the four be led again and did some more
shading<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.319> just<00:02:15.650> add<00:02:15.860> some<00:02:15.920> extra

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
shading you know just add some extra

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.089 
shading you know just add some extra
layers<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.330> top<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.720> what's<00:02:18.500> already<00:02:18.680> been

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
layers on top of what's already been

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.110 
layers on top of what's already been
shaded<00:02:20.769> yeah<00:02:21.769> now<00:02:22.220> i'm<00:02:22.280> gonna<00:02:22.400> show<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
shaded yeah now i'm gonna show you the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.860 
shaded yeah now i'm gonna show you the
white<00:02:23.480> parts<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.620> leftovers<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:26.360> especially

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
white parts the leftovers so especially

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.900 
white parts the leftovers so especially
in<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.440> area<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:28.069> got<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.370> create<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
in that area you got to create that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.199 
in that area you got to create that
round<00:02:29.420> texture<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.579> part<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
round texture because that part of the

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.170 
round texture because that part of the
head<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.780> more<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:34.040> more<00:02:34.160> closer<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.970> you

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
head is more it's more closer if you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.440 
head is more it's more closer if you
look<00:02:35.329> at<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.540> from<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.989> perspective<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.450> at

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
look at it from this perspective so at

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.420 
look at it from this perspective so at
that<00:02:38.930> point<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.349> would<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.860> shade<00:02:40.190> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that point you would have to shade a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.970 
that point you would have to shade a
little<00:02:40.819> bit<00:02:40.940> more<00:02:41.120> darker<00:02:41.660> or<00:02:41.930> otherwise<00:02:42.590> you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
little bit more darker or otherwise you

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.010 
little bit more darker or otherwise you
would<00:02:43.099> nom

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
would nom

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.290 
would nom
shade<00:02:44.740> another<00:02:45.070> layer<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> top<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:46.120> what

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
shade another layer on the top of what

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.260 
shade another layer on the top of what
you<00:02:46.420> shaded<00:02:46.720> already<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.860> continuing<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you shaded already so continuing on the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.270 
you shaded already so continuing on the
spines<00:02:49.840> are

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.210 

yes<00:02:53.760> around<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.209> corners<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.830> I

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
yes around the corners right there and I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.550 
yes around the corners right there and I
think<00:02:56.700> I'm<00:02:56.760> proof<00:02:57.120> yep<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.690> swapped<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.319> piece

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
think I'm proof yep I swapped the piece
