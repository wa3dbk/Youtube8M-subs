00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
this whole area and kind of utilize the
space<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.650> bit<00:01:19.860> better<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.490> still

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
space a little bit better we're still

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.719 
space a little bit better we're still
you<00:01:20.939> doing<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.729> guarding

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you doing the back to even guarding

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.560

method<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> woodchips<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.570> we

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
method with the woodchips so that way we

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
method with the woodchips so that way we
don't<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> water<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.500> much<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.040> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
don't have the water as much and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
don't have the water as much and then
when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> dig<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.850> underneath<00:01:30.200> here<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
when you dig down underneath here that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
when you dig down underneath here that
soil<00:01:32.100> stays<00:01:32.460> nice<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> moist<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.950> it's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
these are all our small cherry tomatoes
and<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.890> started<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:41.820> tiny<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> now

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and they started off really tiny and now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920 
and they started off really tiny and now
they're<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.229> exploding<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:45.180> we've<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
they're just exploding so we've got I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.980 
they're just exploding so we've got I
don't<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.140> how<00:01:46.350> many<00:01:46.409> tomato<00:01:46.950> plants<00:01:47.369> maybe

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
don't know how many tomato plants maybe

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.800 
don't know how many tomato plants maybe
what<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.610> d30

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
what do you think of the d30

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.120

and<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.320> we're<00:01:52.470> using<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> space

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and as you see we're using the space

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.740 
and as you see we're using the space
because<00:01:53.369> we've<00:01:53.520> got<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> tomato<00:01:54.060> plants<00:01:54.479> here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because we've got the tomato plants here

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.609 
because we've got the tomato plants here
and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.320> along<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.460> did<00:01:56.689> carrots<00:01:57.689> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and then along here we did carrots so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.770 
Center was disappearing
well<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> dug<00:02:24.910> underneath<00:02:25.239> there<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
well I dug underneath there and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.510 
well I dug underneath there and
apparently<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.770> gopher<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.370> was

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520

pulling down the garlic so we had to

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.740 
pulling down the garlic so we had to
replant<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.790> I'm<00:02:30.850> hoping<00:02:31.239> these<00:02:31.420> are<00:02:31.600> gonna

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750

other side of the garlic and we did that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050 
other side of the garlic and we did that
