00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 how to put a bicycle in the car 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.210
 in solo mode you are actually going 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 be a private session with you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 also we will not need a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.740
 gardener with you I parked her 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 in this place to the first division 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.200
 local 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.170
 I'll usually get into my 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 garage right leaving jenin outside 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 virtually blocking the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.510
 entrance of the garage 10 in that position 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 right 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.789
 I got here in the garage and I go where it is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 at peace bikes on the wall alierta and me 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.719
 I will put in place that bike that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 you see where the caught 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.770
 rufino to choose any bicycle that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 chose the simple bike but then you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 You can choose to get whatever you want there. 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.410
 buying did not want to spend money on 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 because I had these three 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.799
 bikes that are those bike cross nÃ© 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 so beauty, bmx then it's just 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 just pedaling forward 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.580
 to the front of the saying or until she goes 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.619
 disclose the law as google maps is played 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 out of the bike there and it's 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.630
 just you that if you do not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 need to activate the cell phone because you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 is not near the garage door 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.530
 simply press the triangle to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.320
 get on the bike and pedal and I do not know until 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.240
 the street below for you to walk away a little 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 from the garage because you need to call 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.430
 the right mechanic who still remembered that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.680
 the test low in fact I'm coming 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 to the next street still to avoid 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 problems you can not call the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 mechanic is a great one as well a blush 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 very simple in update 1.12 but not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's a shame you're going to miss a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930
 vehicle a certain bike 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.899
 arriving here I more or less put 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 here in the cell phone contacts and I go there 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 the mechanic is going to call the mechanic I'm going 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.880
 wait looks like that list of de 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.619
 vehicles from my right garage 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.099

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.390
 for him right 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.360
 I'll wait for the bike to appear on the mini 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.190
 map the personal vehicle appearing on the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.960
 mini map simply you can go back 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.480

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.880
 left looks there to our right the motorcycle

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.310
 her to us and we're pedaling up to 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.160
 our garage again right with the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.690
 garage with your bike and bike 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.690
 instead of standing on the wall 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.330
 she will stay in place in the place of the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.730
 ruf that the first bike in the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.670
 garage and then when you enter the garage 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.550
 You will see that the bike will be 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.020
 replaced by my beauty bike 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.150
