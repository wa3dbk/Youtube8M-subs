article it's a whole new story now this
to<00:02:29.470> me<00:02:29.560> throws<00:02:29.740> me<00:02:29.920> off<00:02:29.980> why<00:02:30.510> because

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to me throws me off why because

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.910 
to me throws me off why because
initially<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.690> whole<00:02:34.900> creating<00:02:35.710> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
initially it was this whole creating of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.530 
initially it was this whole creating of
universes<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.980> expanding<00:02:38.980> upon<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.540> that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
universes and expanding upon that that's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.990 
universes and expanding upon that that's
what<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.140> battle<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.470> gods<00:02:41.620> established<00:02:42.250> how

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
what the battle of gods established how

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.610 
what the battle of gods established how
there<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.300> other<00:02:43.570> how<00:02:44.080> there<00:02:44.230> multiple

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
there are other how there multiple

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.490 
there are other how there multiple
universes<00:02:45.190> they<00:02:45.340> basically<00:02:45.940> made<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.140> Dragon

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
universes they basically made the Dragon

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.450 
universes they basically made the Dragon
Ball<00:02:47.620> Z<00:02:47.800> burst<00:02:48.070> into<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.400> multiverse<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:50.460> when

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
Ball Z burst into a multiverse and when

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.300 
Ball Z burst into a multiverse and when
they<00:02:51.610> end<00:02:51.880> off<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.360> whole<00:02:52.540> new<00:02:52.690> story<00:02:53.310> I'm

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
they end off of the whole new story I'm

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
they end off of the whole new story I'm
hoping<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.210> they're<00:02:55.390> still<00:02:55.600> gonna<00:02:55.780> branch

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
hoping that they're still gonna branch

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.670 
hoping that they're still gonna branch
off<00:02:56.860> into<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.910> whole<00:02:58.120> multiverse<00:02:58.840> concept<00:02:59.590> of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
off into the whole multiverse concept of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.420 
off into the whole multiverse concept of
Tekken<00:02:59.980> Ball<00:03:00.130> Z<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.770> I'm<00:03:02.980> thinking<00:03:03.040> they

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
Tekken Ball Z but now I'm thinking they

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.580 
Tekken Ball Z but now I'm thinking they
might<00:03:03.520> not<00:03:03.640> do<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.240> we're<00:03:05.140> not<00:03:05.170> too<00:03:05.380> sure

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
might not do that so we're not too sure

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.340 
might not do that so we're not too sure
and<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.520> involves<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.970> wish<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:08.140> know

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
and it involves the wish and we know

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.780 
and it involves the wish and we know
that<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.800> are<00:03:08.830> some<00:03:09.160> witches<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.550> can't

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that there are some witches that can't

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.460 
that there are some witches that can't
be<00:03:09.940> granted<00:03:10.180> because<00:03:11.070> Shenlong<00:03:12.070> has<00:03:13.470> his

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
be granted because Shenlong has his

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.200 
be granted because Shenlong has his
powers<00:03:14.920> are<00:03:15.130> not<00:03:15.520> our<00:03:15.760> mission

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
powers are not our mission

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.930 
powers are not our mission
he<00:03:16.660> just<00:03:16.840> can't<00:03:17.110> grant<00:03:17.470> any<00:03:17.710> wish<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
he just can't grant any wish that you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.280 
he just can't grant any wish that you
want<00:03:19.240> like<00:03:19.300> there<00:03:19.510> are<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:19.840> much<00:03:19.960> that<00:03:20.200> are

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
want like there are so much that are

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.800 
want like there are so much that are
outside<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.680> his<00:03:20.860> realm<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:22.270> arriving

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
outside of his realm but arriving

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.220 
outside of his realm but arriving
someone<00:03:23.460> even<00:03:24.460> that<00:03:24.580> person<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.180> far<00:03:25.840> stronger

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
someone even that person is far stronger

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.250 
someone even that person is far stronger
than<00:03:26.440> himself<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:27.160> possible<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.989> looks

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
than himself is possible so it looks

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.030 
than himself is possible so it looks
like<00:03:29.410> there's<00:03:29.650> some<00:03:29.920> bad<00:03:30.220> guy<00:03:30.459> some<00:03:31.300> evil<00:03:31.660> dude

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
like there's some bad guy some evil dude

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.370 
like there's some bad guy some evil dude

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
knows who is revived according to the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.860 
knows who is revived according to the
text<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:39.209> Goku<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.450> others<00:03:40.660> are<00:03:40.750> gonna

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
text and Goku and the others are gonna

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.340 
text and Goku and the others are gonna
have<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.020> fight<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.290> person<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.320> me

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
have to fight this person so this to me

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.650 
have to fight this person so this to me
is<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.220> throw<00:03:45.489> off<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:48.180> because<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.450> thought

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
is the throw off but because I thought

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.240 
is the throw off but because I thought
that<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:50.080> would<00:03:50.140> actually<00:03:50.290> go<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.830> more<00:03:50.980> forty

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
that we would actually go the more forty

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.490 
that we would actually go the more forty
two<00:03:51.310> out<00:03:51.520> because<00:03:52.450> that's<00:03:52.720> what<00:03:52.959> all<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
two out because that's what all of the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.960 
two out because that's what all of the
assumptions<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.730> theories<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:56.970> notions

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
assumptions and theories and notions

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690 
assumptions and theories and notions
that<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.300> think<00:03:58.780> were<00:03:59.019> being<00:03:59.800> pushed<00:04:00.190> out<00:04:00.400> there

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
that I think were being pushed out there

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.199 
that I think were being pushed out there
when<00:04:01.300> it<00:04:01.420> came<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.750> next<00:04:01.959> Dragon<00:04:02.290> Ball<00:04:02.440> Z<00:04:02.650> movie

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
when it came to next Dragon Ball Z movie

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.530 
when it came to next Dragon Ball Z movie
involving<00:04:04.209> more<00:04:04.480> soul<00:04:04.810> Vegeta<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:06.100> should

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
involving more soul Vegeta and it should

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.540 
involving more soul Vegeta and it should
but<00:04:07.540> given<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> teaser<00:04:08.260> trailer<00:04:08.380> again<00:04:09.340> it's

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
but given the teaser trailer again it's

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.040 
but given the teaser trailer again it's
