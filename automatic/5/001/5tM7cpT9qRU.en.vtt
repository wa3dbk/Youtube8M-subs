00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello friends how were you welcome to 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.059
 how to play guitar player and 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.740
 good on this occasion he has asked the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.950
 friend heals and cota this give us 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 I asked to see if we could explain what 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.080
 I had done in a video this already 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.260
 can see on the screen how they are formed 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.250
 the scales for this one to see if that could 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.560
 make explain that put into practice 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.300
 well then it seemed to me that 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.080
 first I had to make a video that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.060
 will explain well theoretically shown 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.260
 how would it be in practice because the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.140
 practice what we do with these 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.329
 scales are doing exercises and learning 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 to use the patterns and learn it in the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.800
 scales well then I think that what 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.480
 important is to be able to understand the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 practice is to be able to understand well the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.800
 theory then I will try to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.060
 do your best to make it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.130
 better understand what is what is 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.290
 practice of these scales because as is 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.829
 form how we use them for what they are 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.530
 because they are formed in such a way and why 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.860
 they are done how they are made 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.950
 let's see we have as we already know 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.259
 all the notes that are 12 or the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.200
 natural are those that are not altered or 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.390
 be that it is not flat and not sustained 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.340
 Eb and sustained knew what 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 that helps us to lower or raise the note 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 the sharp goes up a semitone the flat 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.310
 down a semitone the semitone was when 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.630
 we do not make a full tone a tone 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.719
 complete is when we pass finger to network 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 and if we go from 2 to 2 sharp is a 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.960
 halftone if we pass like this is a king of king 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.670
 to me there is a complete tone so the others 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.390
 not then with this we knew it was the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.240
 tone the halftone and with this is what 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.039
 we use as a rule to know how it is 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.319
 composed a scale in the case of 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.829
 major scales for example the largest and 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.960
 the youngest one we will find it in 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.110
 the note which is either based on what 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.269
 that would be his root note his tonic always 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.580
 will have a tone a tone a semitone 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.349
 a tone a tomtom a semitone in the case 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.150
 of a greater in the case a minor 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.989
 it will always have a tone a semitone 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.700
 a tone a tone a semitone a tone and a 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.319
 tone as we had seen 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 also in what was the chords 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.810
 we know that there are degrees that would come 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.430
 to do this that we have here the degrees 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.170
 we already knew what they called tonic 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.110
 super tonic by sub dominant 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.209
 dominant its by and sensitive the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.700
 tonic is the first tone that we 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.680
 indicate what scale we are and the tones and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.850
 Halftone will tell us if it is smaller or 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.480
 higher 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.370
 and the amount of tones you have also 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.320
 is going to talk about what scale we are 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 using what is it that we scale 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.580
 speaking in this case let's talk 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 to start from the tonic day scale 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.230
 then we know well that of the 2 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 we have a tone to the king, so there's 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.120
 One is left to the king when there is a tone 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.770
 that from my alpha there is a semitone but that 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.410
 it would actually be a degree because there is a 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.690
 full tone of the fa to the sun we have another 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.430
 tone here we have another tone another tone and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.470
 a semitone that here we reach the eighth 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.450
 because we are talking about the scale of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.430
 2 what is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 the first scale because the first note 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.080
 we take like this reference in addition 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.849
 whenever they search theories of everything 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.250
 guy always usually going to 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.319
 talk about the scale of two because it 's the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.030
 most basic to undertake then what 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.760
 happens when we want to take us 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.980
 this technique well because here what 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.360
 we have is the halftone tones that we 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.640
 is talking about this is a scale 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.319
 from anthony here, that's why we see 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.480
 here we have tone all in a semitone 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.160
 tone halftone tone as it explains here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.440
 and this is what he is telling us is 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.599
 that is not focused on the different 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.360
 degrees that we see here that is that the do 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.519
 to be the tonic or root after the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 second degree the king is going to be the super 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.010
 tonic and so on as we see the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.260
 graphic here in this case on the scale 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.380
 tonic day consists of seven notes and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.120
 its octave or that there are eight notes but 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.150
 there are seven that are different and two that 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.610
 they are the same or 2 and 2 well 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.410
 so what happens on the guitar like 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.720
 we see here we have what is the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.609
 Fingerboard is the same thing that we have here 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.220
 what I am showing here are all 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.590
 the notes that are on the guitar in what 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.660
 that would be the air notes well as 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.340
 we find them social this is the note 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.770
 the notes that are given to the air and these 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.150
 would be the notes stepped well that is if 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.850
 well the notes that we 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 we would find if we take a 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.780
 guitar and we start with each string 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.570
 we start from the note the air my fa 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.090
 here would be the first and so on and 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.620
 here we have the sixth and the rest 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.680
 then what we can see here 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.620
 is that we start from 2 and this 2 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.050
 it is repeated in several places 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.389
 well then as we can see 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.289
 this 2 and this scale that I mark here 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.630
 which is repeated in this 2 and repeated in 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.090
 this 2 and it is repeated in this 2 and in this 2 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.150
 and in all 2 that there is and if we 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.440
 we go from 2 backwards it 's the same but 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.750
 we're just going here we're not going to have the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.440
 5 on the side is the same thing or we're going 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.350
 to have 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:20.430
 do re my fa sun yes or if it solfa my 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.230
 re do and this is what defines as 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.630
 we are going to use the scale the 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.850
 tonic day scale will always be with 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.650
 these notes on the whole guitar what 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.420
 here we have more acute notes since 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.310
 we have a more serious note then 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.190
 we scale that we're going to 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.230
 identify knowing that the 2 of the 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.600
 scale of a tonic major will have tone 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.280
 tone halftone tone tone halftone was going to 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.580
 spend on the whole guitar starting 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.200
 always from his tonic then the notes 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.980
 that we use to configure 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.660
 all the positions of the guitar 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.340
 guitar fretboard what we're going 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.380
 to find are what we call pattern 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.940
 that are going to be different patterns by 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.920
 example here we have a pattern that goes 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.660
 from the first fret to 4 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.370
 then we learn this pattern and already 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.590
 we know that this is the pattern that is going 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.030
 to use on the scale of 2 and for 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.310
 example we have this pattern that goes from 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.590
 from the fifth from the fifth fret 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.960
 to the eighth fret and we learn this 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.240
 pattern and what the patterns serve us 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.430
 is to memorize us the spaces 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.830
 because this pattern that we 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.990
 we have here it is repeated again 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.450
 example this we have here 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.170
 this of fa we will find it again 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.180
 here in this part of here well because here 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.090
 one octave is given on the 12th fret 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.130
 then we starting from the 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.070
 fret 2 and back we learn 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.300
 those patterns and out there in some 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.900
 scales will be that we have to learn 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.610
 a little bit later we are going to learn 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.290
 the patterns on the whole guitar well 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.840
 then we find ourselves 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.030
 patterns and what we have to do is 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.310
 to learn from memory because we 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.360
 they will serve for all scales 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.250
 simply the only thing we have to go 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.290
 changing is the root tone and it's going to 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.630
 set different but the same 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.180
 pattern view that's why it's called pattern 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.610
 when we play here here 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.770
 we will realize that this same 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.080
 will be moving according to the note that 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.260
 we are going to do or that in 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.910
 suddenly this pattern will not be in the 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.440
 will be according to the note that we are 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.030
 according to the scale that we are using it goes to 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.830
 being on another side can be of 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.350
 suddenly in a king can be in a if 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.670
 in a 2 we will see 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.800
 in the on the page where 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.140
 where I link to this course this channel 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.330
 there they have all the scales and the 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.980
 patterns and there are theories to go down to 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.360
 download and everything and all the patterns 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.360
 to be able to learn them well 

00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:59.979
 do not
