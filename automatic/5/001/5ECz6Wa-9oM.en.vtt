00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.930
 about 3 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 the heat loss 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.270
 are caused by bad or not 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 roof areas here can be so on 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.470
 easy ways to minimize the heating costs 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 and protect the environment 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.860
 that protects the purse and creates 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 more living comfort 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.060
 because the roof insulation not only keeps in the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.680
 winter cozy warm but protects 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.680
 even before summer overheating 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.430
 and the legislature makes pretended to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.269
 the current energy saving regulation 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.790
 The enev2009 will set limits for the 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.739
 energetic quality of the roof component 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.280
 set 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.260
 the minimum value is equal to 0 24 watts 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.930
 per square kilometer for the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.850
 Modernization is equivalent to one 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.129
 total thickness of at least 160 mm 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.879
 depending on the heat level of the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.879
 insulating material 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 The answer is child's play 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 this is how the generation 0 fabrics become 32 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.150
 realize 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 because that's what her roof is all about 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.950
 100 mm high save with one 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 combination of fully save insulation and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 additional 60 millimeters under rafters 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 insulation of EnEV2009 cater for 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.010
 insulating materials with worse heat sorry 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.260
 groups as 0 32 is valid in such a case 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.700
 The need to save additionally with 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.240
 be strengthened wooden 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 The professional calls this on Duplication and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.260
 by the particularly compact wool 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.510
 Structure with extra on a braid 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.030
 let the iso insulation materials who 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.610
 Generation 0 32 significantly cleaner 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.740
 cut and install better 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 insofar you have with their use 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.870
 several advantages are the processing 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.630
 manages cleaner the insulation quality is 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.789
 better 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.579
 but above all, be through the higher 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.250
 energy efficiency leaner construction 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:09.009
 possible that receives valuable living space 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.009
 and saves material and labor 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.639
 Numerous quality certificates like the 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.099
 blue angels and the certification of the 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.780
 institute building and environment and also the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.379
 Test winner of the prestigious foundation 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.299
 Warentest and Ã–kotest prove iso who 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.210
 roof insulation materials are sanitary 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:30.630
 harmless sustainable and efficient 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.020
 for the camps installation you need one 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.380
 zollstock a insulation knife one 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.210
 cut underlay and a message board 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 the message board enables safe 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.800
 work and a tailor-made 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.780
 For this purpose, a suitable 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.620
 simple woodwork plate of about 1 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.180
 meter thirty length and 30 cm wide 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 a cutting edge protects 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.460
 especially for concrete floors knives and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.860
 underground and can be from a simple 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.280
 thin hardboard or plasterboard plate 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.280
 consist 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 professional 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.440
 alternatively also use cutting tools 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.440
 and insulation cutting machines 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.659
 before it starts with the new insulation 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.849
 Should you hold it if available 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.489
 Remove material from the trays 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.579
 Dispose of properly and damage to the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.209
 fix old roof construction then go 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.049
 go ahead 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.560
 cut the role iso who integra 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:33.480
 20 32 with the knife on professional tip 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.950
 unroll them the insulation material roll 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.319
 slowly against a wall 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.030
 this is space-saving and does not whirl 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.030
 too many construction dirt on 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.750
 measure the distance between the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.600
 driven out at obvious 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.050
 Parallel save at several points 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.050
 measure up 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.459
 add 110 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.459
 adding to the result 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.400
 transfer the measure across to 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.440
 Alignment on the rock now while 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.390
 of the cutting one recognizes also that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.330
 a narrow roof slat as a cutting edge 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.580
 help is unsuitable is a broad 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.080
 on the other hand, a notice board allows one 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.109
 safe stand and a clean 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.970
 cut the burned out line 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.970
 Marking helps with the straight cut 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.510
 iso worth 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.360
 f1 is attached to one side and to 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.980
 the free side so pressed into that 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.590
 the felt is flush with the rafters 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.220
 bottom is through its jam 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.330
 ability is very good in danger 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.500
 Its location is also comfortable 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.470
 correct 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.810
 It is important that the individual insulation material 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.240
 mats are pushed close together 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.230
 and also to adjacent save none 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.230
 have joints 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.250
 also on 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.800
 components or penetrations of the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.050
 dammbene be careful that the full 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.880
 save depth is filled and no 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.849
 leaving empty cavities behind 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.160
 at the eaves means that in many 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.810
 that the insulation mats in the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.000
 lower row obliquely cut 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.860
 So you have to be optimal 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.050
 adaptation is ensured 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.419
 only with this care can be 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.210
 ultimately avoiding thermal bridges 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.550
 the maximum saving effect can be achieved and 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.240
 a permanently damage-free construction 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.090
 establish 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.710
 benefits tip the remaining pieces a role 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.150
 can also be in the next danger 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.460
 use combined 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.930
 falls through this endless laying 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.930
 almost no waste
