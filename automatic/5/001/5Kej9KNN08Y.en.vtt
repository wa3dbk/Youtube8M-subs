00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.420 
in the game after seeing how he could
this<00:01:40.859> game<00:01:41.069> can<00:01:41.279> be<00:01:41.310> reduced

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
this game can be reduced

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.210 
this game can be reduced
-<00:01:42.610> just<00:01:42.850> simple<00:01:43.450> if<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.870> stand<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.410> go<00:01:44.620> low<00:01:44.890> if

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
- just simple if you stand and go low if

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.120 
which is the same is that's very hard to
sidestep<00:02:06.220> or<00:02:06.630> back<00:02:07.630> down<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.740> it's<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
sidestep or back down so it's just a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.560 
sidestep or back down so it's just a
matter<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.399> being<00:02:09.670> really<00:02:10.060> good<00:02:10.210> having<00:02:10.390> good

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
matter of being really good having good

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.970 
matter of being really good having good
reflexes<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.290> stuff<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.830> just

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
reflexes and stuff and you can just

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.580 
reflexes and stuff and you can just
reduce<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.580> game<00:02:12.790> like<00:02:13.630> if<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.290> were<00:02:14.410> making

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
reduce the game like if you were making

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.490 
reduce the game like if you were making
a<00:02:14.860> stew<00:02:15.190> right<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.260> FRA

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
a stew right and you have all the FRA

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.130 
a stew right and you have all the FRA
but<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.370> reduce<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.870> meat<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
but then you reduce it to the meat and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.590 
but then you reduce it to the meat and
potatoes<00:02:20.610> Jack<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.820> meat<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.300> potato

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
thinking is that Thomas Hilfiger may not

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.279 
thinking is that Thomas Hilfiger may not
have<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.060> lot<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.270> experience<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:51.810> this<00:05:51.930> game<00:05:52.110> so

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
have a lot of experience in this game so

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.390 
have a lot of experience in this game so
he's<00:05:52.409> just<00:05:52.530> gonna<00:05:52.650> go<00:05:52.860> all<00:05:53.070> aggressive

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
he's just gonna go all aggressive

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.999 
he's just gonna go all aggressive
against<00:05:53.970> them<00:05:54.090> but<00:05:54.780> he<00:05:55.169> may<00:05:55.349> realize<00:05:55.800> that

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
against them but he may realize that

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.950 
against them but he may realize that
that's<00:05:56.220> a<00:05:56.370> big<00:05:56.550> mistake<00:05:56.759> because<00:05:57.180> Thomas<00:05:57.690> has

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
that's a big mistake because Thomas has

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.689 
that's a big mistake because Thomas has
some<00:05:58.139> great<00:05:58.349> defense<00:05:58.830> against<00:05:59.280> characters
