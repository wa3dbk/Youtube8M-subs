00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.050
 Hello good afternoon, today we have a new recycling and we will make a Christmas wreath, inspired 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.490
 in SANTA. I hope you like it and make it and help me share it. 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.490
 And the materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.060
 Plastic bottles, diamond, pegadiamantine, glue, stapler 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.959
 a ruler, a brush, scissors, the cutter, 2 wire hooks, tweezers and 1 folder or 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.740
 folder in black plastic, and a pencil. And let's start 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.120
 Well, as you know, I always have to forget something, 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 I forgot to tell you about the spray paint 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.539
 in red, Well, first let's cut our bottles, you know, we introduce 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.940
 cutter and then with the scissors we cut very well, and this is going to be where you have a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.940
 Marquita in the background, here you can see on the screen. Well since you cut them 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.350
 to work with them, we are going to need 13 bottles. Look for a tray among my curiosities, 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 little girls, and what I'm doing is accommodating, 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.600
 the bottoms of the bottles, to give it its shape 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 circular and know exactly where I can put them. And now what I'm going to do is paint 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.360
 with the spray in red, but we're going to use it from the inside, I'm 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 doing on the inside because that's how it shines. On the other hand, if we paint it on the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 from outside it looks opaque, even if our painting is bright 

00:01:56.673 --> 00:02:00.373
 . Here we have all our 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.280
 funds, and now what we're going to do, is to accommodate them and we're going to start stapling, if 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 only to staple. If you can give it 2 staples and that way you'll go until you finish your circle, 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:32.340
 or your crown. And now let's take our hooks and unscrew them from the part where 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 is bent and what we are going to do is give it our circular shape, I tell you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.310
 to have to join 2 hooks because with one will not compliment you, our crown, and now 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 I'm going to make a few small holes, with this that is hot to be able to enter, 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.820
 my wire in it, and then it would moor very well. I tell you this I did it to give you 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 firmness because if you did not stay very guango, or loose. 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.540
 And now we will take our folder 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.880
 and it measures 10 cms. and there doubles, you can also use some plastic bag or something black 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.290
 that works for you, because I had this, and I'm using it. And only 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 is to measure the 10 cms. and cut, and I'm going to join 2 staples. 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.290
 And to my belt I marked a buckle, only with the ruler, I made the scratched 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:26.040
 And now for the back, we're going to staple our belt in one of the bottle bottoms 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:37.029
 plastic and try to accommodate it so that it is as even as possible, that we do not leave 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.980
 to hang, then we put in the wire we put our folder and there we go back to staple. 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.129
 And we do the same for the other side. 

00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:02.427
 And having already stuck and all our belt, 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:10.279
 Well, only paint the buckle, only with the pegadiamantine in silver color, 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:20.219
 I did the scratching and then fill in. And now I just need to give a little bit of shine to our 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:27.379
 PET bottles. Here I am mixing, glue with red diamond, and already 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.270
 only when dry I will apply some varnish because I will put it in the part 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:44.330
 from outside and so to protect a bit the diamond. I appreciate your nice comments,
