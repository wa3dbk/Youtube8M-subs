 Belgium 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.390
 the treaty of austerity the treaty 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.390
 transatlantic the goal today but 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.850
 there is a European council so 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.160
 symbolically it's to show our 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.440
 European ministers but that the street is 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.690
 where we can do actions of 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.200
 blocking we know how did not prevent them 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.729
 to reach their meeting place but 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.650
 symbolically I think it's 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.740
 important I tell you to show that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.910
 uniting and we can get the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.770
 message of the people 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.580
