00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.950 
small at this point is going to help
create<00:00:39.780> vibration<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.710> want<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
create vibration now I don't want that

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.180 
create vibration now I don't want that
here<00:00:42.960> I've<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> roughing<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you're gonna find such as big beads and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
you're gonna find such as big beads and
whatnot<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> top<00:00:52.079> taper<00:00:52.379> coming<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
whatnot there's the top taper coming to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.060 
whatnot there's the top taper coming to
finish<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> from<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.980> start

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
finish and from here I can really start

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
finish and from here I can really start
to<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:56.699> image<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to get an image of what it is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.700 
to get an image of what it is
everything's<00:00:58.199> gonna<00:00:58.350> look<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> end

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
everything's gonna look like in the end

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
everything's gonna look like in the end
and<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:01.949> time<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and now it's time to go back in and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
and now it's time to go back in and
refine<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.010> once

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
refine that a little bit you see once

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.719 
refine that a little bit you see once
again<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.850> back<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> cut<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.810> more

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
again I'm going back in to cut some more

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.179 
again I'm going back in to cut some more
sizes<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> piece<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.770> notice<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.010> didn't

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
sizes into the piece you notice I didn't

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.050 
sizes into the piece you notice I didn't
do<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> beginning

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
do that all in the beginning

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
do that all in the beginning
you're<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.900> gonna<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.140> ahead<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.290> rough<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you're not gonna go ahead and rough in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.249 
you're not gonna go ahead and rough in
some<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> these<00:01:14.100> beads<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:15.000> place

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
some of these beads that take place

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.510 
some of these beads that take place
beads<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.500> remove<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> material<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
beads don't remove a lot of material to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
beads don't remove a lot of material to
have<00:01:17.729> roughed<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> good

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
have roughed in so it's a it's a good

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
have roughed in so it's a it's a good
thing<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> rough<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.770> first<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.570> way<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
thing to rough in first and that way I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.230 
thing to rough in first and that way I
maintain<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.890> material<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.060> piece

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
maintain as much material on the piece

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
maintain as much material on the piece
as<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.590> helps<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> reduce

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
as I can which really helps me to reduce

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.770 
as I can which really helps me to reduce
vibration<00:01:28.189> I'm<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> I've<00:01:30.450> sort

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
vibration I'm gonna go back in I've sort

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
vibration I'm gonna go back in I've sort
of<00:01:30.810> roughed<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.439> those<00:01:31.560> Cubs<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.159> gonna

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of roughed in where those Cubs are gonna

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.740 
of roughed in where those Cubs are gonna
go<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.360> touch<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.540> the

go and that little touch with the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
go and that little touch with the
parting<00:01:34.049> tool<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.500> helps<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.130> started

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
how I started in the middle of the piece

how I started in the middle of the piece
that<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.879> all<00:02:18.629> these<00:02:19.019> thin<00:02:19.319> areas<00:02:19.620> near<00:02:19.769> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
in the middle so doing the middle first

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.400 
in the middle so doing the middle first
really<00:02:23.010> helps<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.489> whole<00:02:23.640> process<00:02:24.410> here
