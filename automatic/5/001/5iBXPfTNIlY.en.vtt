00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.890
 We visited the jps 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 Yeah is the house Yara 502 si because Epstein 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.870
 Huh 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.930
 With a guy bought at 9000 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.250
 I do not have bluetooth 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.820
 Because it is 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.690
 Anne push 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.010
 Be a speaker 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.010
 I made it sound 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.620
 It's a liquid crystal monitor, but I said this already clearly and can not see noon 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.340
 Almost 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 So although you will only hear here should I be careful in that case 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 It will be annoying to say clearly that it is a large volume like now in a residential area, so adjust 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.710
 It had defended so as to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.590
 I think I'm trying to improve it. 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:18.500
 I was following that lower part 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:22.570
 As we do not use turn signal switch, we intend to change the volume with this 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.570
 So it's still about prototyping 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.720
 People to this kind of stupid thing I Well postal turnip but I think that not so much 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:41.870
 Huh 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:44.450
 The cigarette socket power is turned on in this, so 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'm drilling to get there 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.760
 Well still 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.060
 Because it is a prototype stage 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.280
 This is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 Which it is where of here or with about a little like this Fu to something 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.810
 If you don't put up that support, you'll feel like it's broken. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.020
 I felt like I saw it a little 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.020
 Well 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.200
 I will do that gear 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.200
 Chopsticks the road circuitous one body
