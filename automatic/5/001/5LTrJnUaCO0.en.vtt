helping<00:04:05.680> out<00:04:05.920> his<00:04:06.070> network<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.000> helping<00:04:07.299> out

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
helping out his network and helping out

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.810 
helping out his network and helping out
the<00:04:08.049> channel<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.530> from<00:04:09.160> here<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.340> out<00:04:09.549> it's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
the channel and from here on out it's

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.360 
the channel and from here on out it's
just<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.360> just<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:11.010> Paragon<00:04:12.010> don't<00:04:12.190> have<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
just it's just up Paragon don't have a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.240 
just it's just up Paragon don't have a
tie-in<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.250> personal

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
tie-in so this is a personal

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.620 
tie-in so this is a personal
recommendation<00:04:15.549> I'm<00:04:16.090> not<00:04:16.239> part<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
recommendation I'm not part of the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.469 
recommendation I'm not part of the
network<00:04:16.780> yet<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.579> video<00:04:18.880> will<00:04:19.180> not<00:04:19.209> be

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
network yet so this video will not be

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.240 
network yet so this video will not be
getting<00:04:19.600> monetized<00:04:20.169> neither<00:04:20.709> will<00:04:20.919> any<00:04:21.070> other

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
getting monetized neither will any other

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.089 
getting monetized neither will any other
video<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:22.349> think<00:04:23.349> it<00:04:23.650> doesn't<00:04:23.800> matter<00:04:24.010> that

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
video so I think it doesn't matter that

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.070 
video so I think it doesn't matter that
I'm<00:04:24.340> saying<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.870> from<00:04:26.020> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
I'm saying this this is this is from the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.060 
I'm saying this this is this is from the
heart

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070
