00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
me out here and what we will be doing is

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.319 
me out here and what we will be doing is
pulling<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> exhaust<00:00:25.380> off<00:00:25.739> of<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.340> car<00:00:26.669> now

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
pulling the exhaust off of this car now

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.510 
pulling the exhaust off of this car now
most<00:00:27.660> folks<00:00:27.810> who<00:00:28.259> are<00:00:28.649> experienced<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.340> auto

most folks who are experienced with auto

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.920 
most folks who are experienced with auto
restoration<00:00:29.759> wouldn't<00:00:30.390> consider<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
restoration wouldn't consider this

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.549 
restoration wouldn't consider this
actually<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.649> full-on<00:00:32.279> step<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.410> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
actually a full-on step but what this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
actually a full-on step but what this
allows<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.210> addition<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
allows you to do is in addition to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
allows you to do is in addition to
getting<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> exhaust<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.860> which

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
getting the exhaust out of the way which

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
getting the exhaust out of the way which
is<00:00:38.220> very<00:00:39.149> important<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.780> comes<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
is very important when it comes to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.259 
is very important when it comes to
getting<00:00:40.679> other<00:00:40.920> pieces<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> car<00:00:41.789> exposed

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
getting other pieces of the car exposed

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.630 
getting other pieces of the car exposed
this<00:00:43.019> is<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.530> real<00:00:43.769> opportunity<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this is your first real opportunity to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
this is your first real opportunity to
get<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.089> underneath<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> car<00:00:46.109> spend<00:00:47.010> some

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
get down underneath the car spend some

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
get down underneath the car spend some
time<00:00:47.370> taking<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.000> at<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> you'll<00:00:48.839> want<00:00:49.109> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
time taking a look at it you'll want to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
time taking a look at it you'll want to
be<00:00:49.530> able<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.859> get<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:50.760> really

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
be able to get down there and really

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
be able to get down there and really
study<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> undercarriage<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> car

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
study what the undercarriage of the car

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
study what the undercarriage of the car
looks<00:00:53.519> like<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.210> important<00:00:54.719> for

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
looks like this will be important for

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.770 
looks like this will be important for
you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.859> getting<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.219> gas<00:00:56.460> tank<00:00:56.910> out<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you know getting a gas tank out for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.250 
you know getting a gas tank out for
pulling<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> transmission<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.179> checking<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pulling the transmission for checking to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.739 
pulling the transmission for checking to
ensure<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.920> body<00:01:02.249> is<00:01:02.429> in<00:01:02.749> appropriate

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
ensure that the body is in appropriate

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.530 
ensure that the body is in appropriate
shape<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.480> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
shape down there so there's a lot of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.860 
shape down there so there's a lot of
stuff<00:01:06.780> involved<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.220> basically<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:09.480> simple

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
stuff involved but basically the simple

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.630 
stuff involved but basically the simple
part<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.620> really<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.250> removing

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
part of it is is really just removing

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.710 
part of it is is really just removing
the<00:01:11.909> exhaust<00:01:12.320> now<00:01:13.729> normally<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.030> most<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> my

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the exhaust now normally on most of my

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
the exhaust now normally on most of my
restoration<00:01:16.290> steps<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.700> whatever<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
restoration steps it's pull whatever the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
restoration steps it's pull whatever the
assembly<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.130> immediately<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> restore<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
assembly is immediately to restore it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
assembly is immediately to restore it
and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.090> stock<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.600> away<00:01:21.780> somewhere<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.829> in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and then stock it away somewhere now in

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.069 
and then stock it away somewhere now in
the<00:01:23.189> case<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.399> an<00:01:23.670> exhaust<00:01:24.090> system<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.899> of

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
the case of an exhaust system because of

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.440 
the case of an exhaust system because of
the<00:01:25.290> bulk<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.490> nine<00:01:26.880> times<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the bulk and because nine times out of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.679 
the bulk and because nine times out of
ten<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:28.049> gets<00:01:28.290> pitched<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> replaced<00:01:29.689> there

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
ten it gets pitched and replaced there

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.550 
ten it gets pitched and replaced there
isn't<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.320> restoration<00:01:32.280> point<00:01:32.610> here

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
isn't really a restoration point here

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
isn't really a restoration point here
what<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.680> normally<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.579> simply<00:01:35.850> hold

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
what we normally do is just simply hold

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
what we normally do is just simply hold
off<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:37.289> acquire<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.890> exhaust<00:01:38.250> once<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
off we acquire the exhaust once the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
off we acquire the exhaust once the
engine<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> car<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.350> once<00:01:40.560> we're

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
engine is back in the car or once we're

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.020 
engine is back in the car or once we're
putting<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> engine<00:01:41.189> back<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.789> car<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
putting the engine back in the car and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
putting the engine back in the car and
it's<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:42.869> last<00:01:43.110> assemblies<00:01:43.740> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it's one of the very last assemblies to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's one of the very last assemblies to
go<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.500> mainly<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.189> pull

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
go back on so this is mainly just a pull

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
go back on so this is mainly just a pull
a<00:01:47.670> survey<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> underneath<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> car

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a survey of the underneath of the car

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480 
a survey of the underneath of the car
and<00:01:51.320> getting<00:01:52.320> ready<00:01:52.469> for<00:01:52.710> next<00:01:52.770> steps<00:01:53.039> now<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and getting ready for next steps now you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
and getting ready for next steps now you
may<00:01:53.700> city<00:01:54.030> note<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> strange

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
may city note that I have a strange

appliance attached to my head I got a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.770 
appliance attached to my head I got a
new<00:01:57.299> toy<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.930> we're<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> try<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.250> out

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
new toy and we're going to try it out

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.149 
new toy and we're going to try it out
videotaping<00:02:00.780> underneath<00:02:01.350> hopefully<00:02:01.950> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
videotaping underneath hopefully this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.399 
videotaping underneath hopefully this
will<00:02:02.369> give<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.789> video<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.450> exactly<00:02:03.929> where<00:02:04.229> I'm

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
will give you video of exactly where I'm

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.529 
will give you video of exactly where I'm
looking<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:05.039> rather<00:02:05.429> than<00:02:05.609> having<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.000> camera

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
looking at rather than having a camera

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.440 
looking at rather than having a camera
basically<00:02:06.929> pointed<00:02:07.679> at<00:02:07.829> me<00:02:08.100> as<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:09.179> try<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
basically pointed at me as I try to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.200 
basically pointed at me as I try to
describe<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.229> doing<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.210> without

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
describe what I'm doing so without

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.390 
describe what I'm doing so without
further<00:02:12.390> ado<00:02:12.900> we'll<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.350> ahead<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:14.160> down

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
further ado we'll go ahead and get down

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.170 
further ado we'll go ahead and get down
and<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.700> underneath<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> car

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.120 

so<00:02:19.180> despite<00:02:19.720> having<00:02:19.990> only<00:02:20.230> two<00:02:20.410> buttons<00:02:20.920> I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
so despite having only two buttons I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.160 
so despite having only two buttons I
obviously<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.910> not<00:02:22.090> mastered<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> GoPro

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
obviously have not mastered the GoPro

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.830 
obviously have not mastered the GoPro
video<00:02:23.470> camera<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.790> tell<00:02:25.030> there

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
video camera because you can tell there

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100 
video camera because you can tell there
is<00:02:26.020> no<00:02:26.200> exhaust<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.010> car<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:28.840> all<00:02:28.990> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
is no exhaust on this car got all the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.750 
is no exhaust on this car got all the
way<00:02:29.200> through<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> removal<00:02:29.740> only<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> realize

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
way through the removal only to realize

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.730 
way through the removal only to realize
i<00:02:30.790> hadn't<00:02:31.180> been<00:02:31.300> recording<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.500> kind<00:02:32.620> of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
i hadn't been recording it's kind of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.170 
i hadn't been recording it's kind of
difficult<00:02:32.920> when<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.400> realize<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
difficult when you realize that the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.880 
difficult when you realize that the
cameras<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.690> your<00:02:34.840> head<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.050> can't<00:02:35.470> see<00:02:35.740> it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
cameras on your head you can't see it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.940 
cameras on your head you can't see it
but<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.670> goes<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> quick<00:02:38.350> recap<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
but so it goes so a quick recap the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.720 
but so it goes so a quick recap the
original<00:02:41.950> exhaust<00:02:42.250> should<00:02:42.490> have<00:02:42.580> had<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
original exhaust should have had a

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.960 
original exhaust should have had a
hanger<00:02:43.180> here<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:44.080> did<00:02:44.410> not<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.800> was<00:02:44.830> missing<00:02:45.340> so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
hanger here it did not it was missing so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.940 
hanger here it did not it was missing so
there<00:02:46.300> was<00:02:46.390> nothing<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.750> reduce<00:02:46.900> undo<00:02:47.590> there

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there was nothing to reduce undo there

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.750 
there was nothing to reduce undo there
as<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.970> were<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.360> we<00:02:49.390> stopped<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:49.959> looked<00:02:50.320> at

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
as we were here we stopped we looked at

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.570 
as we were here we stopped we looked at
this<00:02:51.760> inner<00:02:52.030> panel<00:02:52.540> here<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.220> spent<00:02:54.220> more

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
this inner panel here and spent more

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.850 
this inner panel here and spent more
time<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.360> inner<00:02:55.900> panel<00:02:56.320> here<00:02:56.620> where<00:02:56.800> you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
time on that inner panel here where you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.050 
time on that inner panel here where you
can<00:02:56.950> actually<00:02:57.160> see<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.489> rust<00:02:57.640> has<00:02:57.820> come

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
can actually see the rust has come

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.479 
can actually see the rust has come
through<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.260> as<00:02:59.290> part<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.920> our<00:03:00.070> work<00:03:00.250> we're

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
through so as part of our work we're

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.759 
through so as part of our work we're
going<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.180> go<00:03:01.300> through<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.780> repair

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
going to have to go through and repair

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.070 
going to have to go through and repair
those<00:03:03.010> as<00:03:03.250> well<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:04.030> pause<00:03:04.269> for<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.690> moment<00:03:04.810> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
those as well we pause for a moment and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.960 
those as well we pause for a moment and
took<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> look<00:03:05.380> at<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.739> gas<00:03:05.980> tank<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.700> saw<00:03:06.910> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
took a look at the gas tank and saw the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.070 
took a look at the gas tank and saw the
bolts<00:03:07.600> were<00:03:07.750> intact<00:03:08.310> tag<00:03:09.310> itself<00:03:10.080> sounds

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
bolts were intact tag itself sounds

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.590 
bolts were intact tag itself sounds
really<00:03:11.500> good<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:12.730> got<00:03:12.880> some<00:03:13.060> duck<00:03:13.360> on

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
really good and it's got some duck on

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.620 
really good and it's got some duck on
the<00:03:14.640> drain<00:03:15.640> which<00:03:15.850> means<00:03:16.120> there<00:03:16.330> might<00:03:16.450> still

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
the drain which means there might still

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.540 
the drain which means there might still
be<00:03:16.780> some<00:03:16.870> varnish<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.620> tech<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.040> drain<00:03:18.340> out

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
be some varnish in the tech to drain out

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.990 
be some varnish in the tech to drain out
when<00:03:18.730> we<00:03:18.910> remove<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:20.560> slid<00:03:20.890> forward<00:03:21.310> and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
when we remove it so we slid forward and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.860 
when we remove it so we slid forward and
took<00:03:22.150> time<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.480> saw<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.840> springs<00:03:23.290> looked<00:03:23.530> okay

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
took time I saw the springs looked okay

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.060 
took time I saw the springs looked okay
shocks<00:03:25.870> we're<00:03:26.079> going<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.260> rebuild<00:03:26.440> anyways

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
shocks we're going to rebuild anyways

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.069 
shocks we're going to rebuild anyways
the<00:03:27.489> differential<00:03:28.239> doesn't<00:03:28.570> look<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.930> it's

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
the differential doesn't look like it's

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.979 
the differential doesn't look like it's
too<00:03:29.260> bad<00:03:29.440> i<00:03:29.500> don't<00:03:29.829> see<00:03:30.010> d<00:03:30.070> major<00:03:30.370> leaks<00:03:30.989> but

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
too bad i don't see d major leaks but

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.430 
too bad i don't see d major leaks but
what<00:03:32.140> we<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.590> see<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.750> fuel<00:03:35.230> pump

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
what we do is see is that the fuel pump

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.470 
what we do is see is that the fuel pump
has<00:03:35.799> been<00:03:36.010> replaced<00:03:36.280> at<00:03:36.610> some<00:03:36.790> point<00:03:37.239> with<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
has been replaced at some point with a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640 
has been replaced at some point with a
facet<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.500> was<00:03:38.620> very<00:03:39.060> poorly<00:03:40.060> wired<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.959> so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
facet and it was very poorly wired in so

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.080 
facet and it was very poorly wired in so
that's<00:03:42.100> going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.549> be<00:03:42.670> yanked<00:03:43.000> out

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
that's going to have to be yanked out

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.420 
that's going to have to be yanked out
we'll<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.690> make<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> decision<00:03:44.079> on<00:03:44.620> whether

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
we'll have to make a decision on whether

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.449 
we'll have to make a decision on whether
or<00:03:45.670> not<00:03:45.790> we<00:03:45.970> go<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.269> an<00:03:46.360> aftermarket<00:03:46.900> pump<00:03:47.459> or

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
or not we go with an aftermarket pump or

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.750 
or not we go with an aftermarket pump or
a<00:03:48.959> proper<00:03:49.959> su<00:03:50.590> pump<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:52.680> main<00:03:53.680> body<00:03:54.010> you'll

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
a proper su pump the main body you'll

learnt when removing the exhaust was if

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.750 
learnt when removing the exhaust was if
you<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.760> that<00:04:50.790> correctly<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.950> exhaust

bad<00:05:17.670> huh<00:05:18.150> there's<00:05:18.480> still<00:05:18.630> some<00:05:18.780> bluing<00:05:19.170> on<00:05:19.290> the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
bad huh there's still some bluing on the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.460 
bad huh there's still some bluing on the
tire<00:05:19.590> from<00:05:19.890> when<00:05:20.100> they<00:05:20.250> installed<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.470> what

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
tire from when they installed it so what

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.670 
tire from when they installed it so what
we<00:05:22.620> did<00:05:22.800> here<00:05:23.280> is<00:05:23.580> remove<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.120> bolts<00:05:24.690> there<00:05:25.500> is

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
we did here is remove the bolts there is

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.740 
we did here is remove the bolts there is
a<00:05:25.710> mount<00:05:26.160> halfway<00:05:26.730> down<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:26.910> car<00:05:27.330> where<00:05:27.600> we

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
a mount halfway down the car where we

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.020 
a mount halfway down the car where we
remove<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.440> third<00:05:28.740> mount<00:05:29.040> was<00:05:29.310> missing<00:05:29.760> so

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
remove the third mount was missing so

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.930 
remove the third mount was missing so
that<00:05:30.150> we<00:05:30.300> didn't<00:05:30.540> have<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.750> do<00:05:30.870> anything<00:05:31.080> with

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
that we didn't have to do anything with

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.830 
that we didn't have to do anything with
and<00:05:33.200> now<00:05:34.200> we'll<00:05:34.440> pull<00:05:34.770> out<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.450> exhaust<00:05:36.450> and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
and now we'll pull out the exhaust and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.450 
and now we'll pull out the exhaust and
take<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> look<00:05:37.230> at<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.410> up<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.890> air<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.070> see

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
take a look at it up in the air and see

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.570 
take a look at it up in the air and see
what<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.670> looks<00:05:38.850> like

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.470 

alright<00:05:42.580> so<00:05:42.820> now<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.090> we've<00:05:43.180> got<00:05:43.330> the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
alright so now that we've got the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.360 
alright so now that we've got the
exhaust<00:05:43.780> out<00:05:44.170> you<00:05:44.440> can<00:05:44.560> see<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.860> overall<00:05:45.220> I

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
exhaust out you can see that overall I

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.000 
exhaust out you can see that overall I
mean<00:05:45.670> there<00:05:46.330> are<00:05:46.420> no<00:05:46.510> holes<00:05:46.840> in<00:05:47.170> it<00:05:47.320> so

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
mean there are no holes in it so

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.110 
mean there are no holes in it so
technically<00:05:48.400> that's<00:05:48.580> okay<00:05:49.050> however<00:05:51.120> the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
technically that's okay however the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.420 
technically that's okay however the
clamp<00:05:52.480> and<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.470> business<00:05:53.890> end<00:05:54.100> up<00:05:54.250> at<00:05:54.400> the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
clamp and the business end up at the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.710 
clamp and the business end up at the
manifold<00:05:54.970> is<00:05:55.120> completely<00:05:55.800> rusted<00:05:56.800> away<00:05:57.480> as<00:05:58.480> is

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
manifold is completely rusted away as is

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.680 
manifold is completely rusted away as is
anything<00:05:59.140> that<00:05:59.200> was<00:05:59.440> inside<00:05:59.830> of<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.420> I'm<00:06:01.420> the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
anything that was inside of it I'm the

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.000 
anything that was inside of it I'm the
mid-length<00:06:02.680> clamp<00:06:03.190> is<00:06:04.860> definitely<00:06:05.860> seen

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
mid-length clamp is definitely seen
