00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.939
 Hello dear craftsman 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.250
 Today I want you a paper plane 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.870
 explain to tinkering is and indeed 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.880
 not easy the simple 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.320
 swallow but a look was that is 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.020
 one of the loops can fly 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.470
 for that we need a din a4 sheet 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.039
 no matter what color and a pair of scissors because 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.500
 we will cut the wings afterwards 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.180
 it's easy going on we take the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.190
 Motive page if your motive on it 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.199
 comes down 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.960
 otherwise it does not matter how the main thing that 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.339
 sheet stands upright first if you 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.920
 the paper is uniquely beautiful neat 04 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.620
 So it's very important that you play 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.710
 they fold the corners nicely together 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.870
 not and really nice feist yes 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.559
 that means it should be really nice 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:59.649
 are then pressed apart again 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:03.370
 then it should be easy 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.199
 right and left or side folds 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 to dashed lines the middle 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.649
 on 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.719
 again nice on it 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.600
 pay attention to being recognized above 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.719
 neatly indicating 94 views and then am 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.909
 best of the middle beauties in 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:24.670
 both directions altogether once 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.640
 Nice to lay around nicely located 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.210
 have the best in the middle of the middle 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.219
 partly now you fold the sheet the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.640
 top 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.109
 three times down it's about 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.850
 We have to be sure 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.609
 get ahead than down here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.399
 that means we almost keep it down 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.320
 that almost to the edge once just latte 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.289
 fold nicely from the middle again 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.260
 then just a second time in the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.680
 width 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.500
 have started to hold so again 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.500
 nice under it remains with the track here 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.540
 on it so that one has a right angle 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.580
 nice neat fold so schÃ¶nfeld 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.240
 his music pleases and then 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.240
 just a third time 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.900
 So once I asked pointing it out the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.070
 first time in any case to somewhere 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.600
 including a bit more than that 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.820
 half I have now with him he even one 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.860
 folded is not bad then one 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.360
 second time exactly the same height, the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.230
 we jumped in the first case then 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 third time 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.570
 Now we turn the sheet of paper 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.630
 Just make it nice again and full 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.050
 put it the other way round exactly in the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.440
 neighborhood 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.290
 So I'm doing a hard season is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.260
 for fat and heavy and therefore some 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.760
 just hook there it is nicer 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 what does everyone have to do for themselves? 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.530
 try is good to fold so 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.970
 not nice 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.350
 he flies strangely yet the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.510
 is the demonstration effect with that we see 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.090
 also will not fly perfect 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.239
 he should stay that way left is ours 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.920
 support that will ultimately be the top 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 Afterwards , we bend it 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.420
 just like and radically see how 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.810
 Now you can wind and bend 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.820
 see 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.080
 so he will be laughing now 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.420
 let's cut the back wing 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.769
 one, and we go a bit 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.140
 lower down here and about 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.790
 Here the kink is afterwards can 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.950
 pretty far down so definitely 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.810
 to the half 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.470
 That would not be half of it yet 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.790
 longer 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.550
 Now let's see that we 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.220
 have a right angle about one 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.730
 right angle means that's the right one 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.590
 corner 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.140
 Right angle hess could be a leaf 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.950
 that's about it 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.040
 does not matter now it does not matter very much 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.100
 but so beautiful is the right values 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.920
 angle then I had a chance 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.360
 a right angle you can always 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.740
 Recognize that is a right 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.870
 angle here is the right angle animal 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.230
 so now we cut that out 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.740
 and promised aviators only once 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.860
 to click with it also a real one 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:25.010
 aviator will already click firmly 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:28.640
 straight lines so other side of course 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.840
 Also, other side just turn around 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.320
 same same height 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:39.020
 that means we are watching this too 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.780
 really both lie on each other like that and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.780
 that was already the derby no love 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.870
 so now the last explanation too 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.620
 the paper plane 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.470
 he is finished you can still beautiful 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.210
 a bit careful inside 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.670
 went off 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.660
 he is flying in magnifying glass 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:07.370
 about here with deaf and forefinger 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.810
 and then you just leave carefully 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.120
 You do not throw them that fast 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.180
 but rather slowly and then he goes 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.490
 immediately over a looping tried it out 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.490
 Have fun with it and a lot of success
