00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.759
 I want to show how I am at the party but 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:13.580
 the question is naked 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:18.140
 electro buildup and at 8 which mark 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.930
 horde no one on 8 I refused for the one 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.529
 the reason that you definitely need 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:30.829
 pull up on your usual not 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.030
 capcom can do without it here 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:37.510
 now I want to show how I am on your 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.510
 Russian frame 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:48.340
 234 know that it our for this 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 it is necessary to make such a table out of plywood 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.450
 to the points of water boiling on my stove 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.340
 boiling water boiling 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:09.159
 often at home or this one just put 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:15.850
 Wax's legs and then I do and 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.850
 frame for me and and 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.789
 Therefore, we cut off the edge 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 . I cut off 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 I bend the upper corner teaches 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.560
 Now I sat half my hair 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560
 here 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.950
 I can see that I have no wire 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.630
 absolutely 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 and, in principle, do not need them to stretch me 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.310
 pulled the school roller live 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.800
 strikes like this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.940
 on the boiler and rolled 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.050
 I put the buttons the buttons should in case 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.650
 if the mite does not build for long 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.420
 then excess wax is not necessary 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 so what do all these buttons take and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.600
 We use to provide here as the second 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.600
 here's the cover pull up and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 roller rolls 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:59.670
 five buttons on the edges along the herring and 3 more 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.849
 I have a sky frame on my hands 4 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.430
 wire 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.799
 dmitri glasses are done in order to 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.260
 pumping speed increase the more 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:16.079
 rows of wire the greater the speed at 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.079
 downloading but now also the world of daughters 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.859
 Vasilich use to she 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.079
 winter from she lay less warped and 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.739
 it is better 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:34.500
 tougher fresh can use 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:42.709
 but if there is a return sticking from 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:47.670
 cardboard patterns 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:51.590
 if spilled left them is not easy 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.590
 nowhere up I pulls up 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 here 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 that's not 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.350
 from necessity i save myself so 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.620
 way to constantly tighten the wire 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.260
 people take a very long time well 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
 Here is such a thing that's turned out here 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.520
 terns must be here empty and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.250
 so that it is not to 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.250
 rejoiced at his bottom you can still trim 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.580
 a little bit 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:33.490
 also so that there is a distance like this 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.400
 way now it remains to roll to 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.330
 the upper one 's this one to the top bar 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:47.100
 it means we take it like this 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.100
 here from this side of the story we 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.980
 here from this side 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.980
 so she didn't leave 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.969
 what have I got on the other side 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.830
 hold 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:08.310
 in the center of this roll so 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.310
 way 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.380
 here 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:23.810
 that's all here is the frame is ready statement 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:27.830

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.620
 stretched all the frame is ready this pair
