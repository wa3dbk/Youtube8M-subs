00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 a 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.420
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.520
 current video of handytarife.de us 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.219
 deal with the my way today 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.660
 essent w1 as it is easy here 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.190
 he can recognize I'll get the device 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.080
 now first from the packaging then 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.679
 Let's take a look 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.160
 more detailed to the windows phone measures 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.779
 125 x 64 x a good ten millimeters and weighs 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.650
 including the battery chance the same also 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.349
 a little closer 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.240
 well 130 grams so there we have it too 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.280
 open there is the battery that can be 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.350
 exchange the almost 1950's 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.110
 milliard hours and that is a whole 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.390
 decent battery Yes, the device sets up 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.120
 an ips display with 480 x 800 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.600
 picture points stop around 800 x 480 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.699
 picture points and that is not the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 class that is also clear to us 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.850
 a price of around 200 euros 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.590
 would like to anticipate in this point 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.309
 that's a pretty decent one 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.750
 equipment we get offered 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.370
 because now if we have the technical 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.210
 look at the data with little accuracy 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 we have one on 1 2 ghz 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.990
 clocked dual core processor of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.080
 Qualcomm in the housing stuck one 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.060
 snapdragon processor we have 512 mb 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.009
 RAM what in windows phone in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.070
 the eighth version is still sufficient 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.579
 and unfortunately only about 4 gb in total 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.290
 internal memory 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.479
 but this is to be considered as far as 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.700
 that and now I have to do it again 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.340
 open as well as a slot for 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.310
 micro sd cards then have up to 32 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.009
 gigabyte can be great while I am 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.750
 Now press this together again 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.000
 and slowly return to the menu 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.619
 the windows 8 surface in and of itself 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.689
 we already have them 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 other devices such as the 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.090
 about comparable windows phone 8 it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.570
 discussed in detail at htc 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 we can make the tiles different sizes 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.119
 arrange 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.840
 she knows it wrong, I think the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.439
 contacts tile has all three sizes 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 exactly 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.930
 For example, we have important new ones 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
 functions like the children's corner where 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.160
 one stops if one gets his 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.710
 children can adjust which can 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.870
 which programs used by children 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.180
 be allowed to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 but what compared to the first 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 Tests we with Windows phone devices 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.590
 What's new is that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.450
 nokia has opened a little and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.640
 for example, the card material for 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.680
 provides and allows for 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 now offline maps for all 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.680
 Manufacturer on windows phone 8 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.810
 want to set 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.340
 that is new that is good and thereby becomes 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 the device also in our view 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
 upgraded as we have a few 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.100
 once noted have the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.570
 interface to windows 8 computer 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.380
 or to the windows computer 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.210
 generally about not and of course about 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.470
 the office program via the office 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.020
 Programs also via sky drive 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.180
 then on the computer can retrieve 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.980
 after I've just been on maps 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.370
 maybe still have spoken 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
 in short a few words to the store we have 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.780
 Overall, I think good overall 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.140
 150 thousand apps for windows phone 8 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.580
 be available 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.620
 So now we see things like here 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.450
 evernote or runtastic pro i see 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.910
 small disadvantage has windows phone 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.430
 All in all yes I just think that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.290
 android and ios users faster with the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.280
 the newest are playing in the trend 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.260
 be supplied 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.350
 as that is now here at windows 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.390
 phone the case is deal with us 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.880
 The camera takes the recordings with up to 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.470
 5 megapixels on water from my sight 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.690
 completely sufficient in the smartphone area 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.090
 which I find much more interesting and that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.520
 has windows or microsoft yes 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.030
 to the first citizenship we made 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.850
 have the possibility the real or 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.070
 to use a physical trigger 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.710
 and the function has the charm that one 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.320
 Much faster and much more targeted mine 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.300
 can create one opinion, photos 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.240
 if we are in the mode here now 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.260
 I will be able to do videos 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.300
 briefly show a maximum of 720p so one 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.080
 recorded a small hd resolution 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.700
 the music player here on the homepage 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.350
 the success also after usual construction 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.360
 or media player becomes the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.919
 things are actually more fair we have 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.760
 here again the possibility of the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.700
 xbox music suits to book 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.290
 which one then yes on the device as well 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.250
 pretty extensive music archive 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.960
 can stream 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.270
 who his data rather offline on 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.860
 Want to play on the bottom sits 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.180
 the micro usb input and on the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.320
 the other side almost exactly opposite 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.750
 do we find the entrance in klinken 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.420
 Internet is that was it and how once 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.040
 the wlan hspa or edge on the way so 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.810
 in our case right now by wlan 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.450
 and the internet explorer the 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.550
 preinstalled the met in principle 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.380
 a really good job making me as 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.140
 what disturbed me in the test stop is 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.610
 that no bookmarks on his 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.890
 internet explorer on the computer 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.420
 can transfer 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.890
 the example of the hotmail account the 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.020
 I already have set up I want 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.820
 just go to the keyboard 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.100
 the layout was a bit screwed 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.140
 and there you can really high as 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.690
 even the phone held transversely 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.240
 That's why I'm typing that pretty well 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.340
 comma forget hello dear audience 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.540
 and that is going actually relatively 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.090
 quickly if you can write error-free 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.830
 also relatively fast yes I would say 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.960
 the e-mail administration succeeds 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.640
 the device also pretty good like 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.580
 the line can be all 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.930
 important mobile communication channels 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.640
 via the psn 21 summarize or 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.790
 rather, how to do it here 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.040
 now again briefly sees that was 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.080
 it fell in the p1 all around what we too 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.690
 with 409 out of five possible stars 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.490
 reward if you like the video 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.020
 We are happy about every abo what 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.770
 the permanent over our logo 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.540
 can conclude 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.940
 or you give us a thumbs up and 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.500
 which would have to be awarded down there 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.280
 Thanks for watching until the 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.280
 next time hahaha
