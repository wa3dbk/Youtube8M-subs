be best for me in the end I chose the
macbook<00:00:24.160> air<00:00:24.400> mainly<00:00:25.300> because<00:00:25.509> it's<00:00:25.990> so<00:00:26.199> light

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
macbook air mainly because it's so light

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.040 
macbook air mainly because it's so light
macbook<00:00:27.609> air<00:00:27.849> is<00:00:28.060> working<00:00:28.300> out<00:00:28.570> for<00:00:28.779> me<00:00:28.810> in

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
with this guy which is an external hard

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.870 
with this guy which is an external hard
drive<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.130> good<00:00:54.310> thing<00:00:54.520> about<00:00:54.550> running

drive and the good thing about running
out<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.150> storage<00:00:55.420> space<00:00:55.540> is<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.770> it<00:00:57.100> forces

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
out of storage space is that it forces

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.850 
out of storage space is that it forces
me<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.150> back<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:58.420> all<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.260> time<00:00:59.410> I'm<00:00:59.680> always

odna so I'm really back to what it

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350 
odna so I'm really back to what it
doesn't<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:02.650> is<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.040> disk<00:01:03.340> drive<00:01:03.460> being<00:01:04.269> in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.130 
for like two pennies everywhere and it
would<00:01:09.640> have<00:01:09.729> been<00:01:09.789> great<00:01:09.969> just<00:01:10.060> like<00:01:10.539> sliding

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
would have been great just like sliding

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.380 
would have been great just like sliding
discs<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.740> watching<00:01:12.039> movie<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:13.030> really<00:01:13.240> have

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
discs and watching movie you really have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.690 
discs and watching movie you really have
to<00:01:13.509> rely<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:14.009> downloading<00:01:15.009> movies<00:01:15.280> which

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
to rely on downloading movies which

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.730 
to rely on downloading movies which
again<00:01:16.329> I<00:01:16.390> don't<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.719> tons<00:01:16.929> of<00:01:17.020> space<00:01:17.229> for<00:01:17.499> so

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
again I don't have tons of space for so

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.709 
again I don't have tons of space for so
I<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:18.159> I<00:01:18.280> don't<00:01:18.399> actually<00:01:18.820> watch<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.479> lot<00:01:19.659> of

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
I just I don't actually watch a lot of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.749 
I just I don't actually watch a lot of
movies<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.469> my<00:01:20.499> computer<00:01:21.009> another<00:01:21.490> challenge

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
movies on my computer another challenge

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.300 
movies on my computer another challenge
is<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.299> it<00:01:22.450> doesn't<00:01:22.749> have<00:01:22.990> an<00:01:23.170> ethernet<00:01:23.380> plug

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
is that it doesn't have an ethernet plug

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.469 
is that it doesn't have an ethernet plug
in<00:01:24.609> it<00:01:24.850> has<00:01:25.450> only<00:01:25.719> USB<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.829> I<00:01:27.219> actually<00:01:27.520> opted

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
in it has only USB so I actually opted

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.559 
in it has only USB so I actually opted
to<00:01:28.630> purchase<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.200> USB<00:01:29.979> Ethernet<00:01:30.700> adapter<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.539> it

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
to purchase a USB Ethernet adapter so it

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.889 
to purchase a USB Ethernet adapter so it
takes<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:32.079> from<00:01:32.950> ethernet<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:33.909> goes<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.659> USB

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
takes it from ethernet and goes to USB

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.919 
takes it from ethernet and goes to USB
and<00:01:35.350> plugs<00:01:35.890> into<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:37.240> computer<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.689> that

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
and plugs into my computer and that

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.389 
and plugs into my computer and that
actually<00:01:38.289> saved<00:01:38.499> my<00:01:38.619> life<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.890> couple<00:01:38.920> times

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
actually saved my life a couple times

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.580 
actually saved my life a couple times
when<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:40.030> didn't<00:01:40.479> have<00:01:40.600> Wi-Fi<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:41.259> only

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
when I didn't have Wi-Fi but only

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.609 
when I didn't have Wi-Fi but only
Ethernet<00:01:42.009> available<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.030> don't<00:01:43.689> rely<00:01:43.929> on<00:01:44.109> just

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
Ethernet available so don't rely on just

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.309 
Ethernet available so don't rely on just
Wi-Fi<00:01:44.859> so<00:01:45.819> overall<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.329> macbook<00:01:46.659> air<00:01:46.840> has

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
Wi-Fi so overall the macbook air has

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.809 
Wi-Fi so overall the macbook air has
been<00:01:47.649> working<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.219> me<00:01:48.340> there's<00:01:48.579> been<00:01:48.789> a

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
been working for me there's been a

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.849 
been working for me there's been a
couple<00:01:49.060> challenges<00:01:49.659> but<00:01:50.079> like<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.350> say<00:01:50.560> some<00:01:50.740> of

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
couple challenges but like I say some of

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.190 
couple challenges but like I say some of
these<00:01:50.920> challenges<00:01:50.979> such<00:01:51.639> as<00:01:51.929> storage<00:01:52.929> space

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
these challenges such as storage space

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.889 
these challenges such as storage space
turn<00:01:53.530> into<00:01:53.889> a<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:54.249> thing<00:01:54.460> we're<00:01:54.819> unforced<00:01:55.569> to

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899
