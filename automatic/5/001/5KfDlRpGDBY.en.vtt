to<00:01:00.570> describe<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.230> looks<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to describe what this looks like is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.639 
to describe what this looks like is
imagine<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.239> two<00:01:03.899> pieces<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.379> wood

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
imagine if you have two pieces of wood

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.010 
imagine if you have two pieces of wood
you<00:01:04.920> put<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.460> piece<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.940> what<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.600> table

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you put one piece of what on your table

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
you put one piece of what on your table
you<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.710> piece<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.100> wood<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.310> top<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you put other piece of wood on top of it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
you put other piece of wood on top of it
and<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> top<00:01:10.020> piece<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.380> wood<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and you take that top piece of wood and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
and you take that top piece of wood and
you<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> slide<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:11.909> bit

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you just slide it back a little bit

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
you just slide it back a little bit
that's<00:01:12.690> pretty<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.940> ps3<00:01:14.940> ps4

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that's pretty much what the ps3 ps4

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.600 
that's pretty much what the ps3 ps4
looks<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> space<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
looks like and it's a space in the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
looks like and it's a space in the
middle<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.210> guessing<00:01:18.780> where<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> put

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
middle I'm guessing where you can put

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.090 
middle I'm guessing where you can put
the<00:01:19.560> disc<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.900> maybe<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.170> USB<00:01:22.560> ports<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the disc and maybe some USB ports we

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
the disc and maybe some USB ports we
didn't<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.510> good<00:01:24.540> look<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
didn't really get a really good look of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.680 
didn't really get a really good look of
it<00:01:25.200> they'll<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.250> only<00:01:26.400> had<00:01:26.729> some

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
it they'll do they only had some

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.480 
it they'll do they only had some
pictures<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.500> screens<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.190> he<00:01:29.340> was

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
pictures up on the screens and he was

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
pictures up on the screens and he was
holding<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.650> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
holding it like this and it was not it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
holding it like this and it was not it
was<00:01:31.920> pretty<00:01:32.220> hard<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.580> see<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.030> overall<00:01:33.780> like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
was pretty hard to see but overall like

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.050 
was pretty hard to see but overall like
I<00:01:34.260> said<00:01:34.439> beginning<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.979> video<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.670> design

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I said beginning the video the design

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
I said beginning the video the design
