devices but I believe that there are two

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.560 
devices but I believe that there are two
of<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.630> most<00:02:47.780> common<00:02:48.380> mistakes<00:02:48.920> that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
of the most common mistakes that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.150 
of the most common mistakes that

Christians make concerning Satan and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.450 
Christians make concerning Satan and
they<00:02:52.700> are<00:02:52.880> based<00:02:53.210> upon<00:02:53.450> two<00:02:54.250> methods<00:02:55.250> or

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
they are based upon two methods or

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.980 
they are based upon two methods or
devices<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.090> he<00:02:56.450> employs

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
devices that he employs

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.160 
devices that he employs
there<00:02:57.950> are<00:02:58.100> at<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.580> two<00:02:58.850> opposite<00:02:59.810> ends<00:03:00.080> of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
there are at the two opposite ends of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.760 
there are at the two opposite ends of
the<00:03:00.230> spectrum<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.760> first<00:03:02.090> one<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.770> he

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
the spectrum and the first one is he

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.730 
the spectrum and the first one is he
basically<00:03:04.490> he<00:03:05.120> gets<00:03:05.360> Christians<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.110> act<00:03:06.380> as

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
basically he gets Christians to act as

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.480 
basically he gets Christians to act as
if<00:03:07.490> he<00:03:07.640> doesn't<00:03:07.820> exist<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:10.070> know<00:03:10.130> there's<00:03:10.400> a
