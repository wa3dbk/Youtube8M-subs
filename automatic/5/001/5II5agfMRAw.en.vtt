00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
doing it's kind of hard to record her

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.529 
doing it's kind of hard to record her
now<00:00:23.259> because<00:00:23.949> she<00:00:24.340> is<00:00:24.550> in<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.000> dementia<00:00:25.509> unit

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
now because she is in the dementia unit

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.650 
now because she is in the dementia unit
and<00:00:26.109> it's<00:00:27.039> hard<00:00:27.339> not<00:00:27.609> to<00:00:27.640> get<00:00:27.910> other<00:00:28.119> people<00:00:28.509> in

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
and it's hard not to get other people in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.999 
and it's hard not to get other people in
there<00:00:28.810> too<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.289> I<00:00:29.380> don't<00:00:29.529> think<00:00:29.740> they<00:00:29.890> would

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
there too and I don't think they would

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.490
