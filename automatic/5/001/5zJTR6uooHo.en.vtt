mini<00:01:21.360> price<00:01:21.689> fix<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.470> risky<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.009> do

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
mini price fix this is very risky to do

I'm<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.799> more<00:01:32.159> looking<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> potential<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I'm I'm more looking at the potential in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
I'm I'm more looking at the potential in
the<00:01:33.630> profit<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> make<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> bought<00:01:35.189> both

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the profit I can make so I bought both

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
the profit I can make so I bought both
of<00:01:35.549> them<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:35.850> 3500<00:01:36.630> coins<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.320> 5000

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of them one for 3500 coins one for 5000

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
of them one for 3500 coins one for 5000
coins<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.340> only<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> market

I really doubt this one sales but I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
I really doubt this one sales but I
think<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> first<00:02:21.209> one<00:02:21.360> will<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
think the first one will and if the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.870 
think the first one will and if the
first<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:22.530> does<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> already<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.670> made

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
first one does so I already have made

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000 
first one does so I already have made
profit<00:02:24.420> from<00:02:24.870> buying<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.470> cards<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
profit from buying the two cards a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.970 
profit from buying the two cards a
little<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.730> risky<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.530> mini<00:02:28.709> price

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
little bit risky but it's a mini price

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
collections put them up because their

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.870

some<00:02:58.350> people<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.950> hobby<00:02:59.550> that's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
some people just have a hobby that's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.490 
some people just have a hobby that's
what<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.780> do<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> lockin<00:03:01.290> team<00:03:01.380> which

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
what they like to do a lockin team which

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.009 
what they like to do a lockin team which
is<00:03:01.620> cool<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.070> no<00:03:02.190> problem<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.610> know

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
is cool it's no problem you know

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.940 
is cool it's no problem you know
personally<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.080> don't<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> rewards<00:03:04.860> are

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
personally I don't think the rewards are

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.140 
personally I don't think the rewards are
worth<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.519> what<00:03:05.640> I've<00:03:05.730> been<00:03:05.880> hearing

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
worth it that's what I've been hearing

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.140 
worth it that's what I've been hearing
and<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.920> collection<00:03:08.459> these<00:03:08.880> collections

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and so this collection these collections

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
and so this collection these collections
aren't<00:03:09.510> necessary<00:03:09.870> worth<00:03:10.140> doing<00:03:10.380> for<00:03:10.620> me<00:03:10.680> but

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
aren't necessary worth doing for me but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.199 
aren't necessary worth doing for me but
later<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> year<00:03:11.459> there<00:03:11.700> probably<00:03:12.000> will

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
later on in the year there probably will
