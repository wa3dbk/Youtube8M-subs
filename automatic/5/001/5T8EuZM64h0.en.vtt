00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.110
 researchers from the cetene center for strategic technologies of the northeast 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.730
 are improving the sugarcane cultivated in the zone of the forest of pernambuco 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.520
 the tests so far indicated that there will be higher productivity of sugar cane 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.009
 region 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.429
 It's like a maternity ward. 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.609
 where newborns are the small plants 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.880
 is the bio-factory of the Ministry of Science and Technology created two 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.480
 years on the reef 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 the objective is to produce in large quantities seedlings of improved sugarcane 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.470
 genetically 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.290
 they grow with a lot of art that if OPEC has everything from videos in a mix of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.140
 nutrients and hormones 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 is a stimulus to generate clones of themselves 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.160
 after 15 days at least five new seedlings have already emerged from a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.940
 and has to be gently separated 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.100
 this other method of cultivation 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.010
 increases productivity by 20% 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.220
 the seedlings were for a time immersed in the water full of nutrients 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.390
 every month 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 the biofactory produces one and a half million seedlings of six cane varieties 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.530
 are the result of genetic research by eight universities 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 Brazilian companies have high productivity 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.410
 and election 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.750
 the post things internally in your understand the religious culture or not the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 cane seedlings produced in the biofactory 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.220
 are already being planted in cultivated areas in the region of the southern forest zone 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.770
 of pernambuco but before being taken to the field they go through a period of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 two months of adaptation to the environment what is done in greenhouses like this six 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 rapes have already been built 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.439
 within the area of ​​a rural settlement in the municipality of catende 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.620
 is that of a cooperative with two thousand and eight hundred workers 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.930
 control of the machinery of a sugarcane mill 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 already started strong from the first reeds produced factory ship 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.400
 the yield it makes has been higher than the average region average the screens 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.930
 quinas pmdb other varieties reach the average of 70 tons per hectare 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.350
 that square of the red cross 10 130 tons per small hectare 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.959
 Pernambuco Producers 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.379
 will have access to the seedlings for a price well below market 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:26.229
 but for this I still have to build more I'm going to adapt the plants 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.239
 to the countryside 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.469
 we have a goal in relation to the ambitious 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.289
 because we want to distribute naturally distribute 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.289
 organized the best way of the world in the year 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:45.049
 is that it allows you to change is that it is able to change the features of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.339
 the entire region of the forest zone
