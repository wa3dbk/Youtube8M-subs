00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
really good value whereas Brandin cooks

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.000 
really good value whereas Brandin cooks
was<00:03:43.330> easily<00:03:43.630> their<00:03:43.900> best<00:03:44.170> pic<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.650> think<00:03:44.980> I

was easily their best pic I think I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.170 
was easily their best pic I think I

this guy to stay healthy I think he's a

Kerry for getting him in round number
four<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> think<00:04:04.900> he's<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.260> guy<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.410> could<00:04:05.650> step

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
four I think he's a guy that could step

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.620

in<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.100> contribute<00:04:06.550> almost<00:04:06.850> immediately<00:04:07.330> I

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
in and contribute almost immediately I

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.870 
in and contribute almost immediately I
think<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.140> innocence<00:04:08.560> Erie<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:09.130> guy<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.850> you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
think of innocence Erie a guy that you

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.400 
think of innocence Erie a guy that you
know<00:04:10.120> might<00:04:10.360> end<00:04:10.540> up<00:04:10.600> redshirting<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:11.230> good

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.189 
guess maybe the fact that they didn't
get<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.699> big<00:04:36.030> physical<00:04:36.330> wide<00:04:36.780> receiver

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
get a big physical wide receiver

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.390 
get a big physical wide receiver
something<00:04:37.590> i<00:04:37.680> think<00:04:37.740> that's<00:04:38.069> been<00:04:38.220> missing

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
something i think that's been missing

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.270 
something i think that's been missing
from<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.819> Saints<00:04:39.150> offense<00:04:39.270> for<00:04:39.870> years<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.650> was

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
from the Saints offense for years I was

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.589 
from the Saints offense for years I was
a<00:04:41.310> little<00:04:41.580> surprised<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.060> see<00:04:42.210> them<00:04:42.360> wait

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
a little surprised to see them wait

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.540 
a little surprised to see them wait
until<00:04:42.930> round<00:04:43.169> number<00:04:43.500> six<00:04:43.740> To<00:04:43.919> Go<00:04:43.949> address

offensive tackle and outside linebacker

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.399 
offensive tackle and outside linebacker
I<00:04:47.490> thought<00:04:47.789> you<00:04:48.000> needed<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.449> get<00:04:48.840> more<00:04:49.139> help

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
I thought you needed to get more help

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.159 
I thought you needed to get more help
for<00:04:49.770> Drew<00:04:50.430> Brees<00:04:50.610> up<00:04:50.970> front<00:04:51.389> on<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.780> offensive

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
for Drew Brees up front on the offensive

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.200 
for Drew Brees up front on the offensive
line<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:52.830> they<00:04:52.949> definitely<00:04:53.370> needed<00:04:53.819> another

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
line and they definitely needed another

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.640 
line and they definitely needed another
edge<00:04:54.509> rush<00:04:54.750> which<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.110> can<00:04:55.229> always<00:04:55.470> have<00:04:55.620> more

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
edge rush which you can always have more

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.559 
edge rush which you can always have more
of<00:04:55.889> those<00:04:56.039> I<00:04:56.220> suppose<00:04:56.580> when<00:04:57.150> you're<00:04:57.270> running<00:04:57.419> a

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
of those I suppose when you're running a

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.990 
of those I suppose when you're running a
3-4<00:04:58.020> defense<00:04:58.440> like<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:58.949> said<00:04:59.099> overall<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.819> was<00:04:59.969> a

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
3-4 defense like I said overall it was a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.119 
3-4 defense like I said overall it was a
solid<00:05:00.419> draft<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.349> New<00:05:01.590> Orleans<00:05:01.979> Saints

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
solid draft for the New Orleans Saints

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.430 
solid draft for the New Orleans Saints
it<00:05:02.340> wasn't<00:05:02.669> spectacular<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:04.020> know<00:05:04.110> Stanley

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
it wasn't spectacular you know Stanley

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.499 
it wasn't spectacular you know Stanley
jean-baptiste<00:05:04.759> might<00:05:05.759> not<00:05:05.969> be<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.180> guy<00:05:06.360> that

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
jean-baptiste might not be a guy that

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.059 
jean-baptiste might not be a guy that

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
contributes a whole lot as a rookie so

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.920 
contributes a whole lot as a rookie so
it<00:05:08.159> might<00:05:08.310> take<00:05:08.520> him<00:05:08.639> some<00:05:08.879> time<00:05:08.909> but<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.780> guy

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
it might take him some time but a guy

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.600 
it might take him some time but a guy
