00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.760
 United 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.760
 One day a week 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 if your child 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 on Tuesday they wanted and very strange 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.929
 It has to be a virus followed by the United States 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.479
 yesterday I am not even very happy here it is seen that it is unfair 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 when I boot the hard drive this is what it looked like 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.590
 they're stuck in Kentucky missions are all out 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.100
 but a test his thorns 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.129
 the question is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.129
 how much they were watching and they were watching me 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 stars 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.050
 they keep out 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.230
 and if ours 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.450
 two of them 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 establishing a connection 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.730
 dish and its rules 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.880
 outside of our 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 and if our life 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 julian we did 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.830
 that's what I would do in the bathroom 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830
 and the documents 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.400
 as if they were here forever 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 we have found frequencies that we did not even know existed 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 I do not understand everything 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 it was expected 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550
 kirk 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.550
 and without certain news 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.209
