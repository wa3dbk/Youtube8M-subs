00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
that's what it is I can't imagine how an

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
imagine how there could be such a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.680 
imagine how there could be such a

lives and then what they choose to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.740 
lives and then what they choose to
express<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.290> one<00:03:21.500> bed<00:03:21.739> series<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.750> a

express so that in one bed series is a
kind<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:25.660> sin<00:03:26.660> autobiography<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.880> in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
kind of a sin autobiography and it in

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.840 
kind of a sin autobiography and it in
bronze<00:03:30.520> which<00:03:31.520> is<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.760> very<00:03:33.310> permanent<00:03:34.310> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
very solid material so that was my goal
