00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.540
 hello youtube friends today les 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:11.990
 we will teach how to make a cover of a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.620
 city ​​is very easy the truth 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.650
 I do it with publishers no but 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.820
 at this time we will make public 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.820
 we go to all the programs 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 and police 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.980
 here many options will come but not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 comes none I decided so we look 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.590
 here we put 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590
 city 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.640
 we wait for him to look 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 I searched 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.079
 good 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.620
 already came out several options these are 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.880
 already made discs 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.100
 but here are several video measurements of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.680
 discs with 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.990
 cover as you want me to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.990
 example I'm going to choose this standard 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.700
 of the main good since we are 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.860
 here this is just trying the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.150
 image that you want because of the disc 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.150
 for example 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.950
 I will put this image that is the only 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950
 that I have 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.590
 and I have it here 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.960
 to the maximum so that it reaches to cover everything 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 one thing here I'm very big but 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.130
 obviously been the first bazaar the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.040
 size of a disc not so big 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 because he already has that doubt 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.180
 if you put the size of the disk you put 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.140
 here because the disc is put 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.510
 and you already have your disk but the thing when 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.420
 print this little circle does not come out and so 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.800
 so as not to risk a lot of not remembering 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.290
 where it is not 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.510
 I like them here in the form they put a 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.760
 circle like this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.760
 then they can exactly where they are going 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 good 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.030
 for something like that moment of a moment of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.190
 print what is going to come out of this 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.920
 circle so you know 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.370
 where is the center of the disk since what 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.930
 you can remember 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.599
 goes well 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.200
 and well that's all for today I hope that 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.200
 I have served you 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.560
 all Yes
