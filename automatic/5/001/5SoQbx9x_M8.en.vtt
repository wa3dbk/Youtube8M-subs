00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a dime audible p.m. so I was thinking

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
a dime audible p.m. so I was thinking
I'd<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.160> something<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> off

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I'd really like something just it to off

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
I'd really like something just it to off
on<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.300> shelf<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.989> add<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
on my shelf and add it into the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
on my shelf and add it into the
collection<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.210> huge<00:01:03.390> fan<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
collection because I'm a huge fan of the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.530 
collection because I'm a huge fan of the
game<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> it'd<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.700> nice<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.270> an

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
game and it'd just be nice to have an

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.710 
game and it'd just be nice to have an
actual<00:01:07.110> box<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.950> display<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> shelf

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
actual box to display on the shelf

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.899 
actual box to display on the shelf
so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.110> thinking<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.460> an<00:01:11.580> eighties

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so I was thinking well it's an eighties

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.249 
so I was thinking well it's an eighties
nineties<00:01:12.420> inspired<00:01:13.070> game<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.549> why<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.880> make<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
nineties inspired game so why not make a

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.499 
nineties inspired game so why not make a
Mega<00:01:16.259> Drive<00:01:16.560> case<00:01:16.890> alright<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.580> my

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
Mega Drive case alright just my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.469 
Mega Drive case alright just my
imagination<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.770> how<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.270> look

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
imagination of how the game would look

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
imagination of how the game would look
if<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.810> ever<00:01:21.990> released<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> Mega

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if it was ever released in the Mega

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
if it was ever released in the Mega
Drive<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> came<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
Drive so this is what I came up with I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340 
Drive so this is what I came up with I
went<00:01:25.470> online<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.780> basically<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
went online and basically had a look for

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
went online and basically had a look for
all<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> different<00:01:28.920> images<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.310> our<00:01:30.150> tech

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
all the different images and our tech

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
all the different images and our tech
needs<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.829> found<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.549> template<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
needs actually found a template which I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.649 
needs actually found a template which I
use<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.140> almost<00:01:34.560> pacing<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.240> came<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.630> with

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
use for almost pacing and I came up with

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090 
use for almost pacing and I came up with
us<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> think<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> turned<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.860> working

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
us and I think it turned out working

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
us and I think it turned out working
very<00:01:38.790> nice<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.360> they're<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.659> you've
