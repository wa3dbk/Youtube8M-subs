00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello people we'll do it again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.799
 Flammkuchen with goat cheese grape was 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 some few onions cheese Schmandt 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:25.260
 the direction we already have two 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 Recipes in the block of classic elders 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.890
 and the vegan tarte flambÃ©e 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 classic parent alaska is already 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.600
 calling at the vegan make at the end in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.649
 a car 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.989
 we also have the dough 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.730
 prepare some spelled flour warm 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.620
 water oil and salt 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 and they, too , those two 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 videos here is really made 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.989
 I always have something that always rules me 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.640
 you can you can take things one 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.670
 Perfectly your neighbor can do me 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.920
 The basic principle remains that way 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 of course, the other ingredients 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 we have goat cheese with their onions 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.399
 we have white grapes all over cheese 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.260
 to the platinum her some olive oil and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.229
 naturally salt pepper 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.369
 clearly a bit more roll out 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:24.390
 First we cut the leeks onions 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:26.400
 because the trains we have two 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 possibilities once we roast them 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 the other side is if you like that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.060
 has cut thin now then goes to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.610
 the simple bowl once that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.939
 fry the shit shorten look something 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.310
 pepper always black from the mill 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.850
 some salt and a small piece 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 olive oil really just a mouthful and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.110
 let's discrete that 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.830
 both are very fine here you can see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.160
 also very nice there we can on it 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.160
 lay 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.060
 Now you want to do the dough out for like 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.180
 always put some flour on the work surface 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:27.050
 Also that I use the spelled flour cake dough 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:32.910
 he has now rested an hour quarter 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.800
 recipe is the recipe of the vegan 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.300
 Flammkuchen that we on the 500 grams 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.300
 flour the other recipes slightly smaller 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.750
 the prescription you know so well now 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.500
 finds in the infobox is at the link 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.600
 to homepage 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.270
 there are a few additional details 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:03:01.530
 it little bit of info around 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:03.600
 Recipe flammkuchen 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.010
 I'm coming not worried about 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.049
 It should not be perfect beauty 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 his is placed quite rustic, the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.340
 can also look quite rustic that 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.910
 you just look like he's throwing too 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.920
 blow 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.470
 even that is a sign enough rested 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.470
 should be possible 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.690
 the gaps are simply there 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.310
 not too easy 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.620
 straightforward that's a dish that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.370
 Country dish quite uncomplicated thing 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.370
 as well as a pizza italy case management 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.750
 I take some cream 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:49.850
 fraiche with milk but commerce kallio 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.010
 and I just learned it that way 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.170
 you with quite a lot of things that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.230
 every village sometimes every family you 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.940
 own recipe has how to do it 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.660
 your own trick of your own 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.470
 It's important to have some ideas 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.720
 always that it tastes and tastes so 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:15.560
 is all spread out really nice 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:22.250
 not too fat then it will me 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:30.440
 whole very light with salt black day 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:33.490
 more do not call his yet again 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.490
 too much purchase 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.849
 but also nicely distributed the nuts 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.140
 important that they are not down 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.170
 come that the same cheese covered 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:05:03.470
 they just will not 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:05:05.570
 burn added grape small places you 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.900
 quite as big as the cheap one once 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.900
 bisect 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.100
 he fits very well, for example 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.100
 on it you cut very thinly 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.160
 or with a caramelized pear 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:41.720
 is also delicious on the come 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.720
 goat cheese a bit greener the 8 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.250
 make the smaller pieces it very much 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.250
 strong on intense cream cheese 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.380
 but there you go in measure of 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.860
 especially when you have people to visit 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.340
 this strong taste not at all 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.340
 are used to 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:14.940
 and then they drive with covers and 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.840
 then I really clean in hot oven 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.310
 have now preheated to 22 degrees 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.960
 the flammkuchen do so around ten 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.480
 minutes at 220 degrees in it 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.830
 that's what he looks like now we're completing that 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.830
 still with a bit of fresh thyme 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.990
 just so grilled freshness quite nice 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.020
 Sounds so wonderfully easy 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.610
 subtract a bit 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.530
 between eaves dollars 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.320
 of course, this includes a wine glass I 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.960
 seen but a lecture great fits 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.669
 of course also or grape juice world 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.350
 adventure acts beat announces runs 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:06.060
 now down here the vegan velvet 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:08.300
 I'll show them here and that 's me 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.300
 taste 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.680
 means delicious more
