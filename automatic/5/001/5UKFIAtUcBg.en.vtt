00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.629
 they see it really works I think it's 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 a society in which I am going to continue 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.860
 working little by little and we go more or 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 less about the products that I buy 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.470
 with much desire and I want to see if 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.289
 work or not is a wave spray 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 you overcome this is from av if you know that to me 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.939
 I really like this brand as well as 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.400
 I want to take it then he took out the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.180
 super wave spray that then I have 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.510
 said agree let's try it 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.450
 I know there are others different but 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.270
 much more expensive then how do not 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.960
 and I bought it for 699 and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.920
 we are living and we are going to what matters 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.510
 I already have my hair for man 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.000
 every day that we have washed and already 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.699
 is to wash out a little bit what 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.160
 which is in this part talcum powder I 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.860
 I do not use dry shampoo though powders of 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 talc because it's the same so that I 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.430
 it absorbs a little fat and good I 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.580
 what I 've seen is that this shampoo does not 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.890
 you know your shampoo this prime and you have to 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.880
 catch by catching small 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.880
 exemptions 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.039
 pulverizing 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 and how 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.980
 how doing 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:41.520
 as well as crushing it so 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:48.570
 say it to make you what is the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 Ortega waves then let's see it 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 ah 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.600
 good this degree like three minutes and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.190
 half in this half of the head is a 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.840
 little bit wet and that I guess it 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.680
 it has to dry 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.680
 so that I 'm going to do this part 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.370
 it has become quite strong although I 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.370
 I just wet the whole ear 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:03.100
 you also have to tell a story that I 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:07.750
 for example I almost nothing nothing of layers 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.580
 these things that give a lot of place when 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.580
 you get to the older person is capable 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.290
 then power let's try it and if not 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.290
 I cut myself 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.510
 my hair is a pretty fine hair 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:33.769
 modular but purpose 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.769
 very very fine and straight with the one that more 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.080
 but I'll be like this until it dries 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.110
 because so little in that house is a 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.560
 little bit humid but I guess it has 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.560
 to be here 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.000
 ah 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.720
 it's been ten minutes since 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.879
 eight plates and I think I've spent 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.520
 with everything I've thrown out because 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:42.870
 I still do not have a tad wet and 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.270
 note that the entourage immediately 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.990
 because they carry alcohol as a second 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.220
 ingredient but good also takes a 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:00.389
 oil and things so they counteract the 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.389
 alcohol then that the result 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.690
 Well the one that is boiling a little 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.450
 I do not know I like my hair tousled and 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.400
 things like that but of course that depends 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.530
 because to me many times when I go 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.050
 with my hair people come to me says it is 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:24.100
 that you are combing me and if yes I have 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.909
 combed and that's what he has put on but hey 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.469
 it is for tastes colors 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.800
 I've seen videos of girls who have 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:37.509
 long hair with layers and curls 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.430
 incredible I do not know if it is that they 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.430
 they have put the smile 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.490
 when nobody was watching happened to the 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.789
 Iron the challenge of the officer 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.849
 I do not know me does not make me curls you 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.080
 you shit a lot less to the boots makes me 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.430
 waves 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.710
 What did I really expect? 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.689
 I would not expect some curls very 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.180
 marked but I guess there are people who 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:08.250
 He has curly hair because he was left with a 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.759
 pela with pulo pulo I my sister in law goes 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.919
 to use just because like the boats that I have 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.710
 bought is for her and she already has her hair 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.849
 Curly has wavy hair but 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.849
 when it has been like this 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.910
 and that I like the result to 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.910
 you 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.290
 His neighbor 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.660
 you no longer have to use iron at all 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.660
 of that is hair it shows a little 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.310
 a little 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.100
 it does not feel soft that we say you do not notice 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.240
 that is bad it feels like dirty 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.130
 waters 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.130
 if I do as dirty 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.170
 the waves will not go by then I have 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.310
 to go to work if I see that I have the 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.310
 hair very badly as I will 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.150
 I simply wanted first impressions and 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.000
 Well, if I like it, they will come to a video 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.930
 of favorites and if not then I'll say it 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.200

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.410
