00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
actually to the north now this is all a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually to the north now this is all a

pressure<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.020> call

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pressure up here this is what we call

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
pressure up here this is what we call
that<00:01:49.229> subtropical<00:01:49.829> Ridge<00:01:50.280> rate<00:01:50.579> all<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> way

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that subtropical Ridge rate all the way

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399 
that subtropical Ridge rate all the way
through<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
through here and this is not going to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.080 
through here and this is not going to
keep<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.799> system<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> South<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
keep the system to the South I like to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.569 
keep the system to the South I like to
think<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> tropicals<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> basically<00:01:56.219> water

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
think of a tropicals as basically water

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.039 
think of a tropicals as basically water
wanting<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> run<00:01:57.240> downhill<00:01:57.509> they're<00:01:57.930> not

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
wanting to run downhill they're not

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
wanting to run downhill they're not
going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> run<00:01:58.380> uphill<00:01:58.649> towards<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.399> higher

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going to run uphill towards a higher

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
going to run uphill towards a higher
ground<00:02:00.119> basically<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.290> called<00:02:01.649> higher

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
ground basically which we called higher

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.160 
ground basically which we called higher
pressure<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:03.090> something<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.479> note<00:02:03.960> here

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
pressure so just something to note here

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.840 
pressure so just something to note here
and<00:02:04.409> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:05.100> thumb<00:02:05.310> rule<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> file

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and kind of a good thumb rule the file

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
and kind of a good thumb rule the file
when<00:02:06.030> you're<00:02:06.119> forecasting<00:02:06.380> tropical<00:02:07.380> storms

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
when you're forecasting tropical storms

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.639 
when you're forecasting tropical storms
I'm<00:02:08.220> actually<00:02:08.369> looking<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:09.030> 15<00:02:09.300> w<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
I'm actually looking at 15 w here the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.830 
I'm actually looking at 15 w here the
overall<00:02:11.120> organization<00:02:12.120> alice<00:02:12.360> system<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
overall organization alice system is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.440 
overall organization alice system is
much<00:02:13.110> better

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
much better

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570 
much better
today<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.989> have<00:02:14.230> more<00:02:14.520> organization<00:02:15.520> on

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
today we have more organization on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.940 
today we have more organization on
northern<00:02:16.060> periphery<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.020> tropical

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
northern periphery as this tropical

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.770 
northern periphery as this tropical
trough<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.459> farther<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.030> north<00:02:19.150> has<00:02:19.569> led

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
trough up farther to the north has led

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.270 
trough up farther to the north has led
up<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.019> little<00:02:20.230> bit<00:02:20.349> with<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.650> Ridge<00:02:20.860> building

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
up a little bit with that Ridge building

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.369 
up a little bit with that Ridge building
in<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:22.180> given<00:02:22.480> more<00:02:22.690> exhaust<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.319> the

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
in so this given more exhaust in the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.589 
in so this given more exhaust in the
upper<00:02:23.620> levels<00:02:23.950> more<00:02:24.190> anti<00:02:24.489> cyclonic<00:02:24.940> rotation

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
upper levels more anti cyclonic rotation

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.660 
upper levels more anti cyclonic rotation
and<00:02:25.810> overall<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.620> much<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:27.069> outflow<00:02:27.550> in

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and overall we have much more outflow in

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.280 
and overall we have much more outflow in
the<00:02:27.760> northern<00:02:28.090> periphery<00:02:28.360> still<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> good

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the northern periphery still have a good

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.900 
the northern periphery still have a good
equatorial<00:02:30.010> over<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> southern<00:02:30.580> periphery

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
equatorial over the southern periphery

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.759 
equatorial over the southern periphery
and<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.540> little<00:02:31.780> bit<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> dryer<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and a little bit of dryer out to the

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.380 
and a little bit of dryer out to the
northwest<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.580> looks<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.030> starting

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
northwest but this looks like a starting

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
northwest but this looks like a starting
actually<00:02:34.690> led<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.500> system<00:02:35.860> moves<00:02:36.099> off

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
actually led up of this system moves off

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.400 
actually led up of this system moves off
towards<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.610> west<00:02:37.000> right<00:02:37.300> now<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:38.319> in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
towards the west right now I'm in

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.199 
towards the west right now I'm in
zooming<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.980> microwave<00:02:39.459> imagery<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.060> we

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
zooming in on microwave imagery here we

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.460 
zooming in on microwave imagery here we
still<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.599> see<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.930> bit<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.200> dryer

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
still can see a little bit of a dryer

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.990 
still can see a little bit of a dryer
out<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.950> northwest<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:42.610> overall

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
out to the northwest but overall

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.059 
out to the northwest but overall
organization<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.049> circulation<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.830> this

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069

organization is circulation on this
system<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.610> much<00:02:46.239> better<00:02:46.269> today<00:02:46.930> than<00:02:47.049> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
system is a much better today than it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.070 
system is a much better today than it
was<00:02:47.440> yesterday<00:02:47.640> here<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:48.880> also<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.660> can

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
was yesterday here so also we can can

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.390 
was yesterday here so also we can can
see<00:02:50.230> an<00:02:50.319> eye<00:02:50.440> wall<00:02:50.680> forming<00:02:51.040> great<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.370> in

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
see an eye wall forming great here in

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.770 
see an eye wall forming great here in
the<00:02:51.459> northern<00:02:51.819> periphery<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.360> as<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.660> get

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
the northern periphery and as we get

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.660 
the northern periphery and as we get
some<00:02:53.019> newer<00:02:53.230> microwave<00:02:53.799> imager<00:02:53.980> easier<00:02:54.489> will

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
some newer microwave imager easier will

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.210 
some newer microwave imager easier will
definitely<00:02:55.120> probably<00:02:55.299> see<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:56.069> definite<00:02:57.069> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220

Hainan actually needs the watch is

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.259 
Hainan actually needs the watch is

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
likely going to recurve after it moves

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.180 
likely going to recurve after it moves
over<00:03:31.480> Luzon<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.230> right<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.590> though<00:03:32.889> it<00:03:33.010> looks

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
over Luzon but right now though it looks

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.199 
over Luzon but right now though it looks
like<00:03:33.340> it's<00:03:33.459> actually<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.850> head<00:03:33.970> towards

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
like it's actually in a head towards

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.479 
like it's actually in a head towards
that<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> another<00:03:35.709> model<00:03:36.010> gfs

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
landfall along northern Luzon as well so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.539 
landfall along northern Luzon as well so
only<00:03:43.450> other<00:03:43.690> one<00:03:43.959> model<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.560> no<00:03:44.980> gaps<00:03:45.220> model

only other one model the no gaps model
not<00:03:45.639> going<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.819> show<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.239> buddy<00:03:46.480> that's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
not going to show it to you buddy that's

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.569 
not going to show it to you buddy that's
actually<00:03:47.079> showing<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.590> recurve<00:03:48.069> here<00:03:48.400> up

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
actually showing a recurve here up

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.819 
actually showing a recurve here up
towards<00:03:48.959> Okinawa<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.109> eventually<00:03:50.530> up<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
towards Okinawa and eventually up to

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.650 
towards Okinawa and eventually up to
Japan<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.519> model<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> little<00:03:52.269> off<00:03:52.420> here

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
Japan that model is a little off here

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.780 
Japan that model is a little off here
showing<00:03:52.959> actually<00:03:53.350> more<00:03:53.530> weakness<00:03:53.769> in<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
showing actually more weakness in the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.629 
showing actually more weakness in the
original<00:03:55.180> or<00:03:55.959> troughing<00:03:56.530> coming<00:03:57.040> down<00:03:57.280> so

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
original or troughing coming down so

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.270 
original or troughing coming down so
right<00:03:58.569> now<00:03:58.599> though<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.170> consensus<00:03:59.739> basically

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
right now though the consensus basically

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.670 
right now though the consensus basically
is<00:04:00.430> heading<00:04:00.790> towards<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.180> northern<00:04:02.109> luzon<00:04:02.440> here

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
is heading towards a northern luzon here

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.170 
is heading towards a northern luzon here
and<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:02.920> basically<00:04:03.130> builds<00:04:03.849> up<00:04:03.970> with

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and that basically builds up with

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.789 
and that basically builds up with
streamline<00:04:04.900> analysis<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.590> upper-level

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
streamline analysis and upper-level

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.129 
streamline analysis and upper-level
charts<00:04:06.280> as<00:04:06.430> well<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.910> this<00:04:07.720> is<00:04:07.930> definitely

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
charts as well so this is definitely

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.110 
charts as well so this is definitely
what<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.769> track<00:04:09.250> should<00:04:09.519> be<00:04:09.639> looking<00:04:09.880> at<00:04:10.000> and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
what the track should be looking at and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.610 
what the track should be looking at and
actually<00:04:10.359> we<00:04:10.419> can<00:04:10.510> look<00:04:10.569> at<00:04:10.660> JTWC<00:04:11.380> right<00:04:11.530> now

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
actually we can look at JTWC right now

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.650 
actually we can look at JTWC right now

still<00:04:35.690> extends<00:04:36.229> all<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.440> way<00:04:36.620> from<00:04:36.800> a

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
still extends all the way from a

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.370 
still extends all the way from a
southern<00:04:37.610> Taiwan<00:04:38.150> all<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.840> way<00:04:38.930> down<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.139> a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
southern Taiwan all the way down to a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.320 
southern Taiwan all the way down to a
letting<00:04:39.919> golf<00:04:40.160> down<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.610> here<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.120> just

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
letting golf down in here so just

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.780 
letting golf down in here so just
something<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.110> note<00:04:42.710> everybody<00:04:43.370> all

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
something to note everybody all

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.400 
something to note everybody all
throughout<00:04:44.120> this<00:04:44.300> entire<00:04:44.479> region<00:04:44.810> definitely

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
throughout this entire region definitely

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.990 
throughout this entire region definitely
not<00:04:45.560> out<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.949> clear<00:04:46.100> just<00:04:46.190> yet<00:04:46.550> even

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
not out of the clear just yet even

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.330 
not out of the clear just yet even
especially<00:04:47.300> Manila<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.380> largest<00:04:48.800> city<00:04:49.130> down

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
especially Manila the largest city down

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.969 
especially Manila the largest city down
here<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:49.850> this<00:04:50.419> system<00:04:50.840> still<00:04:51.139> could<00:04:51.350> slightly

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
here so this system still could slightly

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.920 
here so this system still could slightly
turn<00:04:52.370> towards<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.970> south<00:04:53.389> couple<00:04:53.720> hundred

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
turn towards the south couple hundred

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.409 
turn towards the south couple hundred
miles<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.440> Manila<00:04:54.710> puts<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.430> trade<00:04:55.669> on<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
miles and Manila puts a trade on the the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.540 
miles and Manila puts a trade on the the
brink<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.050> outer<00:04:57.410> eye<00:04:57.530> wall<00:04:57.889> here<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.340> just

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
brink of the outer eye wall here so just

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.879 
brink of the outer eye wall here so just
something<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.300> know<00:04:59.600> and<00:04:59.990> also<00:05:00.289> showing<00:05:00.650> a

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
something to know and also showing a

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.279 
something to know and also showing a
gma's<00:05:01.400> forecast<00:05:02.000> here<00:05:02.240> as<00:05:02.419> well<00:05:02.600> current<00:05:03.110> knob

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
gma's forecast here as well current knob

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.719 
gma's forecast here as well current knob
pressure<00:05:03.770> rate<00:05:04.130> around<00:05:04.340> nine<00:05:04.490> hundred

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729

seventy five minutes no RHP a right in

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.100 
seventy five minutes no RHP a right in
here<00:05:07.310> uh<00:05:07.340> definitely<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.570> think<00:05:08.630> it's<00:05:08.870> probably

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
here uh definitely I think it's probably

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.080 
here uh definitely I think it's probably
lower<00:05:09.530> by<00:05:09.830> now<00:05:10.100> but<00:05:10.430> we're<00:05:10.639> gonna<00:05:10.729> see<00:05:10.970> this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
lower by now but we're gonna see this

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.640 
lower by now but we're gonna see this
gradually<00:05:11.630> work<00:05:11.810> its<00:05:11.990> way<00:05:12.139> down<00:05:12.169> as<00:05:12.530> this

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
gradually work its way down as this

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.980 
gradually work its way down as this
overall<00:05:13.220> system<00:05:13.550> starts<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> deep<00:05:14.600> in<00:05:14.780> but

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
overall system starts to a deep in but

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.680 
overall system starts to a deep in but
forecast<00:05:15.770> track<00:05:16.010> actually<00:05:16.850> uh<00:05:16.880> ran<00:05:17.389> off<00:05:17.539> to

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
forecast track actually uh ran off to

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.570 
forecast track actually uh ran off to
the<00:05:17.780> west<00:05:17.930> northwest<00:05:18.229> just<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.830> GT<00:05:19.190> WC

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
the west northwest just like GT WC

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.250 
the west northwest just like GT WC
they're<00:05:19.729> taking<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.120> little<00:05:20.300> slightly<00:05:20.780> farther

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
they're taking a little slightly farther

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.840 
they're taking a little slightly farther
north<00:05:21.650> actually<00:05:22.130> right<00:05:22.310> around<00:05:22.460> these<00:05:22.820> uh

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
north actually right around these uh

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.090 
north actually right around these uh
Bobby<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.840> Islands<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.590> believe<00:05:24.800> that's<00:05:24.949> how

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
Bobby on Islands I believe that's how

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.800 
Bobby on Islands I believe that's how
it's<00:05:25.250> pronounced<00:05:25.520> if<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:26.030> please<00:05:26.360> let<00:05:26.630> me

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
know and actually move on to what I'm

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.089 
know and actually move on to what I'm
actually<00:05:29.660> thinking<00:05:29.930> here<00:05:30.260> right<00:05:30.710> now<00:05:30.830> we<00:05:30.889> do

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
actually thinking here right now we do

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.270 
actually thinking here right now we do
have<00:05:31.130> 15<00:05:32.030> whiskey<00:05:32.419> on<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.750> fifteenth<00:05:33.470> skin

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
have 15 whiskey on the fifteenth skin

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.740 
have 15 whiskey on the fifteenth skin
moving<00:05:34.550> up<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.820> west-northwest<00:05:35.210> ain't

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
moving up to the west-northwest ain't

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.200 
moving up to the west-northwest ain't
not<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.229> by<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.470> 17th<00:05:37.340> expecting<00:05:37.789> to<00:05:37.880> be<00:05:37.910> raid

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
not so by the 17th expecting to be raid

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.089 
not so by the 17th expecting to be raid
in<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:38.539> region<00:05:38.810> right<00:05:39.080> here<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.560> making

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
in this region right here in a making

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.370 
in this region right here in a making
landfall<00:05:40.460> just<00:05:40.789> north<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> sierra<00:05:42.139> madre

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
landfall just north of the sierra madre

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.040 
landfall just north of the sierra madre
sear<00:05:43.039> area<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.849> a<00:05:44.120> south<00:05:44.419> of<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.630> Bobby<00:05:44.810> Long

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
sear area in a south of the Bobby Long

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.290 
sear area in a south of the Bobby Long
Island<00:05:45.470> so<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.710> basically<00:05:45.830> puts<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.700> right

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
Island so that basically puts it right

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.360 
Island so that basically puts it right
on<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.720> end<00:05:47.870> very<00:05:48.260> very<00:05:48.650> northern<00:05:48.950> periphery

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
on the end very very northern periphery

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.000 
on the end very very northern periphery
of<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:50.120> Philippines<00:05:50.630> are<00:05:50.840> in<00:05:50.930> Luzon<00:05:51.470> rate<00:05:51.830> in

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
of the Philippines are in Luzon rate in

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.550 
of the Philippines are in Luzon rate in
here<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:52.610> definitely<00:05:53.479> something<00:05:54.320> to

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
here so definitely something to

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.560 
here so definitely something to
everybody<00:05:54.950> up<00:05:55.280> in<00:05:55.430> this<00:05:55.610> region<00:05:55.849> really

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
everybody up in this region really

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.600 
everybody up in this region really
really<00:05:56.930> needs<00:05:57.139> to<00:05:57.260> closely<00:05:57.500> monitor<00:05:57.800> this<00:05:58.340> and

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
really needs to closely monitor this and

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.339 
really needs to closely monitor this and
I<00:05:58.669> prepare<00:05:59.030> for<00:05:59.210> evacuations<00:05:59.840> especially

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
I prepare for evacuations especially

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.290 
I prepare for evacuations especially
near<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.620> other<00:06:01.010> coast<00:06:01.220> but<00:06:01.460> as<00:06:01.699> already

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
near the other coast but as already

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.420 
near the other coast but as already
stated<00:06:02.449> though<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.990> area<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.740> air<00:06:04.010> is<00:06:04.220> still

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
stated though the area of air is still

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.010 
stated though the area of air is still
extending<00:06:04.910> from<00:06:05.000> here<00:06:05.330> all<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.599> way<00:06:05.720> down<00:06:05.990> to

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
extending from here all the way down to

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.110 
extending from here all the way down to
here<00:06:06.590> and<00:06:06.770> definitely<00:06:07.340> Manila<00:06:07.729> needs<00:06:08.000> to

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
here and definitely Manila needs to

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.700 
here and definitely Manila needs to
closely<00:06:08.360> watch<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:08.900> because<00:06:09.080> of<00:06:09.320> this<00:06:09.410> Ridge

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
closely watch this because of this Ridge

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.710 
closely watch this because of this Ridge
as<00:06:09.949> I<00:06:10.490> noted<00:06:10.699> right<00:06:11.030> up<00:06:11.180> in<00:06:11.300> here<00:06:11.449> is<00:06:11.570> really

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
as I noted right up in here is really

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.750 
as I noted right up in here is really
weak<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.229> hard<00:06:12.380> to<00:06:12.500> see<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:12.919> this<00:06:13.370> rich<00:06:13.580> even

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
weak and hard to see but this rich even

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.070 
weak and hard to see but this rich even
builds<00:06:14.120> in<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:14.240> little<00:06:14.539> bit<00:06:14.630> more<00:06:14.840> that's

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
builds in a little bit more that's

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.180 
builds in a little bit more that's
actually<00:06:15.199> going<00:06:15.470> to<00:06:15.560> move<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.800> system

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
actually going to move the system

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.189 
actually going to move the system
farther<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.699> the<00:06:16.729> south<00:06:17.090> so<00:06:17.419> that's<00:06:17.900> only<00:06:18.110> a

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
farther to the south so that's only a

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.570 
farther to the south so that's only a
couple<00:06:18.349> hundred<00:06:18.500> miles<00:06:18.889> difference<00:06:19.400> and

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
couple hundred miles difference and

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.400 
couple hundred miles difference and
something<00:06:19.910> we<00:06:20.030> need<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.300> clearly<00:06:20.780> note<00:06:21.139> on

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
something we need to clearly note on

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.409 
something we need to clearly note on
this<00:06:21.650> so<00:06:21.860> but<00:06:22.310> basically<00:06:22.729> everybody

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
this so but basically everybody

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.659 
this so but basically everybody
especially<00:06:23.840> even<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.349> northwest<00:06:25.160> coast<00:06:25.460> of

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
especially even the northwest coast of

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.159 
especially even the northwest coast of
the<00:06:25.789> Philippines<00:06:26.270> our<00:06:26.539> rate<00:06:26.780> up<00:06:26.900> in<00:06:27.020> this

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
the Philippines our rate up in this

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.020 
the Philippines our rate up in this
region<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.800> need<00:06:27.979> to<00:06:28.130> closely<00:06:28.400> monitor<00:06:28.699> is

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
region you need to closely monitor is

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.180 
region you need to closely monitor is
because<00:06:29.479> as<00:06:29.630> this<00:06:30.020> system<00:06:30.440> moves<00:06:30.650> past<00:06:30.889> we<00:06:31.160> can

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
because as this system moves past we can

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.670 
because as this system moves past we can
still<00:06:31.550> see<00:06:31.760> another<00:06:32.630> storm<00:06:33.050> surge<00:06:33.289> come<00:06:33.560> out

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
still see another storm surge come out

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.350 
still see another storm surge come out
of<00:06:33.830> this<00:06:33.919> at<00:06:34.190> from<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.610> southern<00:06:35.090> periphery

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
of this at from the southern periphery

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.790 
of this at from the southern periphery
the<00:06:35.719> winds<00:06:35.870> are<00:06:35.930> going<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.110> be<00:06:36.169> coming<00:06:36.320> back<00:06:36.560> on

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
the winds are going to be coming back on

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.640 
the winds are going to be coming back on
towards<00:06:37.370> a<00:06:37.490> land<00:06:37.849> so<00:06:38.240> even<00:06:38.960> this<00:06:39.050> coast<00:06:39.349> read

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
towards a land so even this coast read

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.540 
towards a land so even this coast read
in<00:06:39.800> here<00:06:40.070> not

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
in here not

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.580 
in here not
us<00:06:40.640> the<00:06:40.820> East<00:06:41.300> Coast<00:06:41.600> needs<00:06:41.930> to<00:06:42.080> really<00:06:42.320> watch

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
us the East Coast needs to really watch

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.850 
us the East Coast needs to really watch
this<00:06:42.860> closely<00:06:43.390> but<00:06:44.390> then<00:06:44.510> after<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:45.560> system

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
this closely but then after the system

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.530 
this closely but then after the system
was<00:06:46.040> over<00:06:46.250> Luzon<00:06:46.550> expecting<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.060> move<00:06:47.180> off<00:06:47.330> to

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
was over Luzon expecting to move off to

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.840 
was over Luzon expecting to move off to
the<00:06:47.660> north<00:06:48.080> west<00:06:48.920> again<00:06:49.280> the<00:06:49.460> west-northwest

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
the north west again the west-northwest

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.030 
the north west again the west-northwest
and<00:06:50.510> possibly<00:06:51.140> making<00:06:51.440> landfall<00:06:51.710> are

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
and possibly making landfall are

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.500 
and possibly making landfall are
definitely<00:06:52.400> making<00:06:52.520> landfall<00:06:52.790> along<00:06:53.060> the

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
definitely making landfall along the

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.930 
definitely making landfall along the
southeastern<00:06:54.380> China<00:06:54.650> possibly<00:06:55.460> ray<00:06:55.610> around

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
southeastern China possibly ray around

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.480 
southeastern China possibly ray around
Hong<00:06:56.180> Kong<00:06:56.480> so<00:06:56.840> just<00:06:57.350> something<00:06:57.530> to<00:06:57.680> note<00:06:58.100> here

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
Hong Kong so just something to note here

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.370 
Hong Kong so just something to note here
right<00:06:58.970> now<00:06:59.120> I<00:06:59.150> don't<00:06:59.270> want<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.510> gun<00:06:59.690> jump<00:07:00.320> the

right now I don't want a gun jump the
gun<00:07:00.920> too<00:07:01.220> quickly<00:07:01.520> on<00:07:01.850> this<00:07:02.060> is<00:07:02.270> this<00:07:02.420> is<00:07:02.570> a

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
gun too quickly on this is this is a

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.230 
gun too quickly on this is this is a
very<00:07:02.810> vast<00:07:03.290> area<00:07:03.770> up<00:07:03.890> in<00:07:04.040> here<00:07:04.340> but<00:07:04.580> everybody

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
very vast area up in here but everybody

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.450 
very vast area up in here but everybody
along<00:07:05.540> this<00:07:05.780> entire<00:07:06.290> coast<00:07:06.740> definitely<00:07:07.250> needs

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
along this entire coast definitely needs

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.580 
along this entire coast definitely needs
to<00:07:07.610> a<00:07:07.760> watch<00:07:08.120> the<00:07:08.300> system<00:07:08.690> as<00:07:08.840> well<00:07:09.020> and<00:07:09.320> i<00:07:09.410> was

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
to a watch the system as well and i was

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.860 
to a watch the system as well and i was
already<00:07:09.860> clean<00:07:10.670> clearly<00:07:11.180> see<00:07:11.390> on<00:07:11.570> how<00:07:11.690> many

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
already clean clearly see on how many

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.900 
already clean clearly see on how many
news<00:07:12.170> reports<00:07:12.680> already<00:07:12.860> being<00:07:13.250> watched<00:07:13.670> so

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
news reports already being watched so

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.640 
news reports already being watched so
just<00:07:14.480> something<00:07:14.630> good<00:07:14.930> to<00:07:15.020> note<00:07:15.200> here<00:07:15.440> but

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
just something good to note here but

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.800 
just something good to note here but
basically<00:07:16.130> after<00:07:16.790> the<00:07:17.060> system<00:07:17.420> was<00:07:17.570> over

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
basically after the system was over

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.180 
basically after the system was over
those<00:07:17.990> on<00:07:18.140> looks<00:07:18.440> like<00:07:18.620> the<00:07:18.770> subtropical

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
those on looks like the subtropical

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.890 
those on looks like the subtropical
Ridge<00:07:19.580> should<00:07:19.820> weaken<00:07:20.180> enough<00:07:20.420> for<00:07:20.630> this<00:07:20.750> to

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
Ridge should weaken enough for this to

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.570 
Ridge should weaken enough for this to
begin<00:07:21.200> a<00:07:21.230> recurve<00:07:21.740> ature<00:07:22.010> up<00:07:22.160> towards<00:07:22.460> this

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
begin a recurve ature up towards this

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.940 
begin a recurve ature up towards this
region<00:07:23.080> that<00:07:24.080> is<00:07:24.230> all<00:07:24.350> for<00:07:24.560> now<00:07:24.620> everybody

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950 
region that is all for now everybody

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.580 
region that is all for now everybody
