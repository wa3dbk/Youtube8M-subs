00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.690
 you 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.690
 Yes 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.890
 little video to show how 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:25.240
 restore luster to his lighthouse then he 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:28.430
 we just need a little rag and 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.480
 toothpaste is polishing point 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.160
 that exist for that but hey 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.920
 toothpaste that works well and so 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.280
 it's very simple just enough to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.460
 put a little with a towel rub 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.460
 vigorously 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.489
 and now with the garden hose 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.860
 to wet the surface to pull the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.000
 little two-year film he would do if he 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.180
 was actually in the toothpaste 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.210
 there are little balls like that they 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.290
 will be used to polish the lighthouse now 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.470
 we're going to reims and we'll see what 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.470
 given 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:44.799
 I'm wiped away we're left more than 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 July and then we really see that the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.270
 lighthouse is more brighter than before 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.780
 here with traces before and here we do not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.240
 really sees more and that's really 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.000
 much brighter here if you 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.179
 did you like green thumbs and see you next 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.179
 video
