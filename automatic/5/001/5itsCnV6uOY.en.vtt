anyway<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.520> think<00:05:00.000> tomorrow<00:05:00.360> I'm<00:05:00.539> gonna

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
anyway so I think tomorrow I'm gonna

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.390 
anyway so I think tomorrow I'm gonna
have<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.020> break<00:05:01.289> my<00:05:01.320> banana<00:05:01.830> island

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
have to break my banana island

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.680 
have to break my banana island
because<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:02.760> don't<00:05:02.820> really<00:05:03.150> think<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.510> I've

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
because I don't really think that I've

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.420 
because I don't really think that I've
got<00:05:03.720> enough<00:05:03.960> bananas<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.949> don't<00:05:05.010> want<00:05:05.370> to

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
got enough bananas and I don't want to

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.080 
got enough bananas and I don't want to
use<00:05:05.550> up<00:05:05.699> all<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:05.970> my<00:05:06.449> bananas<00:05:06.870> because<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:08.090> don't

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
use up all of my bananas because I don't

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.490 
use up all of my bananas because I don't
know<00:05:09.150> how<00:05:09.270> many<00:05:09.330> I'm<00:05:09.510> gonna<00:05:09.660> get<00:05:09.810> next<00:05:10.050> week<00:05:10.110> so

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
know how many I'm gonna get next week so

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.730 
know how many I'm gonna get next week so
I<00:05:10.530> think<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:11.130> should<00:05:11.160> probably<00:05:11.400> keep<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.729> few<00:05:12.000> um

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
I think I should probably keep a few um

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.379 
I think I should probably keep a few um
but<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.949> will<00:05:14.190> have<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> fully<00:05:14.669> raw<00:05:14.880> day<00:05:15.060> tomorrow

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
but I will have a fully raw day tomorrow

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.659 
but I will have a fully raw day tomorrow
I<00:05:15.449> think<00:05:15.600> because<00:05:16.470> I've<00:05:16.949> got<00:05:17.130> dance<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
I think because I've got dance and I

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.700 
I think because I've got dance and I
drink<00:05:17.790> at<00:05:17.940> home<00:05:18.060> too<00:05:18.270> late<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:18.810> you're<00:05:18.960> eating

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
drink at home too late so you're eating

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.100 
drink at home too late so you're eating
fruit<00:05:20.340> before<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.330> go<00:05:21.449> to<00:05:21.510> bed<00:05:21.570> it's<00:05:21.870> just

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
fruit before I go to bed it's just

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.710 
fruit before I go to bed it's just
better<00:05:22.440> than<00:05:22.770> eating<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.060> huge<00:05:24.449> cooked

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
better than eating like a huge cooked

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.200 
better than eating like a huge cooked
meal<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.380> I<00:05:25.620> will<00:05:26.250> break<00:05:26.430> my<00:05:26.639> banana<00:05:26.910> island

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
meal so I will break my banana island

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.629 
meal so I will break my banana island
tomorrow<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.680> will<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:29.160> a<00:05:29.190> fully<00:05:29.460> raw<00:05:29.580> day

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
tomorrow but I will have a fully raw day

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.580 
tomorrow but I will have a fully raw day
so<00:05:30.419> it's<00:05:30.780> not<00:05:30.960> because<00:05:31.169> they<00:05:31.260> don't<00:05:31.290> want<00:05:31.470> to

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
so it's not because they don't want to

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.960 
so it's not because they don't want to
even<00:05:31.740> on<00:05:31.919> ion<00:05:32.190> because<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.550> really<00:05:32.760> would<00:05:32.850> love
