or<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.100> big<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.420> trying<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> twist<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
or not it's big I was trying to twist in

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.910 
or not it's big I was trying to twist in
for<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.559> level<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.930> I<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
for the first level and I got about I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
for the first level and I got about I
think<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> level<00:00:51.149> an<00:00:51.360> hour<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.140> then

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
think it was a level an hour but then

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
think it was a level an hour but then
after<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.309> hour<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:53.879> he<00:00:54.210> went

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
after the first hour and a bit he went

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.779 
after the first hour and a bit he went
off<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> sleep<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.219> solo<00:00:56.430> trained

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
off to sleep so that I just solo trained

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.950 
off to sleep so that I just solo trained
then<00:00:57.120> yeah<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> managed<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.050> another<00:00:59.960> two

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

then yeah I managed to get another two
hundred<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.469> twenty-five<00:01:01.829> percent<00:01:02.070> or

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
hundred and twenty-five percent or

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.680

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and I don't know that's I thought about

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.620 
and I don't know that's I thought about
that<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.070> wondered<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.880> wanted<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.270> do<00:03:04.450> it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that and wondered if I wanted to do it

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.110 
that and wondered if I wanted to do it
but<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.960> know<00:03:07.990> I<00:03:08.260> tend<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.220> want<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.820> have<00:03:09.910> my

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
but you know I tend to want to have my

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.110 
but you know I tend to want to have my
own<00:03:10.150> sort<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.720> brand<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.520> incent<00:03:12.520> abs<00:03:12.970> are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
own sort of brand and incent abs are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.530 
own sort of brand and incent abs are
like<00:03:13.270> business<00:03:14.110> knowledge<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.480> all

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
like business knowledge there are all

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.260 
like business knowledge there are all
different<00:03:17.280> variations<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.610> same<00:03:18.670> product

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
different variations of the same product

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.390 
different variations of the same product
and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.989> believe<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.680> each<00:03:20.830> thing<00:03:21.130> he<00:03:21.250> has<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
and I believe that each thing he has to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.479 
and I believe that each thing he has to
be<00:03:21.580> about<00:03:21.760> ten<00:03:22.300> percent<00:03:22.890> different<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.160> order

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
be about ten percent different in order

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.100 
be about ten percent different in order
to<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:25.230> successful<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.900> I've

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
to be successful so like you know I've

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.900 
to be successful so like you know I've
wondered<00:03:29.440> back<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.800> thinking<00:03:30.220> whether<00:03:30.550> all

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
wondered back to thinking whether all

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.270 
wondered back to thinking whether all
did<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.300> really<00:03:31.630> copy<00:03:31.840> copy<00:03:32.260> tony<00:03:32.590> was<00:03:32.830> doing<00:03:33.070> in

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
differently than why he did it and he

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.449 
differently than why he did it and he
does<00:03:40.930> his<00:03:41.050> videos<00:03:41.470> difference<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> way<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:42.370> do
