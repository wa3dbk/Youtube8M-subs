farming looking for year and every once

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.090 
farming looking for year and every once
in<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> while<00:01:44.929> something<00:01:45.929> cool<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.649> something

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in a while something cool or something

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.399 
in a while something cool or something
phase<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.580> will<00:01:47.610> happen<00:01:47.929> not<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> don't

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
phase it will happen not and I don't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
phase it will happen not and I don't
always<00:01:49.590> record<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> either<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.820> there's<00:01:51.390> kind

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
always record it either so there's kind

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
always record it either so there's kind
of<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> lack<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.080> content<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:52.860> channel<00:01:52.890> right

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of a lack of content on my channel right

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.860 
of a lack of content on my channel right
now

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
now

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.390 
now
and<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.380> think<00:01:54.440> things<00:01:54.890> would<00:01:55.130> change

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
and I think things would change

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.780 
and I think things would change
