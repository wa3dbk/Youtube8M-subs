00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.849
 is played here in this final on 13 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.570
 won games 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.699
 However, it should be noted that 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.149
 Poss admonished that comes from the loser's round and therefore already lost once 

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.179
 has event lie 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.400
 Waldemar Maier Kurt as before 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.489
 mentioned 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.279
 that this buffer warned 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.340
 Win once on December, whereas Martinez 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.340
 ready a winner 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.690
 the need for that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.360
 I'm winning for the winner check 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.430
 and tens of thousands means 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 to bag 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 both players come across 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 from the left side of the table 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 Seen from our side, the white ball is very close to the top 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 Goof on 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 and it turned out that this point 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.750
 optimal 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 for a break at this table 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 from 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 an incredibly cute midfielder of this mix of renewable 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.540
 he has to play around here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 to push the white over 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.210
 next ball of the 6th 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.220
 the FAS was just standing 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.440
 that too 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.610
 of course now 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 easy game for Bustamante 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.039
 the audience 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.129
 very interested in the three k et 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.569
 the residential area matches 3 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.809
 it was probably about 2 300 people 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.439
 every day 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.909
 one to zero 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 for Bustamante 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 no emotion in the face of the Mexican 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.310
 why do you ask yourself to make the score of 1, however 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.329
 these players 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.729
 quite often times 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.669
 5 6 make seven games on the line without the opponent even one 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.329
 Puff of a chance receives 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.479
 therefore 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.059
 that is for sure 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.449
 not pleasant 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.269
 when you sit outside yourself and Bustamante is at the table 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.269
 and downplay the games 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.759
 especially if 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.309
 yes, his break point has always been found 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.489
 Cameron sees 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.219
 So this is poster coat 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 then he can hardly be stopped anymore 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.959
 and what is for the audience a feast for the eyes 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.269
 namely that Bustamante flawless 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.239
 these simple games shoot out 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.519
 This is a pain for the opponent who sits outside and waits 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.829
 Of course, after the break, he already knows that 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:23.680
 do not apply anymore 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 will come to the board 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.479
 and it is very difficult to keep Walter Martinez in his concentration 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.749
 to wait patiently for his chance 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.479
 then 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.489
 can follow 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:52.930
 been 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.009
 because you are more direct 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.430
 right in the front row to see Kylie Poland 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.749
 here 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.749
 Everything has been wonderfully organized 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.089
 Of course, Bustamante is now at the table 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.850
 always the player is allowed to perform the next break, including the previous one 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.849
 Game has won 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.069
 that was already on a trial basis 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.090
 but do not give 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.930
 the player liked 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.930
 and also most of the premieres 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.050
 makes one is still like that 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.949
 as usual 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.949
 regularly in the 9-ball Texters Express 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.849
 and it is allowed to toast next to the player as well 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:58.660
 because straight 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.860
 the 9th 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.409
 what has thought 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.409
 heavy ball for Bustamante 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.259
 Dieter like once in the corner Bloch 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.919
 very close to this 8 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.809
 can not judge from this perspective 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.569
 Voltaire playing the combination 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.569
 that too is difficult to fathom 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.400
 the Martinez had been on the board ever since 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.690
 2 c minor but 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.690
 for Bustamante 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.199
 Imagine you have the Neshat 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.269
 good and happy to wait two and a half hours for this finale 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.139
 say so cold and Fiesta to such entry point as just that 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.139
 once 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.289
 he plays most balls with his heels over tempo 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.849
 sort of faster than necessary 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.849
 Huber as you would expect 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.559
 does not mean that 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:30.559
 Warsaw orders plays 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.860
 to see on this ball the 8 would have to build 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:40.349
 St Abdi can still play their target cotton candy past the Aach 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:41.809
 white ball 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.809
 then send the black to the middle ear 

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:52.899
 the courses Dagmar Ploetz 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.499
 I was not invented 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:07:59.309
 it is more to him 

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:02.139
 right to shoot 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:04.060
 to thunder the balls into the hole
