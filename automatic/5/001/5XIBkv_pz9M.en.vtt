00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.560 
and the pool that we didn't install
and<00:02:13.400> problem<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> cut<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and problem is you got to cut the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.210 
and problem is you got to cut the
concrete<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.380> run<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> plumbing<00:02:17.070> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
concrete out to run the plumbing to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.330 
concrete out to run the plumbing to
actually<00:02:17.850> do<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:19.320> we<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.770> very

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
actually do it so if we do this very

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
actually do it so if we do this very
inexpensive<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.370> later<00:02:23.610> on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
inexpensive to do that and then later on

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.080 
inexpensive to do that and then later on
you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.450> add<00:02:24.510> your<00:02:24.780> water<00:02:24.900> feature<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.910> take

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
you can add your water feature and take

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.060 
you can add your water feature and take
a<00:02:27.120> walk<00:02:27.390> around<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:28.730> what<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.820> see<00:02:29.880> here<00:02:30.510> is

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
a walk around here what you see here is

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.940 
a walk around here what you see here is
coping<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> pool<00:02:33.170> 18<00:02:34.170> inches<00:02:34.530> it's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
coping on the pool 18 inches it's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.640 
coping on the pool 18 inches it's
actually<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> stamped<00:02:35.820> border<00:02:36.210> called<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> jumbo

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
actually a stamped border called a jumbo

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.780 
actually a stamped border called a jumbo
rock<00:02:38.310> stamp<00:02:38.790> zoom<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:41.900> okay<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.640> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
rock stamp zoom in on that okay and you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.920 
rock stamp zoom in on that okay and you
can<00:02:44.910> see<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.300> that's<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.870> typical<00:02:47.930> it's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
can see that that's just a typical it's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390 
can see that that's just a typical it's
like<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> jumbo<00:02:49.500> rock<00:02:49.710> pattern

like a jumbo rock pattern

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.770 
like a jumbo rock pattern
now<00:02:52.100> we<00:02:53.100> put<00:02:53.400> cuts<00:02:54.260> about<00:02:55.260> five<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.370> six<00:02:56.640> feet

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
now we put cuts about five to six feet

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.520 
now we put cuts about five to six feet
it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:58.170> give<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> coping<00:02:59.130> look<00:03:00.530> another

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
it does give it that coping look another

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.670 
it does give it that coping look another
