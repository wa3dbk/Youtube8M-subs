cockpit<00:00:19.830> adjustable<00:00:20.340> items<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
cockpit adjustable items we have in the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.160 
cockpit adjustable items we have in the
race<00:00:21.330> car<00:00:28.820> probably<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> biggest<00:00:30.170> cockpit

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
race car probably the biggest cockpit

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
race car probably the biggest cockpit
adjustable<00:00:31.740> item<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
adjustable item that we have is that the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.729 
adjustable item that we have is that the
anti-roll<00:00:33.570> bars<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> front<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.680> the

rear of the car and in a race situation

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.970 
rear of the car and in a race situation
this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.550> critical<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.149> us<00:00:39.450> because

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
this is very critical for us because

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.319 
this is very critical for us because
depending<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> balance<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> car<00:00:42.059> if

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
depending on the balance of the car if

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
depending on the balance of the car if
we've<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.629> too<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:42.960> oversteer<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.160> can

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
we've got too much oversteer we can

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
we've got too much oversteer we can
either<00:00:44.430> soften<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> rear<00:00:45.210> bar<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.719> stiffen

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
either soften the rear bar or stiffen

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
either soften the rear bar or stiffen
the<00:00:46.170> front<00:00:46.410> bar<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.760> vice<00:00:47.969> versa<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.480> if

the front bar and and vice versa or if
we<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.500> much<00:00:49.649> understeer<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> car

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we have too much understeer in the car

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060 
we have too much understeer in the car
we<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.149> try<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.930> stiffen<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> rear<00:00:52.559> bar<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
we can try and stiffen the rear bar or

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.340 
we can try and stiffen the rear bar or
soften<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> front<00:00:53.879> bar<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.480> generally<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
soften the front bar so generally at the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
soften the front bar so generally at the
start<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> stint<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> tires<00:00:56.789> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
start of the stint when the tires are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.279 
start of the stint when the tires are
good<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.329> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> try<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> run<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> sway

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
good we want to try and run the sway

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.209 
good we want to try and run the sway
bars<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.859> stiff<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.000> possible<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.219> generally

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
bars as stiff as possible but generally

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
bars as stiff as possible but generally
as<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> tires<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> they

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
as the tires go off and that and they

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.890 
as the tires go off and that and they
degrade<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:05.580> start<00:01:05.820> sliding<00:01:06.060> around<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
degrade we start sliding around more so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
degrade we start sliding around more so
we<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.320> soften<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.860> roll<00:01:08.010> bars<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
we have to soften the roll bars off so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.170 
we have to soften the roll bars off so
it's<00:01:09.299> quite<00:01:10.020> common<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.979> guys<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:12.030> be

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's quite common for the guys to be

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.690 
it's quite common for the guys to be
changing<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> roll<00:01:13.020> bar<00:01:13.229> settings

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
changing the roll bar settings

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
changing the roll bar settings
throughout<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> race<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.450> probably<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
throughout the race and probably the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
throughout the race and probably the
other<00:01:16.530> biggest<00:01:17.220> adjustment<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
other biggest adjustment that we have in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.740 
other biggest adjustment that we have in
the<00:01:18.689> cockpit<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.770> our<00:01:20.100> brake<00:01:20.729> boss<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the cockpit is is our brake boss so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109 
the cockpit is is our brake boss so
that's<00:01:22.409> adjusted<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.670> knob<00:01:23.880> down

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that's adjusted with a little knob down

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's adjusted with a little knob down
the<00:01:24.299> side<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:25.380> seat<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.310> pretty

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the side of my seat here and it's pretty

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
the side of my seat here and it's pretty
simple<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.140> more<00:01:28.320> brake

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
simple all if I want more brake

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.380 
simple all if I want more brake
percentage<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> front<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> car<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
percentage to the front of the car I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
percentage to the front of the car I
just<00:01:30.780> won<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> knob<00:01:31.380> forward<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.240> want

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
just won the knob forward and if I want

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.440 
just won the knob forward and if I want
more<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> rear<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
more to the rear I want it to the to the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.280 
more to the rear I want it to the to the
rear<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> car<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.470> pretty<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.460> simple

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
rear of the car so pretty pretty simple

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.710 
rear of the car so pretty pretty simple
and<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.430> every<00:01:41.880> team<00:01:42.119> does<00:01:42.420> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and you know every team does it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
and you know every team does it
differently<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:44.189> our<00:01:44.399> cars<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:45.149> how

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
differently but on our cars that's how

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
differently but on our cars that's how
it's<00:01:45.450> set<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.829> typically<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> start<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's set up typically at the start of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's set up typically at the start of
the<00:01:48.060> race<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.540> full<00:01:49.079> fuel<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:50.100> run<00:01:50.369> more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the race with full fuel will run more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.940 
the race with full fuel will run more
percentage<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> brake<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> rear<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> then

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
percentage of brake to the rear and then

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
percentage of brake to the rear and then
as<00:01:53.130> throughout<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> stint<00:01:54.210> has<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.990> fuel

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
as throughout the stint has the fuel

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
as throughout the stint has the fuel
load<00:01:55.409> lightens<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> creep<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> bit

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
load lightens we have to creep on a bit

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.840 
load lightens we have to creep on a bit
more<00:01:57.210> front<00:01:57.479> front<00:01:58.290> brake<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.250> they're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
more front front brake so they're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.340 
more front front brake so they're
probably<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.450> biggest<00:02:00.600> items<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.259> we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
probably the two biggest items that we

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
probably the two biggest items that we
can<00:02:01.530> adjust<00:02:01.619> inside<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> car<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.240> try<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
can adjust inside the car to try and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.359 
can adjust inside the car to try and
maximize<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> speed<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> car<00:02:05.070> throughout

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
maximize the speed of the car throughout

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.020 
maximize the speed of the car throughout
a<00:02:05.520> race

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a race

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
a race
well<00:02:06.509> another<00:02:06.719> feature<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.259> inside<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
well another feature we have inside the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.760 
well another feature we have inside the
car<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.849> line<00:02:09.030> Locker<00:02:09.270> which<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.229> button

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
car is the line Locker which is a button

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.470 
car is the line Locker which is a button
we<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> steering<00:02:11.670> wheel

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
we have on the steering wheel

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.619 
we have on the steering wheel
and<00:02:13.160> basically<00:02:14.160> some<00:02:14.459> guys<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.330> feature

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
and basically some guys use this feature

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.170 
and basically some guys use this feature
to<00:02:16.200> Martha<00:02:16.950> stop<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.280> car<00:02:17.459> from<00:02:17.670> rolling<00:02:17.849> at

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to Martha stop the car from rolling at

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
to Martha stop the car from rolling at
the<00:02:18.209> start<00:02:18.739> or<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:20.310> load<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> clutch<00:02:21.120> up<00:02:21.330> at

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the start or to load the clutch up at

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.020 
the start or to load the clutch up at
the<00:02:21.599> start<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.230> depending<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.069> individual

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the start so depending on individual

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
the start so depending on individual
preference<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.819> about

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
preference really is is how you go about

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.780 
preference really is is how you go about
it<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.510> basically<00:02:28.099> loading<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.340> clutch<00:02:29.550> up

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
it but basically loading the clutch up

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.940 
it but basically loading the clutch up
sort<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.150> involves<00:02:30.660> coming<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> line

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
sort of involves coming up to the line

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.110 
sort of involves coming up to the line
when<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.819> come<00:02:33.239> into<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.540> grid<00:02:33.840> spot<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
when you come into your grid spot and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
when you come into your grid spot and
bringing<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.209> X<00:02:37.200> amount<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.739> brake<00:02:38.430> pressure

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
bringing up X amount of brake pressure

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.120 
bringing up X amount of brake pressure
which<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.750> haven't<00:02:39.959> displayed<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:40.830> dash

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
which you haven't displayed on your dash

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.890 
which you haven't displayed on your dash
and<00:02:41.430> then<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.670> basically<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.599> hold<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and then you basically just hold the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
and then you basically just hold the
line<00:02:42.930> Locker<00:02:43.319> button<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.519> basically

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
line Locker button and that basically

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.530 
line Locker button and that basically
holds<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> front<00:02:46.560> brakes<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.540> whatever

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
holds the front brakes on at whatever

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
holds the front brakes on at whatever
brake<00:02:48.930> put<00:02:49.140> pressure<00:02:49.830> you've<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.400> guess

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
brake put pressure you've I guess

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.780 
brake put pressure you've I guess
selected<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.709> from<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
selected and then from there it's a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.640 
selected and then from there it's a
matter<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.090> selecting<00:02:54.720> first<00:02:54.930> gear<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.290> then

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
matter of selecting first gear and then

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
matter of selecting first gear and then
basically<00:02:56.099> letting<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.610> clutch<00:02:56.819> out<00:02:57.060> til<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
basically letting the clutch out til you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.710 
basically letting the clutch out til you
filled<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> Black<00:02:58.470> Point<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.760> waiting

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
filled the Black Point and then waiting

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.500 
filled the Black Point and then waiting
for<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.989> five<00:03:01.410> second<00:03:01.829> signal<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:03.060> come<00:03:03.239> from

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
for the five second signal to come from

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.930 
for the five second signal to come from
the<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.290> starters<00:03:04.680> box<00:03:04.920> bring<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:05.760> your

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the the starters box bring up your

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.759 
the the starters box bring up your
throttle<00:03:06.269> percentage<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.959> whatever

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
throttle percentage to whatever

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.009 
throttle percentage to whatever
percentage<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.519> want<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.910> then<00:03:09.450> start<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
percentage you want and then start to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.620 
percentage you want and then start to
sort<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.260> let<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.440> clutch<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.510> let<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
sort of let the clutch out and let the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.170 
sort of let the clutch out and let the
clutch<00:03:12.840> load<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.680> basically<00:03:14.400> from<00:03:14.940> there

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
clutch load up and basically from there

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.569 
clutch load up and basically from there
you'll<00:03:15.959> get<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.859> stage<00:03:17.100> where<00:03:17.430> you're

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
you'll get to a stage where you're

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.080 
you'll get to a stage where you're
waiting<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.120> red<00:03:18.299> lights<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:19.109> out<00:03:19.319> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
waiting for the red lights to go out and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.849 
waiting for the red lights to go out and
once<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> lights<00:03:21.389> go<00:03:21.600> out<00:03:21.630> let<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.739> the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
once the lights go out let go of the

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.710 
once the lights go out let go of the
button<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.370> modulate<00:03:24.000> your<00:03:24.030> throttle<00:03:24.569> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
button and modulate your throttle and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
button and modulate your throttle and
clutch<00:03:24.989> from<00:03:25.769> there<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> actually

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
clutch from there so it is actually

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.220 
clutch from there so it is actually
quite<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.130> technical<00:03:29.389> process<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.109> know

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
quite a technical process and you know

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.349 
quite a technical process and you know
it<00:03:31.470> sounds<00:03:32.069> sort<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> pretty<00:03:32.489> simple<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
it sounds sort of pretty simple but it

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.970 
it sounds sort of pretty simple but it
does<00:03:33.389> take<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> bit<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.019> adjusting<00:03:34.560> too<00:03:34.739> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
does take a bit of adjusting too and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.250 
does take a bit of adjusting too and
like<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.910> said<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.269> know<00:03:36.359> each<00:03:36.540> driver<00:03:36.870> does<00:03:37.139> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
like I said you know each driver does it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.309 
like I said you know each driver does it
differently<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.299> some<00:03:39.299> guys<00:03:39.510> choose<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.139> to

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
differently and some guys choose not to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.349 
differently and some guys choose not to
load<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> clutch<00:03:40.859> up<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.880> use<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> line

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
load the clutch up and just use a line

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.199 
load the clutch up and just use a line
Locker<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.900> as<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.290> guess<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.060> system<00:03:45.060> that

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
Locker just as I guess a system that

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.699 
Locker just as I guess a system that
prevents<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.690> car<00:03:45.870> from<00:03:46.109> rolling<00:03:46.260> at<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
prevents the car from rolling at the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.150 
prevents the car from rolling at the
start<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.730> were<00:03:47.880> rolling<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.920> yeah<00:03:49.920> that's

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
start if you were rolling so yeah that's

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.680
