the Italian sausage and it is pretty

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.190 
the Italian sausage and it is pretty
much<00:04:26.889> dying<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:28.240> reason<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.600> do<00:04:28.750> another<00:04:28.960> 30

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
much dying the reason you do another 30

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.980 
much dying the reason you do another 30
minutes<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.710> Italian<00:04:30.010> sausage<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.990> just
