00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.330
 just that ticket 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.600
 almost five years have passed 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.489
 from the release of the first bioshock a title 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.470
 which he brought back strongly in the foreground 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.310
 the importance of history within 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.310
 a first person shooter 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.470
 But today we are here to talk about 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 bioshock infinite the ideal century 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.650
 developed again by ken 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:03.200
 levine is ready to enter the market 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:01:04.880
 on pc playstation 3 and xbox 360 will be 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 once again the genius succeeded 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.980
 game designers to amaze us with the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.020
 original and unpublished original universe 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:22.220
 convincingly we find that in this 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:24.170
 video review no no no no 2 the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.030
 bioshock infinite the player dresses i 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.979
 clothes of the private investigator booker 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.950
 dewitt we are in an alternative version 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.900
 of 1912 and hired by two mysterious 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.240
 figures the protagonist must go up 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.190
 columbia a flying city built 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.590
 from the united states but escaped his 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.150
 control has become independent 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.400
 the goal is to recover one 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.380
 girl elizabeth who unfortunately is 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.960
 guarded by a visionary dictator 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.020
 zaccaria the com stop considered one 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 kind of deity from the population 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.990
 columbia has only one facade of 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.850
 benevolence and do-goodment since later 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.130
 a few hours of play you find yourself in the middle 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.020
 of serious infighting comes to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.490
 knowledge of vox peoples a faction 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.890
 outlaw who tries to return 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.920
 dignity and freedom to the poorest classes 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 ghetted history is engaging well 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.459
 narrated is populated by characters 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.140
 secondary of great charm though 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.150
 part of the narration takes place 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.049
 through the obsolete use of diaries from 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.549
 to collect 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.920
 everything ends with a final 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.600
 fascinating that perhaps sins of coherence 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.900
 and does not reach the peaks of the first 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.900
 bioshock 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.300
 as for the gameplay of 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 infinite it is difficult to notice large ones 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.470
 steps forward compared to what we have seen 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.240
 in the first bioshock bucher can bring in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.490
 one hand two weapons at a time exploiting 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.050
 an arsenal that ranges from the gun to the 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.420
 submachine gun 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.370
 automatic or a rocket launcher the other hand 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.410
 instead it is dedicated to the vigors that like i 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.180
 plasmids of the old bioshock allow 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.400
 to use magical powers and abilities 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.170
 special the variety is great but who has 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
 already played the first chapters will hear 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.010
 strong feeling of already seen 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.930
 you can have a temporary ally 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.030
 launch electric shocks or attacks 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.670
 of fire or create a magnetic shield 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.080
 to send the shots back to the sender 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.450
 the fights are therefore enough 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 classics the only real innovation is 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.450
 represented by the tracks that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.820
 they embellish some of the settings 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 of columbia the player can indeed 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 go up there and start fights 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.730
 extremely frantic and fast 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 these particular sections are to say the least 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630
 little excellent but unfortunately I am also 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.670
 quite rare given that much of it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.470
 of the game is set on stage 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.060
 restricted or indoors 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.310
 another peculiarity of bioshock 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.560
 infinite is represented by the character 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.000
 of Elizabeth in the initial plans the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.130
 girl should have played a role 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.990
 fundamental in the game but in reality yes 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.000
 limits you to be a simple helper in the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.950
 course of adventure his power of 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.840
 open dimensional gaps over time e 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.300
 in space it is actually a ploy 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.370
 to fill the scenario with shelters 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.330
 ammunition or defensive towers 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.310
 still remains a character 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.510
 interesting that works a lot 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.070
 realistic 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.320
 thanks also to his stage presence 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.090
 and excellent dialogues speaking 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.770
 of artificial intelligence we note 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.390
 a tendency of the enemies and stay a lot 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.610
 distant from the player during the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.260
 fighting for most of the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.660
 clashes you can safely stay 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.310
 crouched behind a chest or hidden 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.780
 around a corner without the risk 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.640
 let someone come near you 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.799
 the discourse for units is different 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.140
 special like the patriot all and he man 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.060
 in this case the fight becomes 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.400
 much more tactical since one has to that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.010
 dealing with much more resistant opponents 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.450
 and equipped with weapons and skills 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.370
 incredibly powerful is in these 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.280
 moments that infinite bioshock succeeds in 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.750
 propose something really new 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.460
 restoring even stronger sensations 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.350
 of those tried during the first ones 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.729
 meetings with big daddys also for 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.320
 as for the equipment e 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.190
 similarities with the original chapter 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.440
 of the series 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.150
 they are strong during the adventure is 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.250
 it is possible to rummage through waste 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.200
 enemies and furnishings in search of 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.880
 food and money ammunition with which 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:59.250
 buy the various upgrades of the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:01.170
 weapons and vigor in artistic terms 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.420
 infinite bioshock is practically 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.400
 perfect with a consistent well 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.920
 wonderful and charming in some 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.480
 his views are also spectacular 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.250
 evolution throughout history is 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.110
 perfectly outlined and we will see it 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.880
 lose of magnificence because of 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.010
 our intervention up to being 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.560
 devastated by internal struggles and falling 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.970
 prey to fire and destruction 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.040
 the developer's work in the 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.200
 return us a living and pulsating world is 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.810
 succeeded in full but unfortunately we note 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.550
 it has little variety in indoor environments 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.560
 who then expected the same tones 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.600
 dark of the first bioshock will perhaps remain 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.090
 disappointed by a much more artistic cut 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.130
 colorful and bright , sometimes from cardboard 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.900
 animated such artistic splendor is not 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.420
 but accompanied by a technical department 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.790
 at height full of textures in low 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.100
 infinite resolution suffers from scarce 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.990
 light and particle effects also 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.520
 interior is partly ruined by use 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.010
 repeated of the same elements of 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.480
 the models stand out instead 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.210
 of enemies and secondary characters 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.710
 while excellent is the work done on 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.060
 soundtrack with period music 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.810
 perfectly in line with the scenario 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.810
 quite real 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.050
 infinite bioshock stands out from the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.880
 competition in terms of history 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.860
 involvement in the narrative e 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.260
 consistency of what is represented above 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.030
 screen but above all the flower 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.830
 the pride of the game is represented 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.690
 from the incredible artistic choices to the 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.140
 base of columbia and the characters that the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.300
 live 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.010
 however there are a number of 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.680
 defects especially concerns the gameplay 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.690
 that years later it remains too much 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.520
 linked to the original bioshock without 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.950
 count the technical aspect of the game a 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.570
 traits rather backward and is a 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.000
 shame because if the incredible work 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.680
 design made directional games yes 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.050
 greater care was added 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.730
 finishing we would have found ourselves in front of 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.730
 a masterpiece of indisputable value 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.150
 it was normal top flop
