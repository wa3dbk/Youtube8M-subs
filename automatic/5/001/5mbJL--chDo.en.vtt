00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.600
 a few words about pruning the garden what I wanted 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.610
 Sang handles say it in general so 5 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:15.590
 he sent pruned fruit trees 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.789
 in our middle zone of Russia it means 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.470
 intersecting 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 a thickened acron bright error in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.109
 Generally speaking any running 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.939
 tree when several branches of one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.720
 order I mean it 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.679
 first order from the trunk suitable 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 skeletal branch 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.180
 they clearly intersect with each other 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.010
 first mistake and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 the same part of them will have to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.960
 get rid of anything else in general 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 which is rubbing between themselves this here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 it is the friction that serves to erase 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 bark and with time generally speaking under 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.420
 exposure to wind load big 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.760
 sail here is rubbing bark 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.670
 and open generally speaking meadow 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 fabric is the main source 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 contamination then shoot everyones 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.119
 pathological fungi diseases 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.520
 infections well and do not mind us 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.000
 insects eat too, in general 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 speaking while extracting juice still 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 An important factor is in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.439
 generally speaking of which we should 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.670
 to cut off 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.710
 this kind of trees is having 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 sharp corners here i can in specific 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 An example to show here on the next one is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.200
 most likely mistakes which was 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.920
 form omission some gardeners this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.439
 the presence of an acute angle where the main 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 conductor goes goes kind of rival due to 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.829
 the fact that they generally compete 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.500
 amongst ourselves we can see something about what 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.250
 they are developed about the same but 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 same rise time follow 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.960
 to the fact that there will be just under 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.509
 the impact of the fruits of the gap and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.799
 one of them will burst and grief brought 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.330
 buy principle unwanted such 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.050
 consequences we don't need what else 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.100
 say means branching off to from 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.200
 immediate tree so that was not 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.780
 sharp corners and there were no friends Oakwood 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 branch breaks need to be sent 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.860
 approximately 45 60 degrees 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.330
 relative to the center conductor and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.940
 already form them directly 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.820
 it means here to demand from this 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.430
 specific object need it 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.640
 crown thinning is very strong here 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.680
 need to form skeletal branches then 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.590
 there are tiers to form because here 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.930
 layering weakly expressed distance 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.630
 between the branches as the affairs of the 1st tier 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.190
 it is desirable to have at least half a meter but so 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.000
 as the tree is still here young then we can 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.250
 allow yourself some leave and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.490
 to be engaged in education by fury 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.140
 let's say through there 3-4 years in five 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.070
 years can depending on how 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.230
 the tree will grow 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.270
 Well, in general, something like this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.890
 mean we still want a battle 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.320
 we want to get strong here 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.080
 the skeleton of the fleet for the skeleton cell 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.519
 actually we need a little bit 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.950
 work obeying the twigs here them 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.110
 shortening as main because in 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.720
 our strip 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.820
 especially here in this particular 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.000
 the farm is very close to the banner 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.040
 groundwater and so that we and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.269
 avoid strong root growth 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.900
 generally speaking we should 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.390
 correlate 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.209
 their above ground systems i mean her 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.160
 shorten much nicer much 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.700
 put there some stool can 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 to be a little ladder than some 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.260
 Vertuuru climb and pick apples there or 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.620
 there pears no matter what any fruit 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.100
 general education at a height there 4 5 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.769
 meters so keep a compact tree in 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.300
 In general, the garden is much nicer and so 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.500
 way we can deal with criticality 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.570
 fruiting i mean getting 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.990
 ultra normal yield limits there 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.890
 baskets can be a box of fruit there 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.990
 by mass than every year than us 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.900
 getting the same thing but there with 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.470
 periodicity there are five years in four 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.090
 3 years maybe but in big 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.820
 quantity is not interesting to anyone to collect 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.800
 rotten apples there five times and not 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.600
 know where to put them but everyone is interested 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.760
 eat an apple when he actually 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:40.110
 speaking every year and in quantity 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.110
 i'm enough working with this tree 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.220
 we get such a sparse tree 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.600
 which is generally speaking 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.600
 tight in regarding his skeleton 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.260
 the sun has access anywhere 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.120
 cron illumination uniformity and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.520
 power uniformity of the total limit 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:16.930
 shading and loading fruits are already more 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:19.650
 less evenly and that is a skeleton if 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.650
 conduct 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.390
 4 hour activity 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
 futurama 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:51.340
 That's about what happens after 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.340
 crown trimming 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.130
 coastal five years strong especially 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.130
 bear a slight load of fruit 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:14.680
 thickening should be left 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:33.460
 see what you get branches and 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:36.580
 of course, all the best 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.580
 thanks again
