 culture channel in today as coupons 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.049
 not that big the big thing 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.120
 but there is a very short one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.400
 video though of this particle in the back 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.550
 The corner is every coming and that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 here that 's a train 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.349
 cartel bank as always 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 I wanted and I had a past 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 Mass to the thing is about 50 euro 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 human unit we the folder euro 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.739
 tradable 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 by the way, it's still there at the back 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.530
 in the corner now does away but if you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.480
 something really deluxe want to have yes 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
 then the thing stops how did it happen 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.899
 which they used next to these thick ones 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 brother accept it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 i had been on vacation in december 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.949
 on mallorca was the european parliament 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.949
 absolutely quiet corner is very nice there 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.289
 cala bona and cala millor and the hotel 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.059
 was so strange four suitable lux hotel 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.909
 So I found real luxe who had it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 its own power robs you seen 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.320
 tell you again in a power room 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.850
 once got this huge machine there 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 I made an extra test video that left 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.240
 We should get away it takes too long 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 and of course here with devices and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 There was still a little one in the back 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.659
 Bank handles everything possible 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 but they want to look first 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 because the baby was too fast because 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 the baby was really good for me 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 because the processing was of it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.900
 really high quality you have here too 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 the situation goes to the cylinder 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.400
 cylinder and the functioning since about 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 example cylinder you have a thick 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 fat pen because he just pulls out 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.840
 and then the bank can be wonderful from 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.909
 Move up and down 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 top so a multibank they bunting 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 You can also customize this area 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.700
 could also be in the angle from the top to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 down he has us since 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.719
 Canadian flat could lie down 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 little here in small so this 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.790
 make ajar exercises I find 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.290
 I think that's really good 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 fun to train on it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.760
 Unfortunately, the nineties had ten kilos 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.920
 act 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:20.069
 So in the gymnasium on the gymnasium 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.290
 Gymnasium in Spanish or something 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 charged or so 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.140
 yes, so zinkl wanders or ten kilos 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.110
 can make too much there then has to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.440
 repeat or or had to 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.470
 browns asleep when is it 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.909
 yet it has charged or are you here 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.720
 but to make butterflies okay mine has 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.340
 just like the workmanship and 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.530
 Maybe you know the standard 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.080
 Report china quality of this tested 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.970
 black wise stuff 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.010
 i know what my year is or is it 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.599
 stop also as deluxe so I think the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.420
 processed luxe 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.360
 thick powder pipes no sharp 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.430
 sick stable padding on it 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.989
 Things were cool here on the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.620
 website of which also means that 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:14.140
 just to bench the bench I 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.150
 God knows how much I guess 300 times 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.540
 euro or something but I have a lot 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.160
 Please, if you should start 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.670
 if he acts a bit lucky 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.519
 banking south as luck commercially just look 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.660
 with technology in order to purely that is by the way 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.470
 it is the same 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.200
 the same is the same 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.360
 I think of exactly technology in the Rhine 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 the processing of the top is something completely 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.240
 other than these balls kettler things 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.970
 because of the local market stops 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.590
 because sometimes such a bike hangs with me 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.210
 around the corner and he also has such a kettler 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.170
 trainings and then sits down 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.180
 no fear anything broken the well 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.760
 sign up china devices recognize my 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.980
 Watching other beatles is banking this 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.610
 content robust yes but they are just 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.560
 not too shapely and so what you can 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.810
 just get what my distributed but 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.130
 as possible wallpaper is also good but here 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.070
 you just do not get top 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.170
 processing but also the stability 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.690
 and the design still keep post 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.940
 bit more has mama gave me very good 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.880
 fallen next to mirror just see this 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.019
 pimpl these yellow PÃ¼mpel the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.030
 pull out and can the thing already 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.530
 make it flat or up and down the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.120
 he also picks yellow strong 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.030
 you can your little bit more positive 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.620
 wonderfully cool i know 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.490
 how the kids keep things off though 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.880
 I'm pretty much the pulpit 28 um 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.919
 my goodness that already costs like 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.910
 hard it is 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.100
 five days cut there I think so 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.020
 that makes me loose 200 kilos 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.640
 You can also use weights or something 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.960
 because that has a very, very, very 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.310
 made a robust impression 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.810
 even the screws we take the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:02.250
 screw against the disclosures that her 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.290
 knows this 4.8 6.8 8.8 pay attention to it 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.690
 the larger the number the more screws 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.270
 she does not break faster than he does 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.919
 sticks out and I have with the whole 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.840
 training equipment on the write something 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.540
 stand on it again and stood there 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.520
 I think 8.8 or something like that high 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:32.150
 on it here at the china graphics so 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:32.150
 I think I saw it there 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.750
 now you can see that the screws 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.820
 just bombastic bombastic 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.710
 hold and I think just for 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.780
 This for this hotel I thought about it 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.969
 makes more sense yes the gm once the 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.039
 Coal from are finished and the equipment 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.749
 keep talking with cheap dinger 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.610
 high caputs do not work and 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.889
 so they just keep it up 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.579
 to live also gives a little bit 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:00.539
 more is the rule 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:03.329
 neat not always everything mine 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.489
 things paid quite a lot there so 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.049
 great and sometimes what is cheaper 

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:08.610
 sometimes even better 

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:12.289
 compare but found here the quality 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.309
 really top okay if that is on Amazon 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.360
 certainly not yes if I find 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:20.639
 cabbage says really impressive 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.379
 this the the processed by the kram 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.360
 I want the coal would or money 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.169
 spend spare so what bring then so 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.059
 Technology at home ranged the crazy 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:35.029
 Only this this this this unikate 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:37.889
 Unikat is big of the page 5000 euro 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.579
 working up to 2000 euro cost looks good 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.299
 out 

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:45.269
 5000 euro costs about well the country 

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:48.029
 So if you are looking for a good bank like 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:51.110
 Technology just said the bench 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:54.179
 element plus i really liked it 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.339
 Processing absolutely top and beamed 

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:57.959
 face very nice and that this 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.419
 Adjustment has very good crisis pippal
