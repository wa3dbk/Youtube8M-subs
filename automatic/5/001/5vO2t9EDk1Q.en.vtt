00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi friends from youtube i am gs.n 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.120
 bandicoot and this is my first video with 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.830
 what when it was about 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.050
 curiosities of the video game crash 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
 bandicoot there are going to be several parts 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.210
 Well I hope you like it so 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 without further ado let's start in all the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.570
 saga is implied that the gems 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.609
 They are in greater numbers than 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.039
 crystals since the cb 1 there is no 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.800
 crystals but if there are 26 topics in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.019
 cebreros and after saving there are 25 crystals 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 and a total of 42 gems and in queens 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 sanity there are more or less six or seven 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 gems by area where you are but the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 crystals only appear every certain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 Greek time the one who makes the voice of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 water basins mind or vermouth tank is the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.200
 same actor who plays pure bone 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 in the series of the somber adventures of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 Billy and Mandy, although there are people who say 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 that the cricket penguins are not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 selling titles since this one is more black and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.719
 wear a scarf when you use attentive 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.969
 crafting they say in cup mode and their 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 dance of defeat or victory has the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 same aspect as the fb2 penguins and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 He also does not have his scarf on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 cracks wins a nicky from no line and in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.090
 hellin are the only villains that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.009
 They were 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.340
 the meeting of cortex to defeat 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.409
 crash that are bosses in the game the lyrics 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.689
 in the cortex is written in the press 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.420
 capital letter and that of his niece girl cortex 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.429
 it's in minuscule printing though 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 when it's shown in kraft wins and it and 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.209
 the scene of when Cortex was a child this one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.549
 also has the enee written in 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.619
 tiny print perhaps those of the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 cortex family have the letter in their 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.609
 head written in lowercase when they are 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.700
 children and in capital letters when they are 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.979
 adults as many will know in kraft wins 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.349
 adif and in the trap cortex did him 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.209
 back to defeat him among the enemies 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.280
 of cracks is polar that although it 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.560
 suppose it was good it appears with a bat 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 of baseball without any explanation many 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.159
 they say it's because they always crass 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.929
 I was riding but I think maybe it's 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.879
 because in warped cracks they do not take it to 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.069
 the adventure although in the same way in 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.500
 cracks ctr ball to be on the side of 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.179
 the good ones normally insurance already 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.819
 they will know that in crack if you insanity there is 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.950
 many mistakes books incomplete areas 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.259
 glitches or traces of possible levels 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 not put in the game well then I 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.459
 a long time ago I discovered a trail 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720
 how is that in the battle versus 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.670
 nefarious tropini 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 that if you look closely there is a box 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.750
 floating metal next to the jce 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 Perez may just be there by 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.800
 error but I always imagined that what 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.540
 better in that part there was going to be a way 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.550
 of metal boxes by which 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.150
 you would have to jump to get to some 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.850
 side xd in crash 1 levels in esan 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 ittibitz loom slippery clean generator 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.690
 room are the only levels that do not 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000
 they have another level equal to the physical design 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.520
 and the soundtrack in the intro of cb2 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.830
 when the cortex turns off the phosphor 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.900
 this says doug which could be a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.910
 reference to the typical phrase of homero 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.790
 simpson although it could have been mere 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.070
 coincidence this is not a curiosity 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.200
 it is more a doubt that I have that I would like 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.390
 that I solved it or is it because in cb2 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 if cortex should not let crash die 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.920
 so that this one gives him the 25 crystals 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.050
 then why the fuck are three 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.770
 bosses who try to kill crash or if a 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.380
 Rick Perry 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.390
 the brothers comfortable and time and air cute 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.520
 I tell it since it was sent to 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.220
 that crash wants the 20 crystals that 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.530
 had collected in the intro of crash 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.630
 bandicoot of dishes cortex when water 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.710
 peat where are cauca to know 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.780
 who claimed these 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.840
 in the same part where they were 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.940
 discussing in the intro of crash bass in 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.050
 the level the little crazy crash based on 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.400
 the crystal mode 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.830
 if you look very well to the left 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
 You can see the same poster with your face 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.460
 of an alien that appears in cracks 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.740
 keep the level that crush drives a 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.920
 motorcycle the same sign with which you enter 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.110
 at the secret level hot coconut in crash mind 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.970
 or vermouth and in the scene that cortex 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.370
 controls a mutant to capture a 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.350
 cauca nitro cold who was there 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.450
 says that he was the creator of the ray 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.250
 evolutionary in the first game doing 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.190
 reference to that the whole story is 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.080
 part of a videogame saga in cb 2 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.150
 there are several levels that have things from 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.920
 first game for example the level in the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.170
 which cracks uses the water table is 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.450
 quite similar to the upstream level or 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.940
 be the fifth level of crash 1 and in the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.220
 level with hard crash or level 18 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.470
 of tv2 the same rocks appear 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.500
 revolving levels jungle errors 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.960
 and rolling stones of cbn in the intro bcv 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.180
 1 cortex says file to hey do not be failing 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.700
 new hinting that he has already failed 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.800
 in something before possibly he was referring to 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.670
 failed experiment that he did as a child with 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.010
 his two birds 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.280
 appear in insanity cracks to which 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.020
 ended up sending to the tenth dimension 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 this is not a very specific curiosity 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.070
 But anyway, I will not say just in case 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.960
 in crash of the titans or at least in the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.540
 version in Spanish that was the one that I 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.430
 I played when you're going to fight with tiny this one 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.110
 he tells crush that he was still angry 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.090
 for the last game and then 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.160
 He saw that I did not invite him to see 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.990
 this scene immediately I thought that 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.210
 this could be a reference to that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.640
 tiny does not appear in the previous game or 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.470
 be crush raiting racing I know that before 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.720
 clash of the titans and after tag 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.940
 team racing came out crash human where 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.440
 tiny appeared but I do not tell 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.480
 since it has nothing to do with 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.950
 History and also what was done in Japan 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.080
 and not in your country of origin 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.090
 good going back to the scene of 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.070
 clash of the titans I do not know if it's 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.930
 indicate well says that dialogue in the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.660
 English version so I do not know if in 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.670
 really tiny said this right now I will say 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.340
 two things that I have noticed in crafting 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.410
 racing when played by two players the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.630
 first is that when playing two players 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.910
 the movement of the character becomes a 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.630
 little heavier so to speak is not 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.610
 as free as when playing a player 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.410
 second is that when playing two players 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.810
 on the snow track where it appears 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.150
 a frozen giant polar bear this one does not 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.860
 it appears mysteriously may this 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.290
 is because there would be problems with the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.330
 screen if it appears or not well this 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.190
 last I say it because once I heard that 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.170
 the track on which you compete against me 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.970
 your offside in adventure mode only 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.160
 is available to play the dea 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.110
 player then when playing the other players 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.960
 the screen would not look good due to the 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.760
 big size of the track a thing a 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.740
 so rare of cracks with sun and that is 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.510
 that is never explained as daily type 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.430
 arrives at the academy of evil and as in 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.930
 the tropic citrus cold and in the gym it 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.480
 they find out about the treasure of the tenth 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.980
 dimension however when you have not 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.050
 I remember that gem in the game and 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.910
 You get drawings or storyboards from 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.250
 game in the scene that one of the 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.020
 evil twins mentions the treasure is 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.090
 can see something that looks entropy 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.950
 spitting what came when he found out about 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.890
 treasure without even being where 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.630
 were the evil twins something 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.760
 quite meaningless but at the same time 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.710
 funny is that in the intro of crushing 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.120
 racing which you can see not squeezing 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.150
 no button in the game menu 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.110
 some of the characters appear 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.720
 building their cars 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.820
 being next to them and the funny thing here 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.830
 is that when you focus on Polar is 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.940
 reading a book on how to drive the 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.980
 book is upside down xd xd xd xd xd 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.900
 xddddd good here I finish the first 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.760
 part of my saga of curiosities of 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.310
 crash bandicoot I hope you have them 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.080
 liked as soon as I can I'll be going up 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.720
 the other parts and videos about other 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.940
 crash stuff or another topic I ask you 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.250
 that clear only if they like to comment 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.530
 light subscribe or share this 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.770
 video since that would help me a lot good 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.770
 goodbye
