guys<00:02:17.129> will<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.489> playing<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.569> I'm<00:02:18.780> going

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
guys will be playing I think I'm going

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.890 
guys will be playing I think I'm going
to<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.319> going<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.890> probably<00:02:20.879> combat<00:02:21.390> unless

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
to be going with probably combat unless

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.330 
to be going with probably combat unless
the<00:02:22.080> stealth<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.709> approved<00:02:23.040> they're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the stealth is as approved they're

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
the stealth is as approved they're
saying<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.030> might<00:02:24.209> consider<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.720> stealth

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
saying then I might consider a stealth

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
saying then I might consider a stealth
focused<00:02:25.590> assassin<00:02:26.129> but<00:02:26.849> it'd<00:02:26.909> have<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
focused assassin but it'd have to be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.550 
focused assassin but it'd have to be
some<00:02:27.390> major<00:02:27.599> improvements<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.409> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
some major improvements because the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.020 
some major improvements because the
stealth<00:02:28.799> an<00:02:28.920> assassin's<00:02:29.340> creed<00:02:29.580> has<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
stealth an assassin's creed has kind of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
stealth an assassin's creed has kind of
been<00:02:30.120> non-existent<00:02:30.299> up<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.110> point<00:02:31.379> if

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
been non-existent up to this point if

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.710 
been non-existent up to this point if
they're<00:02:32.519> all<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.910> details<00:02:33.330> they've<00:02:33.540> given

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
they're all the details they've given

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.470 
they're all the details they've given
are<00:02:34.140> true<00:02:34.440> or<00:02:34.470> whatever<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.209> stealth

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
are true or whatever then the stealth

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.479 
are true or whatever then the stealth
sounds<00:02:36.959> very<00:02:37.260> much<00:02:37.379> improved<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.980> I'm<00:02:38.190> baby

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
sounds very much improved and I'm baby

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.150 
sounds very much improved and I'm baby
bad<00:02:38.849> itself<00:02:39.299> but<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.629> enjoy<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.620> we'll

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
bad itself but I do enjoy it so we'll

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.850 
bad itself but I do enjoy it so we'll
have<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.549> how<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.700> goes<00:02:41.819> but<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> may<00:02:43.769> not

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
have to see how it goes but you may not

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.229 
have to see how it goes but you may not
necessarily<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> pick<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.120> can

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
necessarily have to pick one you can

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
necessarily have to pick one you can
probably<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.629> mix<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.200> stealth<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.860> combat

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
probably have a mix a stealth and combat

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.369 
probably have a mix a stealth and combat
sort<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.849> multi<00:02:48.209> skilled<00:02:48.510> assassin<00:02:49.110> sounds

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
sort of multi skilled assassin sounds

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.839 
sort of multi skilled assassin sounds
pretty<00:02:49.620> good<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.829> me<00:02:49.980> well<00:02:50.640> then<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
pretty good to me well then the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.640 
pretty good to me well then the
navigation<00:02:51.480> aspect<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.019> interesting<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
navigation aspect is interesting that I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.979 
navigation aspect is interesting that I
do<00:02:52.709> wonder<00:02:53.010> what<00:02:53.220> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.549> skills<00:02:53.849> will<00:02:54.540> fall

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
do wonder what kind of skills will fall

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.220 
do wonder what kind of skills will fall
into<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.500> particular<00:02:55.680> category<00:02:56.840> anyway<00:02:57.840> do

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
into that particular category anyway do

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.589 
into that particular category anyway do
let<00:02:58.410> me<00:02:58.440> know<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:59.430> category<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.450> your

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
let me know what category you think your

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.300 
let me know what category you think your
character<00:03:01.079> will<00:03:01.109> be<00:03:01.319> slotting<00:03:01.920> into<00:03:02.069> all

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
character will be slotting into all

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.940 
character will be slotting into all
categories<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.629> applies<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.319> I'll<00:03:04.769> see

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
categories if it applies and I'll see

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.489 
categories if it applies and I'll see
you<00:03:05.040> next<00:03:05.069> time
