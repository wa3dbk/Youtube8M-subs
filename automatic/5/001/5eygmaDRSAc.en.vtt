was installed and went often did

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.030 
was installed and went often did
something<00:04:57.570> else<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.500> don't<00:04:58.800> know<00:04:58.860> what<00:04:58.950> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
something else so I don't know what the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560 
something else so I don't know what the
final<00:04:59.310> part<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.550> installation<00:05:00.060> process<00:05:00.240> was

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
final part the installation process was

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.780 
final part the installation process was
like<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.020> presume<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.680> was<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.160> simple

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
like I presume it was just a simple

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.240 
like I presume it was just a simple

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250

restart as you can see I'm running ten
point<00:05:05.550> six<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:06.110> everything<00:05:07.110> was<00:05:07.500> okay<00:05:08.190> there

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
point six so everything was okay there

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.170 
point six so everything was okay there
I<00:05:09.960> think<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.010> installation<00:05:11.550> took<00:05:11.730> anything

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
I think the installation took anything

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.840 
I think the installation took anything
between<00:05:12.330> 45<00:05:13.260> minutes<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.250> an<00:05:14.370> hour<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.610> five

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
between 45 minutes to an hour and five

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.400 
between 45 minutes to an hour and five
minutes<00:05:15.210> because<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:15.510> how<00:05:15.690> long<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.080> was

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
minutes because that's how long I was

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.070 
minutes because that's how long I was
getting<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.310> mop<00:05:17.610> cut<00:05:17.880> off<00:05:18.090> what<00:05:18.690> do<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.840> think
