video I'll show you a workaround for

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.799 
video I'll show you a workaround for
earlier<00:00:27.919> versions<00:00:28.340> as<00:00:28.460> well<00:00:28.570> okay<00:00:29.570> let's

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:29.809 
earlier versions as well okay let's

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.290 
earlier versions as well okay let's
begin<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.829> tower<00:00:31.130> sequence<00:00:31.669> can<00:00:31.849> be<00:00:31.880> broken

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
begin the tower sequence can be broken

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.810 
begin the tower sequence can be broken
into<00:00:32.419> three<00:00:32.509> sections<00:00:33.250> find<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.370> tower<00:00:34.580> you

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
into three sections find the tower you

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.330 
into three sections find the tower you
will<00:00:34.850> use<00:00:35.500> reveal<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.680> tower<00:00:36.920> with<00:00:37.220> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
will use reveal the tower with the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.150 
will use reveal the tower with the
crisscross<00:00:37.580> movement<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.360> saw<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.160> finally

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
crisscross movement you saw and finally

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.960 
crisscross movement you saw and finally
move<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.580> sky<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.150> background

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
move the sky in the background

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.319 
move the sky in the background
first<00:00:43.970> let's<00:00:44.330> select<00:00:44.480> our<00:00:44.810> tower<00:00:45.080> or<00:00:45.380> building

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
first let's select our tower or building

first let's select our tower or building
the<00:00:47.329> trick<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.780> finding<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.290> good<00:00:48.470> building<00:00:48.890> is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
the trick to finding a good building is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.920 
the trick to finding a good building is
making<00:00:49.370> sure<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:49.850> contrasts<00:00:50.600> really

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
making sure that it contrasts really

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.420 
making sure that it contrasts really
well<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.380> sky<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.100> general

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
well to the sky and the general

want to use it for practice you also
don't<00:01:02.239> want<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.600> building<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.079> be<00:01:03.110> touching

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
don't want the building to be touching

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.710 
don't want the building to be touching
anything<00:01:04.070> else<00:01:04.250> or<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:05.059> any<00:01:05.239> part<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.600> it

feature of PowerPoint 2010 so because

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.760 
feature of PowerPoint 2010 so because
this<00:01:20.270> actually<00:01:20.600> had<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.930> really<00:01:21.350> clean

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
this actually had a really clean

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.399

contrast<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:22.909> worked<00:01:23.210> pretty<00:01:23.600> much<00:01:23.780> perfectly

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
contrast it worked pretty much perfectly

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.200 
contrast it worked pretty much perfectly
on<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.830> first<00:01:25.070> click<00:01:25.430> which<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.729> fairly

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
on the first click which is fairly

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.649

unusual<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.320> tool<00:01:27.620> if<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:29.060> do<00:01:29.299> end<00:01:29.570> up

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
unusual for this tool if you do end up

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.390 
unusual for this tool if you do end up
with<00:01:29.720> areas<00:01:30.229> like<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.799> aren't<00:01:31.010> marked

with areas like this that aren't marked
for<00:01:31.580> deletion<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.060> can<00:01:32.299> use<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.659> mark<00:01:32.930> areas

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
for deletion you can use the mark areas

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.560 
for deletion you can use the mark areas
to<00:01:33.650> delete<00:01:34.070> tool<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.760> remove<00:01:35.030> what<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.270> need

if you end up having to adjust it a lot

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.120 
if you end up having to adjust it a lot
you<00:01:39.140> might<00:01:39.409> want<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.830> try<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.040> different

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you might want to try a different

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.340 
you might want to try a different
picture<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.940> actually<00:01:41.420> had<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.840> try<00:01:42.049> several

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
picture I actually had to try several

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.050 
picture I actually had to try several
different<00:01:42.530> ones<00:01:42.950> before<00:01:43.369> I<00:01:43.400> settled<00:01:43.790> on<00:01:43.909> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
different ones before I settled on this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.800 
different ones before I settled on this
one<00:01:45.340> okay<00:01:46.340> before<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.790> add<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:46.970> sky<00:01:47.390> back<00:01:47.600> in

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
one okay before we add the sky back in

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.980 
one okay before we add the sky back in
let's<00:01:48.080> frame<00:01:48.680> our<00:01:48.920> picture<00:01:49.450> I'll<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:50.810> turn

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
let's frame our picture I'll just turn

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.390 
let's frame our picture I'll just turn
on<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.290> grid<00:01:51.500> line<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.920> can<00:01:51.979> see<00:01:52.250> where

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
on the grid line so you can see where

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.710 
on the grid line so you can see where
I'm<00:01:52.490> putting<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.850> frames<00:01:53.180> which<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.600> just

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
I'm putting the frames which are just

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.770 
I'm putting the frames which are just
two<00:01:54.020> skinny<00:01:54.409> rectangles<00:01:55.220> on<00:01:55.430> each<00:01:55.610> side<00:01:55.939> these

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
two skinny rectangles on each side these

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.490 
two skinny rectangles on each side these
will<00:01:57.080> be<00:01:57.200> used<00:01:57.530> for<00:01:57.799> our<00:01:57.830> criss<00:01:58.220> cross<00:01:58.549> reveal

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
will be used for our criss cross reveal

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.870 
will be used for our criss cross reveal
since<00:02:00.500> we've<00:02:00.680> removed<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.159> original<00:02:01.310> sky

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
since we've removed the original sky

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.550 
since we've removed the original sky
we're<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> create<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.689> new<00:02:02.990> sky<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
we're going to create a new sky in the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.550 
we're going to create a new sky in the
background<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.189> we<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.430> move<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.880> later<00:02:05.240> on

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
background so we can move it later on

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.050 
background so we can move it later on
this<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.770> one<00:02:07.189> sky<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.490> found<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
this is just one sky I found on the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
this is just one sky I found on the
Microsoft<00:02:08.539> Office<00:02:08.899> website<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:09.470> well

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.440 

let's<00:02:13.080> stick<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> back<00:02:14.210> resize<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
let's stick it to the back resize it to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.810 
let's stick it to the back resize it to
cover<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.930> screen<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> now<00:02:17.250> let's<00:02:17.550> stretch

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
cover the screen and now let's stretch

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.390 
cover the screen and now let's stretch
it<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.540> has<00:02:18.720> room<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.140> move<00:02:19.400> let's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it out so that has room to move let's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
it out so that has room to move let's
change<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> slide<00:02:21.180> color<00:02:21.480> from<00:02:21.690> white<00:02:21.960> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
change the slide color from white to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.560 
change the slide color from white to
make<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> look<00:02:22.710> better<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
make it look better I'm just going to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.270 
make it look better I'm just going to
put<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> black<00:02:25.020> rectangle<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> back<00:02:26.100> of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
put a black rectangle to the back of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.040 
put a black rectangle to the back of
what<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.520> currently<00:02:26.700> have

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.960 

now<00:02:32.050> I'll<00:02:32.320> group<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.800> sky<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.370> tower<00:02:33.640> to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
now I'll group the sky in the tower to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.320 
now I'll group the sky in the tower to
set<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> reveal<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:36.060> before<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.150> move

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
set up the reveal and before we move

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.820 
set up the reveal and before we move
forward<00:02:37.690> let's<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.050> duplicate<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.710> slide

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
forward let's just duplicate the slide

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.760 
forward let's just duplicate the slide
to<00:02:39.190> save<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.580> for<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> next<00:02:39.820> step<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:43.780> this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to save it for the next step at this

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.160 
to save it for the next step at this
point<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:45.280> take<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.610> sky<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.210> crop<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.960> so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
point we take the sky and crop it so

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.410 
point we take the sky and crop it so
that<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.890> stays<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.400> same<00:02:48.640> position<00:02:49.210> but

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that it stays in the same position but

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.760 
that it stays in the same position but
just<00:02:49.600> gets<00:02:49.960> shortened<00:02:52.050> these<00:02:53.050> steps<00:02:53.410> will<00:02:53.620> all

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
just gets shortened these steps will all

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:03.030 
just gets shortened these steps will all
make<00:02:53.950> sense<00:02:54.010> once<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.550> finish<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.830> great<00:03:02.830> our

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
make sense once we finish and great our

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.290 
make sense once we finish and great our
tower<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.460> now<00:03:03.610> ready<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> reveal

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
tower is now ready for the reveal

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.520 
tower is now ready for the reveal
sequence

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
sequence

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.800 
sequence
this<00:03:07.520> trick<00:03:07.850> starts<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> two<00:03:08.600> bars

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
this trick starts with the two bars

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.830 
this trick starts with the two bars
flying<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.410> from<00:03:09.560> opposite<00:03:10.010> sides<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.840> we're

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
flying in from opposite sides so we're

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.559 
flying in from opposite sides so we're
first<00:03:12.080> going<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.350> add<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> fly-in<00:03:13.459> animation<00:03:14.420> to

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
first going to add a fly-in animation to

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.930 
first going to add a fly-in animation to
both<00:03:14.720> bars<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.100> left<00:03:16.400> flying<00:03:16.760> in

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
both bars and have the left flying in

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.430 
both bars and have the left flying in
from<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> right<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:17.930> coming<00:03:18.319> in

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
from the right and the right coming in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.400 
from the right and the right coming in
from<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.680> left<00:03:19.660> now<00:03:20.660> we're<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.050> adjust

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
from the left now we're going to adjust

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.250 
from the left now we're going to adjust
these<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.680> both<00:03:22.130> start<00:03:22.610> with<00:03:22.760> previous<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
these to both start with previous and to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.970 
these to both start with previous and to
be<00:03:24.380> 1.5<00:03:25.120> seconds<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.300> duration<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:27.680> that's<00:03:27.860> an

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
be 1.5 seconds in duration but that's an

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.740 
be 1.5 seconds in duration but that's an
arbitrary<00:03:28.160> timing<00:03:28.910> feel<00:03:29.120> free<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.360> use<00:03:29.600> what

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
arbitrary timing feel free to use what

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.199 
arbitrary timing feel free to use what
works<00:03:29.959> for<00:03:30.260> your<00:03:30.530> purposes<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.670> second<00:03:32.060> key

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
works for your purposes the second key

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.630 
works for your purposes the second key
to<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:32.450> trick<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.780> using<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.290> split<00:03:33.770> animation

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
to this trick is using a split animation

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.030 
to this trick is using a split animation
on<00:03:34.850> your<00:03:35.180> tower<00:03:35.420> we<00:03:36.110> want<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.560> start<00:03:36.890> from

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
on your tower we want it to start from

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
on your tower we want it to start from
the<00:03:37.190> middle<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.459> go<00:03:37.850> out<00:03:38.060> across<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:39.170> default

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the middle and go out across the default

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.259 
the middle and go out across the default
timing<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.070> half<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.430> second<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:40.940> since<00:03:41.150> we

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
timing is half a second and since we

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.210 
timing is half a second and since we
want<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.660> end<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.410> flying<00:03:42.709> bars

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
want it to end with the flying bars

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.640 
want it to end with the flying bars
let's<00:03:43.850> give<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.269> one<00:03:44.540> second<00:03:45.019> delay<00:03:45.170> so

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
let's give it a one second delay so

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.240 
let's give it a one second delay so
everything<00:03:46.070> ends<00:03:46.370> at<00:03:46.459> 1.5<00:03:47.000> seconds<00:03:48.250> however

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
everything ends at 1.5 seconds however

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.770 
everything ends at 1.5 seconds however
you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.880> see<00:03:50.060> there's<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.300> bit<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.570> problem

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
you can see there's a bit of a problem

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.290 
you can see there's a bit of a problem
even<00:03:51.709> though<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.980> animations<00:03:52.580> end<00:03:52.819> at<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
even though the animations end at the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180 
even though the animations end at the
same<00:03:53.480> time<00:03:53.810> they<00:03:54.110> don't<00:03:54.200> look<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.769> sync

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
same time they don't look to be in sync

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.460 
same time they don't look to be in sync
so<00:03:55.790> here<00:03:56.090> comes<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.480> challenging<00:03:57.050> part<00:03:57.319> of

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
so here comes the challenging part of

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.530 
so here comes the challenging part of
syncing<00:03:57.860> them<00:03:57.980> up<00:03:58.190> at<00:03:58.400> least<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.269> level

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
syncing them up at least to a level

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
syncing them up at least to a level
where<00:03:59.690> they<00:03:59.810> look<00:04:00.019> somewhat<00:04:00.470> decent<00:04:01.000> play

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
where they look somewhat decent play

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.759 
where they look somewhat decent play
around<00:04:02.269> with<00:04:02.540> both<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.870> delay<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
around with both the delay and the

timing of the split animation until it
seems<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.890> work

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
seems to work

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.270 
seems to work

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
your anchor what worked pretty well for

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.060 
your anchor what worked pretty well for
me<00:04:13.070> was<00:04:13.340> oh<00:04:13.579> point<00:04:14.000> three<00:04:14.570> five<00:04:15.070> seconds

if<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.220> get<00:04:28.310> really<00:04:28.669> good<00:04:28.850> at<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.419> can

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
if you get really good at this you can

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.480 
if you get really good at this you can
actually<00:04:29.960> have<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> bars<00:04:30.440> flying<00:04:30.919> in<00:04:31.160> at<00:04:31.280> all

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
actually have the bars flying in at all

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.230 
actually have the bars flying in at all
four<00:04:31.910> sides<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.780> use<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> box<00:04:34.070> shape<00:04:34.520> animation

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
four sides and use a box shape animation

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.730 
four sides and use a box shape animation
with<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.539> kind<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> more<00:04:36.289> advanced

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740

version<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:39.010> now<00:04:40.010> we're<00:04:40.250> ready<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.550> move

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
version of this now we're ready to move

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.390 
version of this now we're ready to move
our<00:04:41.000> sky<00:04:41.350> let's<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.560> go<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> duplicate

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
our sky let's just go to the duplicate

our sky let's just go to the duplicate
slide<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.880> we<00:04:43.970> created<00:04:44.270> before<00:04:44.710> first<00:04:45.710> add

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
slide that we created before first add

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.920 
slide that we created before first add
another<00:04:46.340> black<00:04:46.700> rectangle<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.600> create<00:04:47.900> a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
another black rectangle to create a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.110 
another black rectangle to create a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.409 

ungroup<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.300> sky<00:04:54.250> next<00:04:55.250> add<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.640> motion<00:04:56.060> path

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
ungroup the sky next add a motion path

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.810 
ungroup the sky next add a motion path
to<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.020> stretches<00:04:57.560> out<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.100> left

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.400 

make<00:05:01.820> sure<00:05:02.000> it's<00:05:02.150> completely<00:05:02.630> straight<00:05:03.169> by

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
make sure it's completely straight by

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.640 
make sure it's completely straight by
holding<00:05:03.830> down<00:05:03.950> shift<00:05:04.370> as<00:05:04.640> you're<00:05:04.880> dragging<00:05:05.300> it

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
holding down shift as you're dragging it

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.870 
holding down shift as you're dragging it
we're<00:05:06.650> going<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.800> extend<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.370> time<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.789> the

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
we're going to extend the time of the

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.969 
we're going to extend the time of the
motion<00:05:08.060> path<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.660> 10<00:05:08.960> seconds<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.770> the

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
motion path to 10 seconds so that the

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.110 
motion path to 10 seconds so that the
sky<00:05:10.220> doesn't<00:05:10.460> fly<00:05:10.850> by<00:05:11.060> too<00:05:11.120> fast

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
sky doesn't fly by too fast

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.540 
sky doesn't fly by too fast
okay<00:05:13.900> all<00:05:14.110> we<00:05:14.260> need<00:05:14.410> now<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.919> create<00:05:15.130> one

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
okay all we need now is to create one

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.370 
okay all we need now is to create one
more<00:05:15.760> screen<00:05:16.270> on<00:05:16.480> the<00:05:16.630> left<00:05:16.840> side<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.139> that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
more screen on the left side so that

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.290 
more screen on the left side so that
covers<00:05:17.919> up<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.100> sky<00:05:18.430> as<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.820> moves<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.240> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
covers up the sky as it moves to the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.230 
covers up the sky as it moves to the
left

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
left

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.939 
left
and<00:05:21.710> send<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> sky<00:05:23.039> to<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.250> back<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.949> there

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
and send the sky to the back and there

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.189 
and send the sky to the back and there
you<00:05:26.069> go<00:05:26.250> you're<00:05:26.490> done<00:05:26.840> here's<00:05:27.840> what<00:05:28.050> we've

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
you go you're done here's what we've

made so now I want to show you how to do

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.400 
made so now I want to show you how to do
the<00:05:32.940> windows<00:05:33.300> sequence<00:05:33.720> because<00:05:33.990> it's<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.199> bit

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
the windows sequence because it's a bit

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.589 
the windows sequence because it's a bit
easier<00:05:34.860> for<00:05:34.949> earlier<00:05:35.520> PowerPoint<00:05:36.150> versions

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
easier for earlier PowerPoint versions

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.749 
easier for earlier PowerPoint versions
and<00:05:36.780> because<00:05:37.110> it's<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.319> useful<00:05:37.770> skill<00:05:38.099> for<00:05:38.130> 2010

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
and because it's a useful skill for 2010

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
white this picture I also got from the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.540 
white this picture I also got from the
office<00:05:50.460> website<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:51.650> this<00:05:52.650> is<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:53.069> simple

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
office website and this is very simple

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.290 
office website and this is very simple
you<00:05:53.699> just<00:05:53.729> click<00:05:53.970> set<00:05:54.750> transparent<00:05:55.620> color<00:05:55.889> and

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
you just click set transparent color and

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.260 
you just click set transparent color and
you're<00:05:57.300> basically<00:05:57.720> done<00:05:58.729> let's<00:05:59.729> just<00:05:59.940> tone

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
you're basically done let's just tone

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.969 
you're basically done let's just tone
down<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.750> sky<00:06:00.990> color<00:06:01.289> so<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.710> blends

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
down the sky color so that it blends

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.110 
down the sky color so that it blends
better<00:06:02.220> with<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.550> window<00:06:02.819> and<00:06:03.349> here<00:06:04.349> it<00:06:04.440> is

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
better with the window and here it is

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.760 
better with the window and here it is
now<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.150> promised<00:06:06.690> earlier<00:06:07.050> version<00:06:07.470> users
