00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.520 
I think we got it
please<00:03:20.120> yes<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.359> made<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.569> alright<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.470> you

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
please yes we made it alright so you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.259 
please yes we made it alright so you
finally<00:03:22.829> did<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.129> under<00:03:23.250> BMX<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:23.879> just<00:03:24.090> stick

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
finally did it under BMX that just stick

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
finally did it under BMX that just stick
to<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.480> side<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> whole<00:03:24.989> time<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.590> guess<00:03:26.010> with

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
to the side the whole time I guess with

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.319 
to the side the whole time I guess with
smaller<00:03:26.459> vehicles<00:03:26.879> it's<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.060> little<00:03:27.239> bit

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
smaller vehicles it's a little bit

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.400 
smaller vehicles it's a little bit
easier<00:03:27.419> because<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.989> stick<00:03:28.199> to<00:03:28.319> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
easier because you can stick to the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.289 
easier because you can stick to the
edges<00:03:28.530> but<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:28.919> bigger<00:03:29.099> vehicles<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.879> think

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
edges but with bigger vehicles I think

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.460 
edges but with bigger vehicles I think
it's<00:03:30.389> gonna<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.660> bit<00:03:30.810> more<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> challenge

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it's gonna be a bit more of a challenge

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.610 
it's gonna be a bit more of a challenge
so<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.699> it's<00:03:32.819> already<00:03:33.120> slide<00:03:33.359> let's<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.870> we've

I mean I think we've met alright so we
made<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.639> to<00:05:55.729> the<00:05:55.880> bottom<00:05:56.120> we<00:05:56.240> didn't<00:05:56.419> make<00:05:56.479> it

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
made it to the bottom we didn't make it

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.120 
made it to the bottom we didn't make it
in<00:05:56.690> time<00:05:56.750> because<00:05:57.169> if<00:05:57.259> I<00:05:57.319> slow<00:05:57.590> this<00:05:57.740> thing<00:05:57.800> is

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
in time because if I slow this thing is

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.620 
in time because if I slow this thing is
but<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.639> mean<00:05:58.940> that's<00:05:59.029> a<00:05:59.150> pretty<00:05:59.240> good<00:05:59.479> run

but<00:06:48.950> it's<00:06:49.070> in<00:06:49.220> dictionary<00:06:49.730> me<00:06:49.790> a<00:06:50.000> lot<00:06:50.120> easier

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
but it's in dictionary me a lot easier

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.850

than<00:06:50.480> the<00:06:50.570> last<00:06:50.720> one<00:06:50.930> it's<00:06:51.440> just<00:06:51.500> a<00:06:51.650> matter<00:06:51.770> of

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
than the last one it's just a matter of

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.409

going<00:06:51.980> left<00:06:52.250> or<00:06:52.400> right<00:06:52.580> pretty<00:06:52.820> much<00:06:53.000> obvious

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
going left or right pretty much obvious

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.540 
going left or right pretty much obvious
