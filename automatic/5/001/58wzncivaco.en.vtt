hair twice and the smell was gone I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.260 
hair twice and the smell was gone I
don't<00:02:56.709> know<00:02:56.800> why<00:02:57.010> sometimes<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.760> happens<00:02:57.910> I

don't know why sometimes that happens I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.760 
don't know why sometimes that happens I
guess<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.630> just<00:02:58.660> depends<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.470> dye<00:02:59.709> is

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
guess it just depends on what dye is

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.010 
guess it just depends on what dye is
being<00:03:00.250> used<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.270> happens<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.750> way

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
being used it just happens that way

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.160 
being used it just happens that way
sometimes<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> washed<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.880> twice<00:03:04.180> I'm<00:03:04.720> going
