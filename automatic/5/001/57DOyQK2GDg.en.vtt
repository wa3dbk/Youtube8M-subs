00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.730 
stupid star out there in the meow
because<00:00:24.210> usually<00:00:24.600> Gliscor<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> pretty

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
because usually Gliscor is a pretty

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
because usually Gliscor is a pretty
decent<00:00:26.220> counter<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> those<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:28.050> one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

that does way too much because someone's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
that does way too much because someone's
pretty<00:01:50.189> much<00:01:50.399> already<00:01:50.610> dead<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:52.409> trying

he's<00:03:00.630> gonna<00:03:00.750> go<00:03:00.930> into<00:03:01.140> latias<00:03:01.470> as<00:03:01.769> i<00:03:01.890> go<00:03:02.040> for

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
he's gonna go into latias as i go for

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.000 
he's gonna go into latias as i go for
thunderbolt<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.150> para<00:03:03.420> hags<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.010> I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
thunderbolt but I get para hags and I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130 
thunderbolt but I get para hags and I
guess<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.700> was<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> decent<00:03:06.060> move<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:06.600> now<00:03:06.810> he

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
guess I was a decent move because now he

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.800 
guess I was a decent move because now he
used<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.440> bring<00:03:07.560> my<00:03:07.769> sub<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.250> his<00:03:08.790> latias<00:03:09.239> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
used to bring my sub and his latias you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.470 
used to bring my sub and his latias you
know<00:03:09.959> his<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.440> pretty<00:03:10.800> much<00:03:10.860> full<00:03:11.130> HP<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:12.180> I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
know his at pretty much full HP but I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.820 
know his at pretty much full HP but I
don't<00:03:12.750> know<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.080> risk<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.620> cuz

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
don't know if I would risk that cuz

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.759 
don't know if I would risk that cuz
maybe<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.480> magazine<00:03:15.480> does<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.840> high<00:03:16.050> base

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
maybe the magazine does have high base

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.949 
maybe the magazine does have high base
defense<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.060> u-turn<00:03:18.360> might<00:03:18.660> not<00:03:18.840> have

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
defense so the u-turn might not have

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.620 
defense so the u-turn might not have
broken<00:03:19.260> myself<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.670> guess<00:03:21.299> he<00:03:21.450> doesn't

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
broken myself but I guess he doesn't

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.300 
broken myself but I guess he doesn't
really<00:03:21.810> care<00:03:21.900> cuz<00:03:22.320> his<00:03:22.530> latios<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.100> called

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
really care cuz his latios it's called

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.890 
really care cuz his latios it's called
mine<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.760> he<00:03:23.880> could<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.209> much<00:03:24.299> set<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.720> on

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
mine so he could pretty much set up on

is<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.870> right<00:04:22.080> now<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.229> should<00:04:22.470> have<00:04:22.560> given<00:04:22.770> a

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
is that right now I should have given a

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.060 
is that right now I should have given a
one<00:04:23.039> AKO<00:04:23.310> with<00:04:23.520> an<00:04:23.669> extreme<00:04:24.030> speed

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
one AKO with an extreme speed

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.190 
one AKO with an extreme speed
he<00:04:25.430> decided<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> go<00:04:26.150> for<00:04:26.300> fake<00:04:26.600> out<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> then

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
he decided to go for fake out and then

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440 
he decided to go for fake out and then
he<00:04:27.560> u-turns<00:04:28.010> here<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.700> really<00:04:29.270> random

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
he u-turns here for a really random

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.930 
he u-turns here for a really random
reason<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:30.200> guess<00:04:30.920> he<00:04:31.040> figured<00:04:31.370> I'd<00:04:31.490> go<00:04:31.670> into

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
reason I guess he figured I'd go into

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.110 
reason I guess he figured I'd go into
dragonite<00:04:32.630> since<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.170> later<00:04:33.410> found<00:04:33.650> out<00:04:33.950> that

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
dragonite since I later found out that

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.110 
dragonite since I later found out that
his<00:04:35.120> mienshao<00:04:35.480> isn't<00:04:36.080> carrying<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:37.120> rock-type

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
his mienshao isn't carrying a rock-type

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.210 
his mienshao isn't carrying a rock-type
move<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.900> my<00:04:39.050> dry<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.440> pretty<00:04:39.650> much<00:04:39.740> walls

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
move so my dry and I pretty much walls

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.400 
move so my dry and I pretty much walls
him<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.180> guess<00:04:41.540> what<00:04:42.140> he<00:04:42.230> was<00:04:42.350> thinking

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
him so I guess what he was thinking

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.290 
him so I guess what he was thinking
there's<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> would<00:04:43.430> go<00:04:43.580> into<00:04:43.730> dragonite

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
there's that I would go into dragonite

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.020 
there's that I would go into dragonite
but<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:44.930> had<00:04:45.230> no<00:04:45.560> reason<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:46.040> do<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.190> since<00:04:46.610> at

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
but I had no reason to do that since at

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270 
but I had no reason to do that since at
that<00:04:47.420> point<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.020> battle<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.560> didn't<00:04:49.250> know

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
that point of the battle I didn't know

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.640 
that point of the battle I didn't know
that<00:04:49.370> his<00:04:49.700> yeah<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.690> fighting<00:04:51.080> moves<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.440> turn

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
that his yeah to fighting moves you turn

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.850 
that his yeah to fighting moves you turn
and<00:04:51.830> then<00:04:51.920> faked<00:04:52.160> out<00:04:52.430> so<00:04:53.470> yeah<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.680> was

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
and then faked out so yeah it was

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.620 
and then faked out so yeah it was
basically<00:04:55.250> no<00:04:55.670> reason<00:04:56.030> for<00:04:56.180> me<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.330> switch

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
basically no reason for me to switch

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.260 
basically no reason for me to switch
into<00:04:56.780> dry<00:04:57.110> night<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.500> don't<00:04:58.100> care<00:04:58.700> though<00:04:58.940> I'm
