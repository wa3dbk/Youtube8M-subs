is<00:00:14.629> going<00:00:14.779> to<00:00:14.869> be<00:00:15.020> a<00:00:15.049> pretty<00:00:15.439> short<00:00:15.590> one

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
is going to be a pretty short one

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.800 
is going to be a pretty short one
because<00:00:16.670> there<00:00:16.880> aren't<00:00:17.029> really<00:00:17.180> any<00:00:17.300> major

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
because there aren't really any major

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.349 
because there aren't really any major
updates<00:00:18.199> or<00:00:18.320> changes<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:18.920> talk<00:00:19.100> about<00:00:19.279> most<00:00:20.180> of

updates or changes to talk about most of

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.390 
updates or changes to talk about most of
the<00:00:20.480> models<00:00:20.660> got<00:00:21.320> there<00:00:21.740> nine<00:00:22.100> point<00:00:22.340> two

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
the models got there nine point two

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.460 
the models got there nine point two
versions<00:00:22.940> out<00:00:23.150> fairly<00:00:23.630> quickly<00:00:23.750> but<00:00:24.140> that's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
versions out fairly quickly but that's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.350 
versions out fairly quickly but that's
because<00:00:24.650> i<00:00:24.800> think<00:00:24.860> they<00:00:25.039> weren't<00:00:25.310> really<00:00:26.150> any

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
because i think they weren't really any

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.100 
because i think they weren't really any
major<00:00:26.630> changes<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.289> the<00:00:27.410> game<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.990> there<00:00:29.990> was

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
major changes to the game so there was

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.409 
major changes to the game so there was
some<00:00:30.470> minor<00:00:30.710> things<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:31.070> do<00:00:31.220> but<00:00:31.580> compared<00:00:32.359> to

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
some minor things to do but compared to

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.889 
some minor things to do but compared to
last<00:00:32.599> time<00:00:32.809> when<00:00:33.140> some<00:00:33.469> of<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.620> vods<00:00:33.770> took<00:00:34.190> a

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
last time when some of the vods took a

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.329 
last time when some of the vods took a
few<00:00:35.899> days<00:00:36.109> at<00:00:36.289> least<00:00:36.320> although<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.159> wasn't

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
few days at least although that wasn't

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.619 
few days at least although that wasn't
the<00:00:37.519> reason<00:00:37.640> for<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> delay<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:38.300> last<00:00:38.420> time

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
the reason for the delay the last time

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.979 
the reason for the delay the last time
that<00:00:38.659> was<00:00:38.960> all<00:00:39.289> down<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.469> me<00:00:39.819> so<00:00:40.819> yeah<00:00:41.749> there

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
that was all down to me so yeah there

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.840 
that was all down to me so yeah there
aren't<00:00:42.140> really<00:00:42.379> any<00:00:42.530> major<00:00:42.859> changes<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.609> only

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
aren't really any major changes the only

conflict that has actually changed a bit
it<00:00:51.679> looks<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:52.039> bit<00:00:52.159> different<00:00:52.219> now<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.870> the

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
it looks a bit different now that the

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.899 
it looks a bit different now that the

major change you will notice is that
there<00:00:56.539> are<00:00:56.569> now<00:00:57.260> two<00:00:58.190> circles<00:00:58.819> if<00:00:59.089> you're

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
there are now two circles if you're

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:00.879 
there are now two circles if you're
running<00:00:59.719> with<00:00:59.839> binoculars<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.679> inner

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
running with binoculars and the inner

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:02.829 
running with binoculars and the inner
circle<00:01:01.069> is<00:01:01.339> your<00:01:01.519> usual<00:01:01.670> view<00:01:01.999> range<00:01:02.179> and<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
circle is your usual view range and the

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.359 
circle is your usual view range and the
outer<00:01:02.989> circle<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.709> your<00:01:03.889> view<00:01:04.040> range<00:01:04.220> with

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
outer circle is your view range with

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.649 
outer circle is your view range with
binoculars<00:01:04.909> which<00:01:05.030> i<00:01:05.119> think<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.420> nice

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
binoculars which i think is a nice

little change there are some things like

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.720 
little change there are some things like
i<00:01:08.870> said<00:01:09.050> with<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.500> vanilla<00:01:09.680> conflict<00:01:10.580> that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
i said with the vanilla conflict that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.770 
i said with the vanilla conflict that
are<00:01:10.790> different<00:01:11.060> as<00:01:11.150> well<00:01:11.300> there's<00:01:11.540> actually

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
are different as well there's actually

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.980 
are different as well there's actually
an<00:01:11.870> optional<00:01:12.430> second<00:01:13.430> circle<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.870> can

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
an optional second circle that you can

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.860 
an optional second circle that you can
add<00:01:15.170> at<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> fixed<00:01:15.890> view<00:01:16.190> range<00:01:16.400> by<00:01:16.700> default<00:01:17.210> it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
add at a fixed view range by default it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.500 
add at a fixed view range by default it
is<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.410> like<00:01:18.620> 4<00:01:18.860> 45<00:01:19.100> which<00:01:19.730> is<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.030> course<00:01:20.120> the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
is in like 4 45 which is of course the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.990 
is in like 4 45 which is of course the
maximum<00:01:21.050> view<00:01:21.860> range<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.250> any<00:01:22.400> tank<00:01:22.760> i

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
maximum view range of any tank i

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.970 
maximum view range of any tank i
actually<00:01:23.810> took<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.080> out<00:01:24.200> because<00:01:24.320> i<00:01:24.470> found<00:01:24.800> it

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
actually took it out because i found it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.650 
actually took it out because i found it
a<00:01:25.040> bit<00:01:25.070> distracting<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:25.910> decided<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.390> didn't

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
a bit distracting I decided I didn't

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.420 
a bit distracting I decided I didn't
need<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.840> but<00:01:27.290> that's<00:01:27.890> something<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.280> can

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
need that but that's something you can

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.030 
need that but that's something you can
poke<00:01:28.610> around<00:01:28.760> in<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.150> mini-map<00:01:29.750> XML<00:01:30.410> file<00:01:30.740> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
poke around in the mini-map XML file and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.740 
poke around in the mini-map XML file and
actually<00:01:31.400> change<00:01:31.760> for<00:01:31.910> yourself<00:01:32.300> or<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.630> can

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
actually change for yourself or you can

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.540 
actually change for yourself or you can
also<00:01:33.110> adjust<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.620> colors<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.040> your<00:01:34.160> liking

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
also adjust the colors to your liking

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.630
