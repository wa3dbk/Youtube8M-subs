practice<00:03:13.359> practice<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:15.690> some<00:03:16.690> days<00:03:16.870> it's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
practice practice and some days it's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.430

better<00:03:17.440> than<00:03:18.010> others<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.930> let<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.140> dry<00:03:20.410> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
better than others then I let it dry a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.319 
better than others then I let it dry a

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
little bit so while it's drying I move

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.080 
little bit so while it's drying I move
on<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.750> another<00:03:22.900> part<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.560> my<00:03:23.680> makeup<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.700> I'm
