got<00:02:22.820> our<00:02:22.850> tipper<00:02:23.359> and<00:02:24.160> obviously<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.519> use

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
got our tipper and obviously you can use

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900 
got our tipper and obviously you can use
this<00:02:25.880> tipper<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:27.079> carry<00:02:27.560> grain<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.280> Silas<00:02:28.880> or

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
this tipper to carry grain and Silas or

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.520 
this tipper to carry grain and Silas or
wherever<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.600> want<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.840> carry<00:02:30.079> wood

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
wherever it is you want to carry wood

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.449 
wherever it is you want to carry wood
chips<00:02:30.859> so<00:02:32.049> what<00:02:33.049> I<00:02:33.079> do<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.980> I'll<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.220> drop

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
chips so what I do is I'll just drop

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.860 
chips so what I do is I'll just drop
that<00:02:34.519> off<00:02:34.730> again<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.239> can<00:02:35.269> pick<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.630> another

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that off again so we can pick up another

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.199 
that off again so we can pick up another
one<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:37.690> again<00:02:38.690> exactly<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.470> same<00:02:39.650> principle

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
one and again exactly the same principle

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.569 
one and again exactly the same principle
we're<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.359> pulling<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.720> onto<00:02:42.609> our<00:02:43.609> trailer

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
we're just pulling up onto our trailer

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.599 
we're just pulling up onto our trailer
you<00:02:46.579> can<00:02:46.760> even<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.390> suspension<00:02:47.870> lowering

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
you can even see the suspension lowering

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.370 
you can even see the suspension lowering
when<00:02:49.609> it<00:02:49.730> pulls<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.390> back<00:02:50.630> obviously

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
when it pulls up on the back obviously

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.569 
when it pulls up on the back obviously
it's<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> lot<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.739> weight<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.190> back<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.489> is

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
it's a lot of weight on the back one is

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.460 
it's a lot of weight on the back one is
pulling<00:02:52.880> up<00:02:53.030> especially<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.500> full

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
pulling up especially if it's full

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.360 
pulling up especially if it's full
because<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.799> can<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.130> course<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.640> multiple

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
because you can of course have multiple

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.920 
because you can of course have multiple
attachments<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.389> can<00:03:02.540> take<00:03:02.690> them<00:03:02.840> off

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
attachments and you can take them off

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.949 
attachments and you can take them off
put<00:03:03.170> them<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.760> dump<00:03:04.760> them<00:03:04.910> places<00:03:05.359> you<00:03:05.569> can

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
put them on dump them places you can

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.809 
put them on dump them places you can
even<00:03:06.109> put<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.470> tipper<00:03:07.130> at<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> side<00:03:07.639> of<00:03:07.670> a

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
even put the tipper at the side of a

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.360 
even put the tipper at the side of a
field<00:03:08.030> for<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> combine

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
field for a combine

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.119 
field for a combine
and<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:11.780> multiple<00:03:12.319> ones<00:03:12.379> of<00:03:12.620> them<00:03:12.799> come<00:03:13.099> back

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
and have multiple ones of them come back

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.960 
and have multiple ones of them come back
to<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.580> pick<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.909> up<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.209> its<00:03:14.299> fold<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:15.970> grant

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
to it pick it up in its fold and grant

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.729 
to it pick it up in its fold and grant
it<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.659> that's<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.049> nice<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.010> idea<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:20.739> yeah

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
it so that's a nice little idea and yeah

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.800 
it so that's a nice little idea and yeah
there<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.220> our<00:03:22.430> forestry<00:03:23.330> wall<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
there we have our forestry wall and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.990 
there we have our forestry wall and
you'd<00:03:24.500> need<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.739> teleport<00:03:25.310> or<00:03:25.519> something<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
you'd need a teleport or something to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.470 
you'd need a teleport or something to
load<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.079> up<00:03:27.849> drop<00:03:28.849> this<00:03:28.940> one<00:03:29.120> off<00:03:29.209> now<00:03:29.360> as

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
load that up drop this one off now as

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.059 
load that up drop this one off now as
well<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:31.220> pick<00:03:31.519> up<00:03:31.670> our<00:03:31.819> final<00:03:32.299> attachment

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
well and pick up our final attachment

well and pick up our final attachment
which<00:03:34.069> is<00:03:34.099> of<00:03:34.760> course<00:03:34.940> our<00:03:35.269> flatbed<00:03:35.829> now<00:03:36.829> all

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
which is of course our flatbed now all

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.589 
which is of course our flatbed now all
of<00:03:37.190> these<00:03:37.310> attachments<00:03:38.000> do<00:03:38.150> actually<00:03:38.480> have

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
of these attachments do actually have

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.050 
of these attachments do actually have
maintenance<00:03:38.989> per<00:03:39.470> day<00:03:39.739> it's<00:03:40.489> not<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
maintenance per day it's not for the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.119 
maintenance per day it's not for the
whole<00:03:41.239> pack<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.319> pay<00:03:42.950> your

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
whole pack you have to pay your

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.220 
whole pack you have to pay your
maintenance<00:03:43.459> fee<00:03:43.940> for<00:03:44.359> each<00:03:44.480> attachment<00:03:44.870> that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
maintenance fee for each attachment that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.030 
maintenance fee for each attachment that
you<00:03:45.290> own<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.569> obviously<00:03:47.569> if<00:03:47.840> you're<00:03:48.170> just

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
you own so obviously if you're just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.650 
you own so obviously if you're just
starting<00:03:49.250> off<00:03:49.549> on<00:03:49.730> your<00:03:49.849> farm<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.299> don't<00:03:50.510> want

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
starting off on your farm you don't want

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.470 
starting off on your farm you don't want
to<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:50.840> buying<00:03:51.799> about<00:03:51.980> 10<00:03:52.910> of<00:03:53.030> each<00:03:53.120> attachment

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
to be buying about 10 of each attachment

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.630 
to be buying about 10 of each attachment
because<00:03:54.019> your<00:03:54.260> maintenance<00:03:54.980> fees<00:03:55.220> are<00:03:55.489> going

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
because your maintenance fees are going

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.149 
because your maintenance fees are going
to<00:03:55.700> go<00:03:55.790> through<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> roof<00:03:56.590> but<00:03:57.590> it's

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
to go through the roof but it's

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.949 
to go through the roof but it's
definitely<00:03:58.609> not<00:03:58.909> too<00:03:59.299> much<00:03:59.480> today<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.780> think

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
definitely not too much today I think

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.660 
definitely not too much today I think
it's<00:04:00.170> about<00:04:00.319> 15<00:04:00.769> pounds<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.250> day<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:03.579> one<00:04:04.579> of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
it's about 15 pounds a day for one of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.039 
it's about 15 pounds a day for one of
the<00:04:04.760> smaller<00:04:05.060> attachments<00:04:05.599> probably<00:04:05.900> this

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
the smaller attachments probably this

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.220 
the smaller attachments probably this
flatbed<00:04:06.290> actually<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:10.720> we'll<00:04:11.720> get<00:04:11.870> up<00:04:12.049> to

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
flatbed actually and we'll get up to

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.270 
flatbed actually and we'll get up to
here<00:04:12.470> Oh<00:04:14.319> bit<00:04:15.319> too<00:04:15.500> far<00:04:15.709> away<00:04:15.829> that's<00:04:16.070> why<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
here Oh bit too far away that's why it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:31.600 
here Oh bit too far away that's why it
jumped

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610
