00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mobile gun as well so let's take a look

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
mobile gun as well so let's take a look
at<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> stats<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.690> these<00:00:51.899> rumors

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
at the stats and see if these rumors

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.139 
at the stats and see if these rumors
hold<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.829> let's<00:00:53.160> start<00:00:53.399> out<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> damage

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hold up let's start out with the damage

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.229 
hold up let's start out with the damage
it<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> damage<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.370> 5217<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> statistically

it is a damage of 5217 and statistically
speaking<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> tied<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.530> weakest<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
speaking it is tied for the weakest of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.910 
speaking it is tied for the weakest of
shotguns<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> damage<00:01:00.719> however<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.289> aspect

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
shotguns and damage however that aspect

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
shotguns and damage however that aspect
is<00:01:02.039> made<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> multiple<00:01:03.329> categories

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is made up for in multiple categories

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
is made up for in multiple categories
will<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> those<00:01:04.260> further<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
will get to those further on but it is a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510 
will get to those further on but it is a
225<00:01:06.390> shot<00:01:06.780> kill<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.830> multipliers<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
225 shot kill now as for multipliers and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
225 shot kill now as for multipliers and
damage<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.510> shotguns<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.260> they're<00:01:10.500> not

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
damage because shotguns if they're not

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.679 
damage because shotguns if they're not
slugs<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.250> spray<00:01:11.610> everywhere<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.360> no

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
slugs they spray everywhere there are no

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
slugs they spray everywhere there are no
real<00:01:12.869> advantage<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.320> damage<00:01:13.860> multipliers

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
real advantage to damage multipliers

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
real advantage to damage multipliers
everything<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> body<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> 1<00:01:16.470> point<00:01:16.740> 0

the<00:01:17.250> entire<00:01:17.610> way<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the entire way around so there really is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
the entire way around so there really is
no<00:01:19.470> statistical<00:01:20.100> advantage<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.729> aiming<00:01:21.060> at

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
no statistical advantage for aiming at

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
no statistical advantage for aiming at
the<00:01:21.210> head<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.869> differentiating<00:01:22.680> from<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> leg

the head or differentiating from the leg
now<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> range<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> gun

now as for the range of this gun
shotguns<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> can't<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:25.920> expect<00:01:26.369> too

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
shotguns you can't really expect too

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580 
shotguns you can't really expect too
much<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.210> point-blank<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> two-shot

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
much of but point-blank it is a two-shot

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
much of but point-blank it is a two-shot
kill<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.009> where<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> 50<00:01:29.610> damage<00:01:29.850> comes

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
up all the way to nine shells so that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.350 
up all the way to nine shells so that
may<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.649> seem<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> lot<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
may not seem like a lot but really it is

may not seem like a lot but really it is
when<00:01:51.689> placed<00:01:51.990> into<00:01:52.409> practical<00:01:53.070> terms<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
when placed into practical terms this is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
when placed into practical terms this is
a<00:01:53.850> gun<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.180> you'll<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.329> reloading

really sets this weapon apart from all
the<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.439> shotguns<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.640> rate<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> fire

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the other shotguns is the rate of fire

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779

shotguns now as for the recoil it is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.750 
shotguns now as for the recoil it is
relatively<00:02:57.560> high<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.190> mobility<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.610> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
right of them 10 and a Down of 65 so use

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.820 
right of them 10 and a Down of 65 so use
that<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.930> want<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.380> will<00:03:09.530> pull<00:03:09.739> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
that how you want it will pull you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.890 
that how you want it will pull you
Northwest<00:03:10.459> in<00:03:10.640> direction<00:03:11.330> on<00:03:11.480> your<00:03:11.660> display

Northwest in direction on your display

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.750 
Northwest in direction on your display
but<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.560> said<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.830> mobility<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> gun

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
but like I said the mobility of the gun

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.550 
but like I said the mobility of the gun
and<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.150> practical<00:03:14.660> uses<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.350> running

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and the practical uses of it running

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.260 
and the practical uses of it running
around<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.100> spraying<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.700> doesn't<00:03:17.090> really

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
around and spraying it doesn't really

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.090 
around and spraying it doesn't really
make<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.840> noticeable<00:03:18.110> now<00:03:18.680> let's<00:03:18.890> close

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
make it that noticeable now let's close

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.680 
make it that noticeable now let's close

definitely<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.299> muzzle<00:03:23.810> brake<00:03:24.049> if<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.380> don't

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
definitely a muzzle brake if you don't

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.229 
definitely a muzzle brake if you don't
you're<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.010> hurting<00:03:25.310> any<00:03:25.580> chances<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.150> you

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
you're just hurting any chances that you

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.940 
you're just hurting any chances that you
have<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.660> make<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.049> weapon<00:03:27.440> even<00:03:27.590> more

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
have to make this weapon even more

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
have to make this weapon even more
overpowered<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:28.790> adds<00:03:28.940> great<00:03:29.269> range<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.720> terms

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
overpowered it adds great range in terms

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.900 
overpowered it adds great range in terms
of<00:03:30.140> shotguns<00:03:30.680> even<00:03:31.070> if<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.370> only<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.640> few

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
of shotguns even if it is only a few

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
of shotguns even if it is only a few
more<00:03:32.090> meters<00:03:32.360> next<00:03:32.780> sleight<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.200> hand<00:03:33.530> is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
more meters next sleight of hand is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.259 
more meters next sleight of hand is
definitely<00:03:33.830> do<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.220> for<00:03:34.549> quicker<00:03:34.760> reloading

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
definitely do that for quicker reloading

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.750 
definitely do that for quicker reloading
agility<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.930> or<00:03:36.230> marathoners<00:03:36.769> also<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.340> viable

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
agility and or marathoners also a viable

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.789 
agility and or marathoners also a viable
option<00:03:37.970> quicker<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.810> longer<00:03:39.200> sprinting<00:03:39.680> is

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
option quicker and longer sprinting is

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.080 
option quicker and longer sprinting is
always<00:03:40.160> awesome<00:03:40.370> when<00:03:40.700> you're<00:03:40.820> trying<00:03:41.000> to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
always awesome when you're trying to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.729

situations<00:03:43.370> on<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:44.060> go<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.299> would<00:03:44.660> definitely

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
situations on the go I would definitely

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
situations on the go I would definitely
recommend<00:03:45.110> for<00:03:45.890> reloading<00:03:46.190> while<00:03:46.459> sprinting

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
recommend for reloading while sprinting

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.940 
recommend for reloading while sprinting
is<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.480> great<00:03:47.780> addition<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.410> any<00:03:48.620> class

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
is optional because it's not really

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.380
