00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.259
 hey you love I'm just standing in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.109
 my kitchen and I thought I could 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.480
 take you once and show you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.309
 as I have high broccoli it because I have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 not really recommend me for a long time 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.719
 ran dared to rest a problem you thought 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 anyway that does not taste like that because you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 has already snacked broccoli if 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 Cut him for fighting 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 or for cooking 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.390
 and if you have tried then then 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390
 one has determined 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.680
 and the tip is actually people 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 arrives at the dressing 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 First of all must say tube broccoli 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.840
 has many advantages 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 just as far as the liver function is concerned 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 We blew it right again 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.770
 Link a video from the dock 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
 contracts between fixed point in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.250
 infobox 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 where he actually left the link anyway 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.350
 facebook page is because the easy 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 Anyhow it is dry 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.539
 also dressing ghana I show you once 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.340
 what I did today 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.430
 and I already have a lot 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 Eaten away and wanted you but 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.740
 yet again so I have to show 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 a part of soy sauce taken and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 about four to five parts at sami co 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 Yes, yes, he could be like you 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 want 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.240
 and then I have to stop relatively small 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.799
 Cut here and just have 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 Something always given to me because of me 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.049
 currently really super super likes like 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 and then just started that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.710
 mix a whole bit 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.850
 if you do that by hand then 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.890
 it can be a bit faster 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 you knead it a bit more easily 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.880
 and then he will be a little bit more 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.890
 softer so if you are the crisp 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.380
 consistency does not like it really is not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 unpleasant so it is very interesting 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.860
 because you like those little ones 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 should i say i can focus on that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 where everything is clear 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.310
 well i love this camera if you like 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.960
 man asks it's the iphone 5 so that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 single small how should you say flowers 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.880
 you simply taste it while chewing and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.270
 I think that's cool 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.000
 result that is actually already 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.210
 everything you have to say so people 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.660
 it often comes racing to try it out 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.330
 from all the best and thumbs up 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.840
