seems to send them back to a prehistoric
state<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:55.860> makes<00:00:56.190> sense<00:00:56.879> i<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.660> um

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
state which makes sense i think but um

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.069

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
just a precautionary measure just so

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.920 
just a precautionary measure just so
they<00:06:50.580> like<00:06:50.670> they<00:06:50.910> have<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.390> trademark<00:06:51.810> in

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
case they want to do it but I don't

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.670 
case they want to do it but I don't
think<00:06:54.000> it<00:06:54.150> necessarily<00:06:54.330> confirms<00:06:55.320> that<00:06:55.470> this

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680
