00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
would have this as a requirement we

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.170 
would have this as a requirement we
deliberately<00:00:35.629> change<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.559> title<00:00:37.180> material

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
deliberately change the title material

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.060 
deliberately change the title material
to<00:00:38.390> materials<00:00:38.809> at<00:00:38.900> equilibrium<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.710> make<00:00:39.890> it

to materials at equilibrium to make it

to materials at equilibrium to make it
something<00:00:41.199> something<00:00:42.199> broader<00:00:42.530> we<00:00:42.860> really

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
something something broader we really

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.619 
something something broader we really
wanted<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.339> each<00:00:43.519> standard<00:00:44.180> classical

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
wanted to each standard classical

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.869 
wanted to each standard classical
thermodynamics<00:00:44.930> which<00:00:45.440> is<00:00:45.589> what<00:00:45.739> we<00:00:45.829> do<00:00:45.979> but

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
thermodynamics which is what we do but

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.880 
thermodynamics which is what we do but
wanted<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.269> broaden<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:47.989> into<00:00:48.229> sort<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.470> modern

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
wanted to broaden it into sort of modern

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.330 
wanted to broaden it into sort of modern
methods<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:50.260> understand<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.500> study<00:00:51.620> the

methods to understand and study the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.319 
methods to understand and study the
energetics<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.910> materials<00:00:53.590> what<00:00:54.590> we<00:00:54.829> do<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.329> we

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
energetics of materials what we do is we

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.479 
energetics of materials what we do is we
essentially<00:00:56.660> teach<00:00:57.350> first<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.190> all<00:00:58.250> we<00:00:58.309> teach

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
essentially teach first of all we teach

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.200

three<00:00:58.820> large<00:00:59.359> segments<00:01:00.489> what<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.609> classical

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
three large segments what is classical

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.079 
three large segments what is classical
thermodynamics<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.530> idea<00:01:03.859> is<00:01:03.949> that

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
thermodynamics and and the idea is that

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.950 
thermodynamics and and the idea is that
people<00:01:05.089> need<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.420> see<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.140> general<00:01:06.410> frame<00:01:07.960> in

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
people need to see the general frame in

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.270 
people need to see the general frame in
which<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.590> can<00:01:09.619> set<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.039> an<00:01:10.160> energy

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
which you can set up an energy

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.219 
which you can set up an energy

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
description for materials how they react

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.050 
description for materials how they react
with<00:01:12.649> their<00:01:12.800> environment<00:01:13.130> how<00:01:13.580> they<00:01:13.729> react

with their environment how they react
with<00:01:14.270> other<00:01:14.420> systems<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.369> wanted<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> teach

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
with other systems so we wanted to teach

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.690 
with other systems so we wanted to teach
them<00:01:17.300> first<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.229> general<00:01:18.710> framework<00:01:19.190> in

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
them first the general framework in

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.359 
them first the general framework in
which<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:20.690> study<00:01:20.989> energetics<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:21.950> materials

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
which to study energetics of materials

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.760 
which to study energetics of materials
and<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:23.660> reason<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:23.929> wanted<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.170> general<00:01:24.649> is

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
and the reason we wanted that general is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.639 
and the reason we wanted that general is
because<00:01:26.200> thermodynamics<00:01:27.200> really<00:01:27.500> has

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
because thermodynamics really has

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.229 
because thermodynamics really has
evolved<00:01:28.190> from<00:01:28.340> being<00:01:29.020> assigns<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:31.239> fixed

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:32.239 
evolved from being assigns with a fixed

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.150 
evolved from being assigns with a fixed
application<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.319> material<00:01:33.679> science<00:01:33.709> that<00:01:34.009> we

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
application in material science that we

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.370 
application in material science that we
have<00:01:34.280> been<00:01:34.429> used<00:01:35.119> for<00:01:35.390> studying<00:01:35.690> metallurgy

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
have been used for studying metallurgy

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.850 
have been used for studying metallurgy
you<00:01:36.739> know<00:01:36.830> making<00:01:37.069> steel<00:01:38.140> refining<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.259> ores

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
you know making steel refining of ores

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.190 
you know making steel refining of ores
and<00:01:40.280> things<00:01:40.580> like<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.789> very<00:01:41.539> standard<00:01:42.080> set

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and things like that very standard set

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600 
and things like that very standard set
of<00:01:42.229> applications<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.340> could<00:01:43.459> almost

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
of applications so that you could almost

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.850 
of applications so that you could almost
teach<00:01:43.910> through<00:01:44.209> the<00:01:44.330> applications<00:01:45.020> now

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
teach through the applications now

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.889 
teach through the applications now
Thurman<00:01:46.250> amex<00:01:46.489> has<00:01:46.580> much<00:01:46.849> more<00:01:46.879> evolved<00:01:47.599> to<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
Thurman amex has much more evolved to a

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.630 
Thurman amex has much more evolved to a
much<00:01:50.899> broader<00:01:51.349> range<00:01:51.709> of<00:01:51.890> applications<00:01:52.489> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
much broader range of applications and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.130 
much broader range of applications and
materials<00:01:53.030> people<00:01:53.270> use<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.599> polymers

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
materials people use it on polymers

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.779 
materials people use it on polymers
people<00:01:54.410> use<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.739> thin<00:01:54.920> films<00:01:55.399> people<00:01:55.700> use

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
people use it on thin films people use

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.710 
people use it on thin films people use
it<00:01:55.910> in<00:01:56.000> biology<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> we<00:01:57.679> felt<00:01:58.509> we<00:01:59.509> couldn't

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
it in biology so we felt we couldn't

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.570 
it in biology so we felt we couldn't
just<00:01:59.840> teach<00:02:00.200> through<00:02:00.530> applications<00:02:01.190> anymore

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
just teach through applications anymore

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.800 
just teach through applications anymore
because<00:02:01.700> there<00:02:01.849> were<00:02:01.910> too<00:02:02.119> many<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.599> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
because there were too many and we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.719 
because there were too many and we
didn't<00:02:03.080> we<00:02:03.470> don't<00:02:03.619> know<00:02:03.979> where<00:02:04.399> it<00:02:04.429> might<00:02:04.700> go

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
didn't we don't know where it might go

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
didn't we don't know where it might go
next<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.140> because<00:02:06.319> I<00:02:06.560> feel<00:02:06.860> really<00:02:07.190> important

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
next so because I feel really important

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.940 
next so because I feel really important
to<00:02:07.700> teach<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.750> generic<00:02:09.229> frameworks<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
to teach the generic frameworks that a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.610 
to teach the generic frameworks that a
student<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.550> go<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.200> whatever

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
student can go with this and whatever

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.400 
student can go with this and whatever
they<00:02:13.190> meet<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.519> their<00:02:13.819> research<00:02:14.150> applied<00:02:14.510> so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
they meet in their research applied so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.949 
they meet in their research applied so
that's<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:16.330> six<00:02:17.330> weeks<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:18.160> lecturing

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
that's about six weeks of lecturing

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.040 
that's about six weeks of lecturing
after<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.110> since<00:02:21.950> thermal<00:02:22.280> amex<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.640> a

after that since thermal amex is a
macroscopic<00:02:24.070> description<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.160> materials<00:02:25.580> we

macroscopic description of materials we

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.470 
macroscopic description of materials we
teach<00:02:26.630> statistical<00:02:27.290> mechanics<00:02:28.210> which<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.360> the

teaches you how to relate microscopic

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.720 
teaches you how to relate microscopic
details<00:02:35.630> atomic<00:02:36.230> level<00:02:36.560> details<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.580> the

details atomic level details to the
thermodynamics<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.170> remember<00:02:39.290> now<00:02:39.500> first

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
thermodynamics so remember now first

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.380 
thermodynamics so remember now first
have<00:02:39.950> seen<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> framework<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:41.210> they

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
have seen the framework and now they

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.650 
have seen the framework and now they
learn<00:02:41.600> how<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:42.340> connect<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:44.210> microscopic

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
learn how to connect it to microscopic

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.690 
learn how to connect it to microscopic
details<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.620> why<00:02:46.160> does<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.400> matter<00:02:46.550> that

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
details you know why does it matter that

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.450 
details you know why does it matter that
this<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.210> titanium<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.080> not<00:02:48.260> aluminum<00:02:48.740> or<00:02:48.890> so

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
this is titanium and not aluminum or so

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.630 
this is titanium and not aluminum or so
so<00:02:50.180> that's<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.510> second<00:02:50.990> piece<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:52.490> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
so that's the second piece and then the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.670 
so that's the second piece and then the
third<00:02:52.880> piece<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.240> essentially<00:02:53.990> taking<00:02:54.500> all

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
third piece is essentially taking all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.460 
third piece is essentially taking all
that<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.160> making<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.180> more<00:02:56.330> applied<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.350> now

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that and making it more applied so now

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860 
that and making it more applied so now
we<00:02:57.530> say<00:02:57.710> we're<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.220> study<00:02:58.690> solutions<00:02:59.690> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
we say we're going to study solutions of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.310 
we say we're going to study solutions of
materials<00:03:00.970> we're<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.300> study<00:03:02.600> thin

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
materials we're going to study thin

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.860 
materials we're going to study thin
films<00:03:03.710> of<00:03:03.860> materials<00:03:04.340> may<00:03:04.760> study<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:05.300> polymer

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
films of materials may study now polymer

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.080 
films of materials may study now polymer
mixture<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.500> those<00:03:07.070> are<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.220> essential<00:03:07.790> three

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
mixture so those are the essential three

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.030 
mixture so those are the essential three
pieces<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.290> there's<00:03:09.500> an<00:03:09.650> enormous

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
pieces and so there's an enormous

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.460 
pieces and so there's an enormous
emphasis<00:03:10.850> on<00:03:11.030> understanding<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.780> concepts

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
emphasis on understanding the concepts

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.390 
emphasis on understanding the concepts
behind<00:03:12.820> what<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:13.970> teach<00:03:14.740> because<00:03:15.740> of<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.190> for

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
behind what we teach because of that for

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.460 
behind what we teach because of that for
example<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.300> not<00:03:17.540> assign<00:03:17.750> homeworks<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.410> a

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
example I I do not assign homeworks on a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.800 
example I I do not assign homeworks on a
weekly<00:03:18.980> basis<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.870> feel<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:23.030> time<00:03:23.420> over

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
weekly basis I feel that the time over

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.750 
weekly basis I feel that the time over
which<00:03:23.930> things<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.710> sink<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.310> longer

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
which things have to sink in is longer

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.050 
which things have to sink in is longer
than<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.970> week<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.360> many<00:03:26.540> cases<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:29.590> we<00:03:30.590> have

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
than a week in many cases so we have

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.110 
than a week in many cases so we have
sets<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.180> assignments<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:34.220> go<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> web

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
sets of assignments that go on the web

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.270 
sets of assignments that go on the web
students<00:03:36.020> do<00:03:36.080> not<00:03:36.230> have<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.530> turn<00:03:36.770> them<00:03:36.950> in<00:03:37.100> a

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
students do not have to turn them in a

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.550 
students do not have to turn them in a
week<00:03:37.970> later<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.510> solutions<00:03:38.990> go<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> web

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
week later the solutions go on the web

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.650 
week later the solutions go on the web
so<00:03:40.220> they<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.490> work<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.150> at<00:03:41.330> their<00:03:41.510> own

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
so they can work on this at their own

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.420 
so they can work on this at their own
pace<00:03:41.930> well<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.560> way<00:03:42.710> we<00:03:42.740> evaluate<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
pace well the way we evaluate the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.450 
pace well the way we evaluate the
students<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.110> very<00:03:45.140> classical<00:03:45.980> sense<00:03:46.220> we

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
students is in a very classical sense we

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.630 
students is in a very classical sense we
have<00:03:46.610> two<00:03:46.760> midterm<00:03:47.120> exams<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:48.050> first<00:03:48.320> one<00:03:48.590> is

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
have two midterm exams the first one is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.970 
have two midterm exams the first one is
purely<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.880> classical<00:03:50.360> thermodynamics<00:03:50.980> so

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
purely on classical thermodynamics so

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.960 
purely on classical thermodynamics so
would<00:03:52.130> be<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.700> first<00:03:52.940> block<00:03:53.480> of<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.970> lecture

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
would be the first block of the lecture

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.990 
would be the first block of the lecture
the<00:03:56.810> course<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.650> there's<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.490> second<00:03:58.850> midterm

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
the course and there's a second midterm

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.490 
the course and there's a second midterm
which<00:03:59.300> largely<00:03:59.600> cover<00:03:59.840> statistical

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
which largely cover statistical

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.750 
which largely cover statistical
mechanics<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.100> some<00:04:01.280> classical

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
mechanics and some classical

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.090 
mechanics and some classical
thermodynamics<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.800> there<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:03.980> a

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
thermodynamics and then there is a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.670 
thermodynamics and then there is a
comprehensive<00:04:04.670> final<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.660> actually<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
comprehensive final and actually the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.010 
comprehensive final and actually the
comprehensive<00:04:07.190> file<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.460> waited<00:04:07.940> for<00:04:08.450> half<00:04:08.840> of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
comprehensive file is waited for half of

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.530 
comprehensive file is waited for half of
the<00:04:09.140> grade<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:09.710> it's<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:10.010> very<00:04:10.220> very<00:04:10.540> extensive

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the grade so it's a very very extensive

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.050 
the grade so it's a very very extensive
waiting<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.140> again<00:04:12.830> that<00:04:13.070> comes<00:04:13.310> back<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.940> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
waiting and again that comes back to the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.450 
waiting and again that comes back to the
idea<00:04:14.330> that<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.570> feel<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.070> know<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.370> a

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
idea that I feel you know this is a

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.900 
idea that I feel you know this is a
difficult<00:04:16.640> subject<00:04:17.290> thermodynamics<00:04:18.290> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
difficult subject thermodynamics and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.390 
difficult subject thermodynamics and
students<00:04:19.910> need<00:04:20.390> sufficient<00:04:20.840> dwell<00:04:21.830> time<00:04:22.190> on

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
students need sufficient dwell time on

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.750 
students need sufficient dwell time on
it<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:23.540> feel<00:04:24.230> that<00:04:24.470> India<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.490> can<00:04:25.670> only

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
it so I feel that India I can only

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.000 
it so I feel that India I can only
really<00:04:26.180> evaluate<00:04:26.840> them<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.290> end<00:04:27.470> whether

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
really evaluate them in the end whether

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.790 
really evaluate them in the end whether
they<00:04:28.220> understand<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.170> if<00:04:30.170> it<00:04:30.350> were<00:04:30.470> up<00:04:30.620> to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
they understand it so if it were up to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.470 
they understand it so if it were up to
me<00:04:30.830> I'd<00:04:31.070> probably<00:04:31.190> put<00:04:31.490> even<00:04:31.700> more<00:04:31.730> emphasis

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
me I'd probably put even more emphasis

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.930 
me I'd probably put even more emphasis
on<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.290> final<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> farmers

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
on the final and so the farmers

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.760 
on the final and so the farmers
comprehensive<00:04:35.570> covers<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.320> whole<00:04:36.350> course

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
comprehensive covers the whole course

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.350 
comprehensive covers the whole course
and<00:04:36.920> also<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> integration<00:04:37.940> between<00:04:37.970> the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and also the integration between the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.760 
and also the integration between the
different<00:04:38.690> sections<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:40.040> treat<00:04:40.430> 320

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
different sections so treat 320

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.420 
different sections so treat 320
energetics<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.860> material

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
energetics of material

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.720 
energetics of material
is<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.940> required<00:04:44.510> course<00:04:44.840> for<00:04:45.310> all<00:04:46.310> our

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
is a required course for all our

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.840 
is a required course for all our
incoming<00:04:47.060> PhD<00:04:47.690> students<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:49.370> they<00:04:49.400> would<00:04:49.640> take

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
incoming PhD students so they would take

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.580 
incoming PhD students so they would take
it<00:04:49.910> typically<00:04:50.480> in<00:04:50.630> their<00:04:50.810> first<00:04:51.050> semester<00:04:51.290> at

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it typically in their first semester at

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.230 
it typically in their first semester at
MIT<00:04:53.290> it<00:04:54.290> is<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.470> recommended<00:04:54.950> course<00:04:55.610> for

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
MIT it is a recommended course for

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.730 
MIT it is a recommended course for
master<00:04:57.050> students<00:04:58.210> masters<00:04:59.210> can<00:04:59.450> also<00:04:59.870> take<00:05:00.320> a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
master students masters can also take a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.580 
master students masters can also take a
shortened<00:05:01.460> version<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.290> but<00:05:03.290> typically

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
shortened version of it but typically

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.170 
shortened version of it but typically
what<00:05:03.800> we<00:05:03.830> see<00:05:03.920> that<00:05:04.160> most<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.760> students<00:05:05.090> in

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
what we see that most of the students in

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.660 
what we see that most of the students in
material<00:05:05.540> science<00:05:05.920> will<00:05:06.920> take<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.370> course

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
material science will take that course

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.940 
material science will take that course
in<00:05:07.820> their<00:05:07.940> first<00:05:08.120> semester<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.800> reason

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
in their first semester and the reason

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.440 
in their first semester and the reason
is<00:05:10.130> taking<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.490> first<00:05:10.670> semester<00:05:10.910> is<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.210> lot<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
is taking the first semester is a lot of

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.510 
is taking the first semester is a lot of
other<00:05:11.570> classes<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.200> build<00:05:12.470> on<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.370> could

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
other classes that build on it you could

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.940 
other classes that build on it you could
see<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.850> course<00:05:14.150> really<00:05:14.360> as<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:15.590> kind<00:05:15.860> of

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
see this course really as the kind of

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.550 
see this course really as the kind of
basic<00:05:16.430> description<00:05:16.910> of<00:05:17.270> how<00:05:18.080> materials

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
basic description of how materials

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.020 
basic description of how materials
evolve<00:05:19.360> what<00:05:20.360> their<00:05:20.540> equilibrium<00:05:20.870> states<00:05:21.440> are

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
evolve what their equilibrium states are

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.480 
evolve what their equilibrium states are
how<00:05:23.030> they<00:05:23.240> interact<00:05:23.660> with<00:05:23.750> their<00:05:23.990> environment

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
how they interact with their environment

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.570 
how they interact with their environment
so<00:05:25.490> other<00:05:26.380> classes<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.470> talk<00:05:27.650> about<00:05:27.890> phase

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
so other classes that talk about phase

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.960 
so other classes that talk about phase
transformations<00:05:29.300> between<00:05:29.360> materials<00:05:30.200> or

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
transformations between materials or

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.610 
transformations between materials or
mechanical<00:05:31.970> behavior<00:05:32.440> relation<00:05:33.440> between

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
mechanical behavior relation between

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.650 
mechanical behavior relation between
mechanical<00:05:33.890> properties<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.880> processing

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
mechanical properties and processing

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.660 
mechanical properties and processing
would<00:05:36.110> all<00:05:36.260> build<00:05:36.560> on<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:36.860> course<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.370> makes

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
would all build on this course it makes

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.000 
would all build on this course it makes
sense<00:05:37.790> that<00:05:38.060> it's<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.630> it's<00:05:38.840> thought<00:05:39.620> early

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
sense that it's that it's thought early

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.110 
sense that it's that it's thought early
so<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.060> course<00:05:41.270> has<00:05:41.510> a<00:05:41.540> thermal<00:05:42.410> help

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
so so the course has a thermal help

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.930 
so so the course has a thermal help
email<00:05:44.120> list<00:05:44.720> which<00:05:45.290> gets<00:05:45.530> logged<00:05:45.830> now<00:05:46.130> that

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
email list which gets logged now that

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.140 
email list which gets logged now that
started<00:05:47.480> we<00:05:47.900> always<00:05:48.140> had<00:05:48.350> a<00:05:48.380> a<00:05:49.000> thermal<00:05:50.000> health

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
started we always had a a thermal health

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150 
started we always had a a thermal health
email<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.810> that<00:05:50.960> those<00:05:51.320> emails<00:05:51.710> would<00:05:51.980> get

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
email and that those emails would get

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.980 
email and that those emails would get
distributed<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.150> staff<00:05:53.420> in<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.750> class

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
distributed to the staff in the class

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.290 
distributed to the staff in the class
and<00:05:54.020> whoever<00:05:54.500> felt<00:05:54.890> they<00:05:55.730> could<00:05:55.880> answer<00:05:56.180> the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
and whoever felt they could answer the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.850 
and whoever felt they could answer the
question<00:05:56.330> would<00:05:56.780> pick<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.140> up<00:05:57.260> and<00:05:57.440> CC

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
question would pick it up and CC

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.830 
question would pick it up and CC
everybody<00:05:58.250> so<00:05:58.400> we<00:05:58.490> knew<00:05:58.610> it<00:05:58.730> was<00:05:58.880> answered<00:05:59.210> and

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
everybody so we knew it was answered and

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.360 
everybody so we knew it was answered and
now<00:05:59.960> we<00:06:00.050> had<00:06:00.140> a<00:06:00.170> creative<00:06:00.410> ta<00:06:00.830> who<00:06:01.040> said<00:06:01.250> you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
now we had a creative ta who said you

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.920 
now we had a creative ta who said you
know<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.700> we<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.330> all<00:06:02.480> these<00:06:02.630> really

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
know it we have all these really

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.900 
know it we have all these really
interesting<00:06:03.470> answers<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:04.160> questions<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:04.730> we

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
interesting answers to questions and we

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.900 
interesting answers to questions and we
really<00:06:05.150> should<00:06:05.470> aggregate<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.740> and<00:06:06.980> so

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
really should aggregate this and so

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.060 
really should aggregate this and so
that's<00:06:08.120> how<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.390> log<00:06:08.780> got<00:06:09.170> started<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:09.890> now

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
that's how the log got started and now

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.580 
that's how the log got started and now
you<00:06:10.430> can<00:06:10.580> actually<00:06:10.880> look<00:06:11.030> online<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:12.290> look<00:06:12.470> at

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
you can actually look online and look at

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.690 
you can actually look online and look at
the<00:06:12.680> questions<00:06:13.130> that<00:06:13.220> we<00:06:13.430> asked<00:06:13.850> other<00:06:14.600> years

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
the questions that we asked other years

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.160 
the questions that we asked other years
the<00:06:16.700> answers<00:06:17.090> that<00:06:17.120> were<00:06:17.330> given<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:18.080> the

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.170 
the answers that were given and the

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.170 
the answers that were given and the
students<00:06:18.410> find<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.620> very<00:06:18.800> useful<00:06:19.090> terminar<00:06:20.090> is

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
students find a very useful terminar is

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.270 
students find a very useful terminar is
a<00:06:20.300> difficult<00:06:20.810> subject<00:06:21.080> it's<00:06:21.980> one<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:24.070> it<00:06:25.070> is

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
a difficult subject it's one that it is

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.870 
a difficult subject it's one that it is
extremely<00:06:25.730> difficult<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.690> learn<00:06:26.960> in<00:06:27.290> one<00:06:27.880> in

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
extremely difficult to learn in one in

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080 
extremely difficult to learn in one in
one<00:06:29.050> setting<00:06:30.050> you<00:06:30.530> know<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:31.430> in<00:06:31.580> one<00:06:31.760> pass

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
one setting you know and in one pass

like<00:06:35.570> taking<00:06:35.900> a<00:06:35.960> course<00:06:36.200> in<00:06:36.380> PowerPoint<00:06:36.950> or

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
like taking a course in PowerPoint or

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.930 
like taking a course in PowerPoint or
something<00:06:37.430> where<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.730> learn<00:06:37.940> facts

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
something where you learn facts

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.850

thermodynamics<00:06:40.940> is<00:06:41.330> more<00:06:41.540> about<00:06:41.860> assembling

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
thermodynamics is more about assembling

the<00:06:43.250> facts<00:06:43.640> in<00:06:43.730> a<00:06:43.790> continuous<00:06:44.270> framework<00:06:44.750> and

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
the facts in a continuous framework and

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.070 
the facts in a continuous framework and
it<00:06:45.410> took<00:06:45.560> me<00:06:45.590> many<00:06:45.860> years<00:06:46.010> to<00:06:46.340> do<00:06:46.580> that<00:06:47.080> so

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
it took me many years to do that so

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.970 
it took me many years to do that so
maybe<00:06:48.260> my<00:06:48.470> advice<00:06:48.800> is<00:06:48.830> to<00:06:50.350> to<00:06:51.350> not<00:06:51.590> give<00:06:51.830> up

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
maybe my advice is to to not give up

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.890 
maybe my advice is to to not give up
it's<00:06:52.220> a<00:06:52.370> tough<00:06:52.580> subject<00:06:52.850> but<00:06:53.240> once<00:06:53.510> it's<00:06:53.750> one

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
it's a tough subject but once it's one

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.720 
it's a tough subject but once it's one
of<00:06:53.990> these<00:06:54.080> subjects<00:06:54.620> that's<00:06:54.770> once<00:06:55.130> you<00:06:55.370> get<00:06:55.580> it

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
of these subjects that's once you get it

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.850 
of these subjects that's once you get it
it<00:06:55.850> you<00:06:56.510> wonder<00:06:56.840> why<00:06:56.960> it<00:06:57.020> was<00:06:57.200> so<00:06:57.380> hard

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
it you wonder why it was so hard
