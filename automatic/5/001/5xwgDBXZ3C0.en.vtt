00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.710
 good evening dear people and sincerely 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.270
 Welcome to another new video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.510
 from me and that is about it today 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 when will my cpu be limited and when will my 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.090
 graphic card 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.279
 because that is so often asked 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.750
 I hope you are everything is her 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.600
 again unbelievably bad light and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 So what I have ten msi 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.449
 afterburner open 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.269
 on my tv here and i play in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.420
 quotes by the way now here like this 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:37.890
 cod should now this game is too 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.530
 No matter resolution is 2k or 1044 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.969
 actually wrong 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.520
 and yes everything looks very nice 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.890
 highest settings et cetera 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.700
 and now show what's up 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 at all the cpu limit or what that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 graphics cards and where do I recognize them 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 what limits because most want yes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.350
 always a super class cpu because she 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.489
 think that it would be better to play 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 now look very short 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.510
 Here I can also show me the fts 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 Let 's do that very briefly 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.130
 attitudes and I believe here 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 advanced 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 create an image 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.729
 I think that was yes that's fps 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.460
 okay there you see it now I have here 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.610
 you can recognize fairly often 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 168 fps wait I'll go for a while 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.930
 then to a game out so now 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.200
 you can read a lot better so 160 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 ps can be said so yes and how do you know 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.110
 I now limited the cpu you are sitting 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 maybe too slow or the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 graphics card and 200 we just look 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.710
 times the msi afterburner over and that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 he has a list with gpu 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.570
 utilization percentage and there is the at 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.960
 890 if I keep it up still need to 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.619
 move the game so between 98 and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.930
 99 is that you can see that is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.969
 the gpu gp us casting is at the maximum 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.619
 actually goes to 100 there that is 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.600
 here the graphics card is completely limited 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.489
 easy and so you can too 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.500
 test within a few seconds 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.330
 just msi afterburner left in the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.310
 install description and look 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.810
 also yours 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.569
 the workload with your settings 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.610
 yes is 90 or sometimes 98 that too 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.560
 depends on it but partly so 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.110
 most of the time he's at 99 himself 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
 which is pretty consistent at 99 and the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.540
 gpu temperature could also see 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
 but it will be below 60 degrees 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.140
 to be a little bit higher I have too 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.209
 a pretty good kohler on it and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.310
 so now again very briefly to 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.430
 statement 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.610
 when does the cpu limit this time? 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.930
 means here is the graphics card on 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.640
 limit and that is actually 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.590
 So far that's what they want 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.989
 most have 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.660
 because if the cpu limited knows then yes 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.950
 not then brings a new one 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.980
 graphics card nothing because the cpu 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.030
 seems so bad is that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.420
 actually only happens if you are now 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.690
 shared a gtx and a pentium 4 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.120
 but processor has indeed limited when 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.349
 a cpu the cpu he prepares the pictures 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.200
 for the video card 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.840
 that is if the cpu so many pictures 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.640
 let's say we have to prepare here 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.640
 play counterstrike 1.6 or something 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.450
 play counter strike 1.6 with his whole 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.130
 old engine and I could say that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.180
 The cpu will limit the best still 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.410
 a resolution of 800 x 600 or something 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.850
 because he really has the graphics card 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.819
 absolutely zero to do 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.950
 especially so close gtx 280 or else 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.480
 something about gtx times has absolutely 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.220
 nothing to do because this resolution can 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.569
 you just pose so without problems 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.920
 only the cpu will limit next to it 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.069
 simply because the cpu then 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.440
 converted about 1000 pictures easy 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.530
 must prepare for the video card and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.930
 this is exactly where the cpu tests will be 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.630
 which cpu performs in games 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.239
 is therefore more performant at low 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.799
 resolutions if just totally many fps 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.840
 have to be prepared 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.720
 and now the other blatant 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.410
 Conversely, if you are really into something 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.509
 plays for itself 2k and 4k resolution 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.039
 now has a fault 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:27.900
 I have video for the moment 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.800
 if in a 4k resolution, crysis 3 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.840
 play with the cryengine then you can 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.370
 quietly have a pentium 4 processor and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.080
 that does not make any difference he still 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.759
 only two or three apps 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.830
 the cdu does not have to do anything anymore 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.870
 prepare because in the 4k resolution at 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.630
 crysis 3 you become with one 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.229
 graphics card just two or three fps 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.509
 to reach 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.680
 as simple as that and there has cdu 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.840
 nothing more to do 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.210
 there is the graphics card at the limit and it 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.800
 does not matter what cdu you have this 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.289
 203 ps can be the oldest cpu for the 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.210
 graphics card that is providing the 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.150
 would be the opposite of others 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.210
 I hope I could just help you 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.349
 for the selection now whether you are now one 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.449
 or which processor I buy 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.720
 should that depend on whether you are 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.310
 ego shooter plays or any 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.960
 Strategy games where many units are on 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.190
 in the field of strategy games, that is 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.270
 with many units and something is there 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.530
 the cpu more important 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.080
 maybe you should do something better too 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.500
 take and in ego-shooter what's up 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.849
 what the cod maybe even new cd 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.419
 normal resolution full hd et 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.330
 cetera, the graphics card is more important and 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.130
 yes there can the cpu so in the case 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.900
 would also be an i3 or something enough 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.740
 as I said there the cebit plays no 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.500
 big role 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.880
 ok then thank you for seeing me 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.800
 one hope you liked it writes 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.159
 Do not forget to rate comments and 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.159
 until the next
