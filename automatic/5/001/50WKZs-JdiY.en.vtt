keep in mind this is on YouTube so the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.349 
keep in mind this is on YouTube so the
video<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.519> compressed<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.150> doesn't

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
video to be compressed and this doesn't

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
video to be compressed and this doesn't
really<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.109> justice<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> still

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
really do it justice like I still

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.679 
really do it justice like I still
rendered<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> uploaded<00:00:30.300> everything<00:00:30.510> in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
rendered and uploaded everything in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
rendered and uploaded everything in
1080p<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.439> color<00:00:31.679> correction<00:00:32.099> or

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
1080p there's no color correction or

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
1080p there's no color correction or
anything<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.450> these<00:00:33.840> are

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
anything like that so you know these are

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
anything like that so you know these are
pretty<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.350> equal<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.309> they're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
pretty much equal but they're going to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
pretty much equal but they're going to
look<00:00:35.850> better<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.690> playing

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
look better when you're actually playing

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.110 
look better when you're actually playing
on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> screen<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.280> yeah<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
on the screen but yeah as you can see I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
on the screen but yeah as you can see I
mean<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.780> next<00:00:40.110> generation<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> game<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
mean the next generation of the game is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.790 
mean the next generation of the game is
just<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.180> much<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.989> vibrant<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just it's so much more vibrant the

just it's so much more vibrant the
colors<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.489> much<00:00:44.700> deeper<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
colors are so much deeper there's so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
colors are so much deeper there's so
much<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.530> diversity<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> colors<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
much more diversity in the colors just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.360 
much more diversity in the colors just
do<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.600> looks<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.860> textures

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
do it it looks a lot better the textures

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.119 
do it it looks a lot better the textures
look<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.120> detailed<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.050> gun<00:00:52.350> itself<00:00:52.739> looks

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
look more detailed the gun itself looks

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
look more detailed the gun itself looks
absolutely<00:00:53.579> head<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> shoulders<00:00:54.510> above<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
absolutely head and shoulders above the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
absolutely head and shoulders above the
previous<00:00:55.590> version<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> gun<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.610> see

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
previous version of the gun you can see

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
previous version of the gun you can see
the<00:00:56.879> light<00:00:57.270> reflecting<00:00:57.300> off<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.440> lot

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the light reflecting off of it a lot

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.990 
the light reflecting off of it a lot
better<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.460> looks<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:00:59.940> more

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
better just it looks a lot more

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
better just it looks a lot more
realistic<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> yeah<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
realistic and yeah I think that's one of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
realistic and yeah I think that's one of
the<00:01:02.550> main<00:01:02.820> differences<00:01:03.120> between<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:04.080> two

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the main differences between these two

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
the main differences between these two
generations<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> games<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.240> lighting

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
generations of games is the lighting

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.480 
generations of games is the lighting
it's<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.860> better<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's just so much better in the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
it's just so much better in the
PlayStation<00:01:09.119> 4<00:01:09.390> version<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
PlayStation 4 version just you know the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.130 
PlayStation 4 version just you know the
sun<00:01:11.430> rays<00:01:11.700> coming<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> bouncing<00:01:13.020> off

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
sun rays coming down and bouncing off

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.929 
sun rays coming down and bouncing off
the<00:01:13.350> snow<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> rocks<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.549> whatever<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the snow or the rocks or whatever it is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
the snow or the rocks or whatever it is
or<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.409> Prison<00:01:16.409> Break<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
know this game was still made with the
old<00:01:26.369> generation<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.210> mind<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> isn't<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
old generation in mind so this isn't the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
old generation in mind so this isn't the
best<00:01:28.470> graphics<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.280> ever<00:01:29.520> possibly<00:01:30.030> get

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
best graphics we can ever possibly get

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
best graphics we can ever possibly get
but<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:30.960> still<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.860> good<00:01:32.009> like

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
but they're still very very good like

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
but they're still very very good like
it's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> huge<00:01:33.000> upgrade<00:01:33.570> over<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.470> previous

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's a huge upgrade over the previous

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.039 
it's a huge upgrade over the previous
generation<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.900> pretty

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
generation and I think that's pretty

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
generation and I think that's pretty
apparent<00:01:37.229> by<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.490> seeing<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> screen

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
apparent by what you're seeing on screen

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.819 
apparent by what you're seeing on screen
again<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.350> didn't<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:40.680> any

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
again you know I don't I didn't put any

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
again you know I don't I didn't put any
color<00:01:41.040> correction<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.640> either<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> these

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
color correction on either one of these

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
color correction on either one of these
but<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> right

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
but as you can see the one on the right

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
but as you can see the one on the right
the<00:01:43.619> ps4<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.250> everything<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.479> much

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the ps4 there everything is just so much

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.420 
the ps4 there everything is just so much
brighter<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.619> much<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:46.920> colored<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
brighter there's so much more colored so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
brighter there's so much more colored so
much<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.729> vibrant<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> grass<00:01:48.780> on

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
much more vibrant look at the grass on

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
much more vibrant look at the grass on
the<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.710> side<00:01:49.979> compared<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> left<00:01:50.670> side

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the right side compared to the left side

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.130 
the right side compared to the left side
you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.479> even<00:01:51.630> close

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
you know it's not even close

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
you know it's not even close
so<00:01:52.290> yeah<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> new<00:01:53.250> version<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> called<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so yeah the new version of called it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
so yeah the new version of called it
goes<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.479> expected<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:55.350> look<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> hell<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
goes as expected does look a hell of a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340 
goes as expected does look a hell of a
lot<00:01:56.490> better<00:01:56.670> than<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> old<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.840> obviously

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
lot better than the old one obviously

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
lot better than the old one obviously
there's<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.890> room<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.219> improvement

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
there's still more room for improvement

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
there's still more room for improvement
we<00:01:59.700> will<00:01:59.880> improve<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.869> coming<00:02:01.140> years

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
we will improve over the coming years

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
we will improve over the coming years
but<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> looks<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
but but it just it looks really good so

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.030 
but but it just it looks really good so
