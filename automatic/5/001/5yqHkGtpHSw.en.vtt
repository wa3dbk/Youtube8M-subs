the<00:01:16.080> case<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> unlike<00:01:17.009> any<00:01:17.220> other<00:01:17.400> biome

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the case is that unlike any other biome

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
the case is that unlike any other biome
in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> game<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.180> unlike<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> jungle<00:01:18.900> which<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
in the game so unlike a jungle which can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
in the game so unlike a jungle which can
border<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.560> any<00:01:19.799> other<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.310> pretty<00:01:20.610> much

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
border with any other but pretty much

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
border with any other but pretty much
anybody<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:21.450> unlike<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> Plains<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
anybody by unlike a Plains which is the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
anybody by unlike a Plains which is the
same<00:01:22.920> thing<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.820> biter<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.390> biome<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
same thing this biter this biome the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
same thing this biter this biome the
mushroom<00:01:25.080> biome<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.470> only<00:01:25.650> border<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.159> one

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
mushroom biome can only border with one

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.980 
mushroom biome can only border with one
other<00:01:26.670> biome<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> game<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
other biome in the game and that is the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
other biome in the game and that is the
ocean<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.740> reason<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
ocean the reason for this is because it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
ocean the reason for this is because it
gives<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> an<00:01:30.630> island<00:01:31.020> effect<00:01:31.110> if

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
gives you kind of an island effect if

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
gives you kind of an island effect if
you<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.650> around<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.130> surrounded<00:01:32.640> by<00:01:32.729> ocean

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you look around it's surrounded by ocean

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
you look around it's surrounded by ocean
you<00:01:33.119> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> mushroom<00:01:33.810> biome<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you look at that mushroom biome it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.539 
you look at that mushroom biome it's
surrounded<00:01:34.619> by<00:01:34.710> ocean<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.400> one

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
surrounded by ocean look at that one

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
surrounded by ocean look at that one
it's<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> exact<00:01:36.299> same<00:01:36.390> thing<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.990> yeah<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's the exact same thing so yeah this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.050 
it's the exact same thing so yeah this
is<00:01:37.680> almost<00:01:38.040> always<00:01:38.280> true<00:01:38.549> every<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:38.970> then

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is almost always true every now and then

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
is almost always true every now and then
you<00:01:39.119> find<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> glitch<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.840> looks<00:01:40.079> like

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you find a glitch where it looks like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.330 
you find a glitch where it looks like
it's<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> true<00:01:40.799> you've<00:01:40.950> no<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.220> totally

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's not true you've no it's totally

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's not true you've no it's totally
true<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.210> basically<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.930> reason<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.439> extra

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
true and basically the reason it's extra

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.219 
true and basically the reason it's extra
rare<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> 360<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.479> ps3<00:01:45.630> sized<00:01:46.049> world

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
rare is because I 360 or ps3 sized world

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
rare is because I 360 or ps3 sized world
it's<00:01:46.380> extra<00:01:46.680> yeah<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.250> small<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> also

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it's extra yeah pretty small and also

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's extra yeah pretty small and also
you<00:01:48.360> combine<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> fact<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> oceans<00:01:49.560> are

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you combine the fact the oceans are

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
you combine the fact the oceans are
deliberately<00:01:50.130> less<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:51.240> rare<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.720> consoles

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
deliberately less very rare on consoles

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
deliberately less very rare on consoles
because<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> limited<00:01:53.520> world<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
because if you have a limited world you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
because if you have a limited world you
don't<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.290> altered

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
don't want up but think so they altered

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.139 
don't want up but think so they altered
the<00:01:55.950> code<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.909> means<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the code like that and it means that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
the code like that and it means that
finding<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> these<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.500> rare

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
finding one of these is actually a rare

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.410 
finding one of these is actually a rare
little<00:01:59.040> treat<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> them

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
little treat and when you do get to them

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
little treat and when you do get to them
you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.020> start<00:02:01.409> question<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.829> oh<00:02:01.979> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you know you start question like oh it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
you know you start question like oh it's
perfect<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:02.670> i<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> first<00:02:03.090> i<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.360> let's<00:02:03.630> go

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
perfect what i do first i think let's go

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
perfect what i do first i think let's go
round<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> let's<00:02:04.500> talk<00:02:04.590> about<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> free<00:02:05.159> big

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
round and let's talk about the free big

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
round and let's talk about the free big
benefits<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.570> mission<00:02:06.840> boom<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.290> first<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
benefits of the mission boom so first I

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
benefits of the mission boom so first I
thought<00:02:08.160> mushrooms<00:02:08.759> these<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.420> amazing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
thought mushrooms these are just amazing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.240 
thought mushrooms these are just amazing
creatures<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.649> probably<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> best

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
creatures they're probably the best

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.059 
creatures they're probably the best
friendly<00:02:11.760> mob<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> game<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.540> that's

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
friendly mob in the game and that's

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.619 
friendly mob in the game and that's
because<00:02:13.219> you<00:02:13.489> know<00:02:13.579> it's<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.819> cow<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
because you know it's a cow but with the

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.059 
because you know it's a cow but with the
extra<00:02:14.870> benefit<00:02:15.230> being<00:02:15.409> up<00:02:15.499> to<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.920> you

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
extra benefit being up to just that you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.860 
extra benefit being up to just that you
know<00:02:16.159> you<00:02:16.670> can't<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.269> can<00:02:17.420> milk<00:02:17.599> them<00:02:17.719> like

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
know you can't you can milk them like

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.179

mushrooms all over the place this is
pretty<00:02:41.810> cool<00:02:41.900> because<00:02:42.290> these<00:02:42.620> don't

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
pretty cool because these don't

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
whole fact that it's purple with my

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.490 
whole fact that it's purple with my
selling<00:02:50.599> on<00:02:50.689> top<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:50.900> you're<00:02:51.019> like<00:02:51.109> oh<00:02:51.230> that's

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
selling on top and you're like oh that's

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.409 
selling on top and you're like oh that's
kind<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.709> cool<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.430> further<00:02:53.000> thought<00:02:53.239> there

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
kind of cool and further thought there

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.970 
kind of cool and further thought there
is<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.659> mycelium<00:02:54.199> around<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.530> place<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:54.889> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is the mycelium around the place so the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.800 
is the mycelium around the place so the
my<00:02:55.099> seldom<00:02:55.430> isn't<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:55.849> causes<00:02:56.239> mobs<00:02:56.449> not<00:02:56.689> to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
my seldom isn't what causes mobs not to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.209 
my seldom isn't what causes mobs not to
spawn<00:02:57.019> around<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.409> but<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.799> is<00:02:57.889> a<00:02:57.919> good

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
spawn around here but it is a good

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.890 
spawn around here but it is a good
indicator<00:02:58.609> of<00:02:58.760> what<00:02:59.000> spawn<00:02:59.299> as<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> mission

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
indicator of what spawn as a mission

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.509 
indicator of what spawn as a mission
biome<00:03:00.139> and<00:03:00.199> what<00:03:00.500> didn't<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:00.949> for<00:03:01.129> instance<00:03:01.159> if

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
biome and what didn't so for instance if

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.099 
biome and what didn't so for instance if
you<00:03:01.790> look<00:03:01.969> on<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.239> island<00:03:02.480> over<00:03:02.719> here<00:03:02.870> this

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
you look on this island over here this

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.449 
you look on this island over here this
is<00:03:03.290> all<00:03:03.439> mission<00:03:03.709> by<00:03:03.859> him<00:03:03.949> so<00:03:04.069> nothing<00:03:04.370> will

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
is all mission by him so nothing will

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.309 
is all mission by him so nothing will
spawn<00:03:04.669> here<00:03:04.849> but<00:03:05.299> over<00:03:05.689> here<00:03:05.870> where<00:03:06.199> it

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
spawn here but over here where it

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.589 
spawn here but over here where it
naturally<00:03:06.590> spawned<00:03:07.189> us<00:03:07.340> across<00:03:07.699> you<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.389> see

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
naturally spawned us across you can see

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.270 
naturally spawned us across you can see
modest<00:03:09.260> would<00:03:09.439> be<00:03:09.560> able<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.739> spawn<00:03:09.919> it<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.219> if

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
modest would be able to spawn it so if

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.979 
modest would be able to spawn it so if
you<00:03:10.370> ever<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.609> issues<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.329> most<00:03:11.599> morning

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
you ever have issues with most morning

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.470 
you ever have issues with most morning
on<00:03:12.139> your<00:03:12.169> rub<00:03:12.790> most<00:03:13.790> funny<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.150> your<00:03:14.269> mushroom

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
on your rub most funny on your mushroom

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.939 
on your rub most funny on your mushroom
island<00:03:14.569> isn't<00:03:15.079> them<00:03:15.319> spawn<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.709> mushroom

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
island isn't them spawn on the mushroom

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.499 
island isn't them spawn on the mushroom
parts<00:03:16.250> them<00:03:16.370> spawning<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> other<00:03:17.000> part<00:03:17.239> so

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:17.509 
parts them spawning on the other part so

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.469 
parts them spawning on the other part so
yeah<00:03:18.049> that's<00:03:18.199> that<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:19.060> basically<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.329> might

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
yeah that's that and basically you might

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.119 
yeah that's that and basically you might
crush<00:03:20.659> them<00:03:20.780> self<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.109> my<00:03:21.290> cell<00:03:21.470> iam<00:03:21.620> doesn't

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
crush them self so my cell iam doesn't

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.800 
crush them self so my cell iam doesn't
stop<00:03:22.370> mob<00:03:22.549> spawning<00:03:22.819> what<00:03:23.329> does<00:03:23.479> it<00:03:23.599> do<00:03:23.780> that

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
stop mob spawning what does it do that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.749 
stop mob spawning what does it do that
because<00:03:24.199> that<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.250> know<00:03:25.340> if<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.489> longest

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:25.759 
because that you know if the longest

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.830 
because that you know if the longest
time<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:26.000> thought<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.509> it's<00:03:26.629> come<00:03:26.810> up

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
time I thought that and it's come up

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.659 
time I thought that and it's come up
common<00:03:27.470> misconception<00:03:28.009> that<00:03:28.129> my<00:03:28.400> cell<00:03:28.579> em

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
common misconception that my cell em

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.550 
common misconception that my cell em
stops<00:03:28.879> mobs<00:03:29.120> from<00:03:29.209> spawning<00:03:29.479> so<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.169> actual

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
stops mobs from spawning so the actual

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.140 
stops mobs from spawning so the actual
thing<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.889> it<00:03:31.009> does<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:31.909> basically

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
thing that it does is that it basically

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.670 
thing that it does is that it basically
is<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.720> way<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.079> place<00:03:33.229> the<00:03:33.379> mushrooms

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
is a way for you to place the mushrooms

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.110 
is a way for you to place the mushrooms
down<00:03:33.859> this<00:03:34.009> is<00:03:34.159> kind<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.430> its<00:03:34.609> only<00:03:34.819> purpose

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
down this is kind of its only purpose

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.089 
down this is kind of its only purpose
besides<00:03:35.449> being<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.079> cool<00:03:36.500> surreal<00:03:36.829> block

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
besides being a cool surreal block

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.949 
besides being a cool surreal block
because<00:03:37.459> right<00:03:38.000> now<00:03:38.030> they<00:03:38.509> change<00:03:38.720> their<00:03:38.840> cup

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
because right now they change their cup

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.509 
because right now they change their cup
of<00:03:39.049> updates<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.349> go<00:03:39.500> on<00:03:39.680> console<00:03:40.099> if<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.370> want

which<00:03:45.500> means<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.889> if<00:03:46.159> you<00:03:46.189> want<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.669> place

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
which means that if you want to place

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.280 
which means that if you want to place
mushrooms<00:03:47.209> down<00:03:47.389> somewhere<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.019> can<00:03:48.169> have

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
mushrooms down somewhere you can have

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.960 
mushrooms down somewhere you can have
put<00:03:48.439> down<00:03:48.620> my<00:03:48.829> cell<00:03:49.040> info<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.459> that's<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.759> cool

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
put down my cell info so that's a cool

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.580 
put down my cell info so that's a cool
benefit<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.449> spine<00:03:50.689> you<00:03:51.049> can<00:03:51.199> still<00:03:51.439> touch

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
benefit of the spine you can still touch

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.379 
benefit of the spine you can still touch
the<00:03:51.650> my<00:03:51.949> cell<00:03:52.159> and<00:03:52.370> take<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.759> with<00:03:52.879> you<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.180> does

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
the my cell and take it with you it does

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.969 
the my cell and take it with you it does
spread<00:03:53.629> like<00:03:53.840> dirt<00:03:54.049> though<00:03:54.229> so<00:03:54.590> watch<00:03:54.769> out

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
spread like dirt though so watch out

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.259 
spread like dirt though so watch out
unless<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.400> want<00:03:55.549> your<00:03:55.639> whole<00:03:55.819> world<00:03:55.969> turn

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
unless you want your whole world turn

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.969 
unless you want your whole world turn
purple<00:03:56.509> but<00:03:56.930> if<00:03:57.169> you<00:03:57.439> do<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.650> your<00:03:57.829> whole

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
purple but if you do want your whole

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.649 
purple but if you do want your whole
world<00:03:58.129> champ<00:03:58.459> purple<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:58.939> you<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.239> totally

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
world champ purple then you can totally

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.969 
world champ purple then you can totally
do<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.840> by<00:04:00.199> getting<00:04:00.259> rid<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.560> grass<00:04:00.769> and

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
do that by getting rid of grass and

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.530 
do that by getting rid of grass and
replace<00:04:01.459> kit<00:04:01.669> with<00:04:01.759> my<00:04:01.879> sin<00:04:02.090> which<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.329> think

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
replace kit with my sin which I think

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.360 
replace kit with my sin which I think
would<00:04:02.599> be<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.780> coolest<00:04:03.379> strangest<00:04:04.069> product

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
would be the coolest strangest product

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.949 
would be the coolest strangest product
but<00:04:04.459> it's<00:04:04.609> it's<00:04:04.969> totally<00:04:05.209> idea<00:04:05.419> but<00:04:05.540> yeah<00:04:05.659> so

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
but it's it's totally idea but yeah so

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.059 
but it's it's totally idea but yeah so
that's<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.229> thing<00:04:06.409> you<00:04:06.530> can<00:04:06.560> do<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:06.949> but

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
that's the thing you can do that but

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.860 
that's the thing you can do that but
let's<00:04:07.219> start<00:04:07.459> talking<00:04:07.639> about<00:04:07.909> how<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.780> know

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
let's start talking about how you know

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.089 
let's start talking about how you know
the<00:04:08.959> whole<00:04:09.079> mob<00:04:09.229> spawning<00:04:09.530> thing<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:09.919> how<00:04:10.039> you

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
the whole mob spawning thing and how you

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.039 
the whole mob spawning thing and how you
can<00:04:10.370> fix<00:04:10.579> up<00:04:10.789> the<00:04:10.909> unsub<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.539> thing<00:04:11.840> about

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
can fix up the unsub the thing about

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.349 
can fix up the unsub the thing about
mushroom<00:04:12.829> ions<00:04:13.039> that<00:04:13.159> makes<00:04:13.430> them<00:04:13.609> so<00:04:13.879> cool<00:04:14.180> if

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
mushroom ions that makes them so cool if

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.999 
mushroom ions that makes them so cool if
you<00:04:14.569> do<00:04:14.750> settle<00:04:15.019> down<00:04:15.259> on<00:04:15.439> them<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.979> fact

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
you do settle down on them is the fact

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.949 
you do settle down on them is the fact
that<00:04:16.250> mobs<00:04:16.579> will<00:04:16.880> not<00:04:17.090> naturally<00:04:17.479> spawn<00:04:17.750> on

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
that mobs will not naturally spawn on

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.050 
that mobs will not naturally spawn on
aim<00:04:18.079> bhushan<00:04:18.500> buyer<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:19.340> because<00:04:19.849> of<00:04:19.969> the

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
aim bhushan buyer and because of the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.459 
aim bhushan buyer and because of the
fact<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.419> mission<00:04:20.690> babe<00:04:20.840> can<00:04:21.079> sometimes

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
fact that a mission babe can sometimes

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.080 
fact that a mission babe can sometimes
expend<00:04:21.799> past<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.250> island<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.849> here<00:04:23.060> for

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
expend past the island like here for

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.640 
expend past the island like here for
instance<00:04:23.240> where<00:04:23.539> this<00:04:23.719> entire<00:04:24.139> area<00:04:24.320> between

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
instance where this entire area between

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.409 
instance where this entire area between
here<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.190> there<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.490> actually<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.090> mission

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
here and there is actually a mission

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:26.860 
here and there is actually a mission
blimey

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
blimey

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.300 
blimey
it's<00:04:27.050> not<00:04:27.139> island<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.710> means<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.100> can<00:04:28.190> have

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
it's not island it means you can have

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.920 
it's not island it means you can have
mattered<00:04:28.760> parts<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.150> maps<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.540> aren't

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
mattered parts the maps that aren't

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.530 
mattered parts the maps that aren't
actually<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:31.400> know<00:04:31.520> affected<00:04:31.940> by<00:04:32.060> mob<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.479> you

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
actually you know affected by mob so you

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.120 
actually you know affected by mob so you
don't<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.960> do<00:04:33.139> with<00:04:33.500> creepers<00:04:33.860> coming

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
don't have to do with creepers coming

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.050 
don't have to do with creepers coming
from<00:04:34.220> blowing<00:04:34.430> your<00:04:34.550> stuff<00:04:34.699> you<00:04:34.790> have<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.000> do

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
from blowing your stuff you have to do

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.550 
from blowing your stuff you have to do
is<00:04:35.180> young<00:04:35.360> bees<00:04:35.479> in<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.870> part<00:04:36.110> format<00:04:36.380> and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
is young bees in that part format and

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.740 
is young bees in that part format and
that's<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.220> think<00:04:37.250> they're<00:04:37.729> big<00:04:38.060> advantage

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
that's I think they're big advantage

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's I think they're big advantage
over<00:04:38.870> any<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.260> mine<00:04:39.440> because<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:39.800> means<00:04:39.949> i<00:04:40.070> can

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
over any of mine because it means i can

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.860 
over any of mine because it means i can
set<00:04:40.490> up<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.820> low<00:04:41.000> base<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.690> middle<00:04:41.840> of

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
set up like a low base in the middle of

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.270 
set up like a low base in the middle of
the<00:04:41.960> ocean<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.380> just<00:04:42.440> not<00:04:42.919> deal<00:04:43.160> with

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
the ocean that and just not deal with

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.800 
the ocean that and just not deal with
anything<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:43.820> i<00:04:44.030> think<00:04:44.419> that's<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.630> cooler

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
anything and i think that's a cooler

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.659 
anything and i think that's a cooler
benefit<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.470> i<00:04:45.650> kind<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.100> counteract<00:04:46.490> this

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
benefit so i kind of counteract this

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.120 
benefit so i kind of counteract this
benefit<00:04:47.120> because<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:48.020> know<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.440> not<00:04:48.710> jet

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
benefit because you know it's not jet

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.189 
benefit because you know it's not jet
you<00:04:49.400> know<00:04:49.490> for<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.120> most<00:04:50.180> part<00:04:50.540> having<00:04:51.110> a

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
you know for the most part having a

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.900 
you know for the most part having a
normal<00:04:51.770> spawning<00:04:52.100> area<00:04:52.340> would<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.699> bit

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
normal spawning area would be a bit

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.000 
normal spawning area would be a bit
broken<00:04:53.150> at<00:04:53.510> almost<00:04:53.960> every<00:04:54.380> single<00:04:54.680> move<00:04:54.800> i'm

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
broken at almost every single move i'm

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.140 
broken at almost every single move i'm
