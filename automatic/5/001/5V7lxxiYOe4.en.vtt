soon as you can see I'm in the middle of

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.709 
soon as you can see I'm in the middle of
both<00:00:40.290> beams<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.010> he's<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.969> getting<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.360> sex

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
both beams and he's not getting any sex

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
both beams and he's not getting any sex
he'll<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.100> damage<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.670> he<00:00:44.700> gets<00:00:44.940> more

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
he'll do more damage when he gets more

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
he'll do more damage when he gets more
stack<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.050> he<00:00:46.170> gets<00:00:46.350> 100<00:00:46.530> sex<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
stack so if he gets 100 sex you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.549 
stack so if he gets 100 sex you
automatically<00:00:47.850> lose<00:00:48.710> as<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.850> doc<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.360> you

switched off and I killed it so it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
switched off and I killed it so it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
wouldn't keep empowering him if you
don't<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.750> any<00:01:00.899> ranged<00:01:01.199> abilities<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.800> the

all<00:01:27.720> pretty<00:01:27.960> easy<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> I'd<00:01:28.950> say<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> one's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
all pretty easy but I I'd say this one's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.780 
all pretty easy but I I'd say this one's
a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:30.030> harder<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a little bit harder this is the one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
a little bit harder this is the one
where<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.210> shark<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> riding<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> rapid<00:01:34.680> ship

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
where the shark is riding the rapid ship

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
where the shark is riding the rapid ship
that's<00:01:35.130> writing<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.200> Velociraptor<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that's writing the Velociraptor and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's writing the Velociraptor and
there's<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.460> three<00:01:38.790> abilities<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
there's really three abilities that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
there's really three abilities that
happen<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.729> red

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
happen here there's gonna be the the red

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.310 
happen here there's gonna be the the red
things<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> spawn<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> ground<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
things that spawn on the ground as you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.289 
things that spawn on the ground as you
can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> spawn<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.030> he's<00:01:45.149> also

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
can see it to spawn and then he's also

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
can see it to spawn and then he's also
gonna<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> laser<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.500> chases<00:01:46.979> after<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
gonna do a laser that chases after you

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
gonna do a laser that chases after you
that<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.729> damage<00:01:48.259> both<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> abilities

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that does damage both of the abilities

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
that does damage both of the abilities
do<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.399> 300k<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
do about 300k so it's not like it's the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
do about 300k so it's not like it's the
info<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.909> hit<00:01:54.060> by<00:01:54.090> them<00:01:54.390> but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
info if you get hit by them but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
info if you get hit by them but
obviously<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.409> hit<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.920> by<00:01:56.399> them

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
obviously if you get hit by more by them

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
obviously if you get hit by more by them
more<00:01:56.729> than<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.360> twice<00:01:58.189> you're

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
more than like once or twice you're

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.609 
more than like once or twice you're
probably<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.670> die<00:02:00.020> he<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:01.140> does<00:02:01.409> blue

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
probably gonna die he also does blue

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
probably gonna die he also does blue
crush<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.219> soon<00:02:02.430> either<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:02.909> was

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
crush as soon either side was

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.980 
crush as soon either side was
interrupted<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> there

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
interrupted it there

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.499 
interrupted it there
he<00:02:04.290> did<00:02:04.500> he<00:02:04.619> did<00:02:04.649> cast<00:02:05.040> blue<00:02:05.250> crush<00:02:05.579> every<00:02:06.299> time

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
he did he did cast blue crush every time

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
he did he did cast blue crush every time
he<00:02:06.659> finishes<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> disruptive<00:02:07.770> laser<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.250> after

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
he finishes a disruptive laser and after

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639 
he finishes a disruptive laser and after
he<00:02:08.550> does<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> he<00:02:09.840> basically<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.200> Meli's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
he does that he basically just Meli's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.170 
he does that he basically just Meli's
you<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.129> gives<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> time<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.879> reposition

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you so this gives you time to reposition

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.220 
you so this gives you time to reposition
them<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
them and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.960 
them and
so<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.650> focus<00:02:13.739> on<00:02:14.040> doing<00:02:14.340> damage<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so just focus on doing damage and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.449 
so just focus on doing damage and
avoiding<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.440> red<00:02:16.620> circles<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.250> see

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
avoiding the the red circles you can see

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.580 
avoiding the the red circles you can see
puts<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.849> down<00:02:17.879> again<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.379> rinse

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
puts it down again and it's just rinse

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.750 
puts it down again and it's just rinse
and<00:02:19.709> repeat<00:02:20.099> there<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.580> need<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and repeat there you just need to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.280 
and repeat there you just need to
remember<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.000> interrupt<00:02:21.510> Blue<00:02:21.750> Crush<00:02:22.049> because

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
remember to interrupt Blue Crush because

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
remember to interrupt Blue Crush because
if<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.470> don't<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.830> does<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.129> 400,000<00:02:23.879> damage

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
if you don't it does like 400,000 damage

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
if you don't it does like 400,000 damage
and<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.450> knocks<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.950> you're<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.159> dead

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and it knocks you back you're just dead

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.360 
and it knocks you back you're just dead
basically<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.659> gets<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:28.129> this<00:02:29.129> next

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
basically if if it gets off this next

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.820 
basically if if it gets off this next
fight<00:02:29.610> here<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.120> disrupt<00:02:30.840> Ron<00:02:31.049> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
fight here is disrupt Ron this is the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.309 
fight here is disrupt Ron this is the
hard<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.280> okay<00:02:32.840> basically<00:02:33.840> he's<00:02:34.200> gonna

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
hard one okay basically he's gonna

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.839 
hard one okay basically he's gonna
empower<00:02:34.709> different<00:02:35.129> turrets<00:02:35.310> around<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
empower different turrets around the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.699 
empower different turrets around the
room<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.330> there's<00:02:36.900> these<00:02:37.080> red<00:02:37.319> things<00:02:37.560> that

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
room and there's these red things that

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.569 
room and there's these red things that
you<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.730> I'm<00:02:38.849> jumping<00:02:39.120> over<00:02:39.540> here

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
you can see that I'm jumping over here

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.920 
you can see that I'm jumping over here
heat<00:02:41.579> whenever<00:02:41.879> he<00:02:42.000> empowers<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> turret<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
heat whenever he empowers a turret it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.380 
heat whenever he empowers a turret it
shoots<00:02:43.170> out<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:44.370> bursts<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.819> those<00:02:45.030> three

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
shoots out little bursts of those three

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.500 
shoots out little bursts of those three
things<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.470> he's<00:02:46.620> casting<00:02:47.010> sonic<00:02:47.400> blasts<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
things and he's casting sonic blasts and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
things and he's casting sonic blasts and
what<00:02:48.660> sonic<00:02:48.959> blast<00:02:49.200> does<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.769> an<00:02:49.890> AoE

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
what sonic blast does is it's an AoE

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
what sonic blast does is it's an AoE
around<00:02:50.610> them<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.910> stuns<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.200> human

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
around them that stuns you you can human

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.990 
around them that stuns you you can human
drink<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.549> don't<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
drink it out of it and I don't think it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.300 
drink it out of it and I don't think it
does<00:02:54.120> any<00:02:54.329> damage<00:02:54.359> it's<00:02:55.349> very<00:02:55.650> annoying<00:02:55.980> like

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
does any damage it's very annoying like

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.890 
does any damage it's very annoying like
right<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.640> as<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.879> see<00:02:56.940> he<00:02:57.390> empowered

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
right now as you can see he empowered

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.130 
right now as you can see he empowered
the<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.980> middle<00:02:59.310> one<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.959> actually

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the the middle one and so that actually

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.610 
the the middle one and so that actually
makes<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.099> lot<00:03:02.250> harder<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.269> at<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.629> think<00:03:04.290> 20

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
makes it a lot harder but at I think 20

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.580 
makes it a lot harder but at I think 20
or<00:03:04.829> 25%<00:03:05.549> he<00:03:06.540> does<00:03:06.720> an<00:03:06.870> ability<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.410> where

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
or 25% he does an ability to where

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.860 
or 25% he does an ability to where
basically<00:03:08.040> he<00:03:08.760> empowers<00:03:09.750> all<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.200> his<00:03:11.870> what's

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
basically he empowers all of his what's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.259 
basically he empowers all of his what's
a<00:03:12.930> goal<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:14.190> his<00:03:14.340> turrets<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.849> everything

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
a goal all of his turrets and everything

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.569 
a goal all of his turrets and everything
and<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.629> 23<00:03:16.049> seconds<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.620> kill<00:03:16.769> them<00:03:16.980> so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
and you have 23 seconds to kill them so

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.550 
and you have 23 seconds to kill them so
at<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.910> point<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.419> have<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> you're<00:03:19.319> kind<00:03:19.500> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
at that point you have a you're kind of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.659 
at that point you have a you're kind of
on<00:03:19.709> an<00:03:19.829> enrage<00:03:20.160> timer<00:03:21.109> Zhen<00:03:22.109> Shan<00:03:22.470> Zhen<00:03:23.370> char

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
on an enrage timer Zhen Shan Zhen char

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.150 
on an enrage timer Zhen Shan Zhen char
is<00:03:24.000> not<00:03:24.599> really<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.959> hard<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.500> fight<00:03:25.739> as

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
is not really that hard of a fight as

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.099 
is not really that hard of a fight as
you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.669> I<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.269> wee<00:03:27.510> down<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
you can see I just a wee down all the

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.080 
you can see I just a wee down all the
eyes<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.769> second<00:03:29.220> that's<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> first<00:03:29.849> part

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
eyes in one second that's the first part

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.699 
eyes in one second that's the first part
of<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> fight<00:03:30.419> is<00:03:30.569> used<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.049> AoE<00:03:31.290> down<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
of the fight is used to the AoE down the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.740 
of the fight is used to the AoE down the
eyes<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.880> starts<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> real<00:03:33.480> fight

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
eyes and then that starts the real fight

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.569 
eyes and then that starts the real fight
which<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.380> basically<00:03:34.829> killing<00:03:35.130> him<00:03:35.370> while

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
which is basically killing him while

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.250 
which is basically killing him while
avoiding<00:03:35.849> these<00:03:36.180> green<00:03:36.480> beams<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.079> green

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
avoiding these green beams the green

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.020 
avoiding these green beams the green
beams<00:03:37.500> hit<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.859> for<00:03:38.040> 300<00:03:38.430> K<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.760> as<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.910> can

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
beams hit you for 300 K and as you can

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.759 
beams hit you for 300 K and as you can
see<00:03:39.239> I'm<00:03:39.359> just<00:03:39.419> kind<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> showing<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.620> guys

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
see I'm just kind of showing you guys

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.740 
see I'm just kind of showing you guys
kind<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.310> out<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.730> way<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.090> they<00:03:42.209> behave<00:03:42.389> and

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
kind of out the way that they behave and

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.270 
kind of out the way that they behave and
he<00:03:42.810> also<00:03:42.930> does<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.260> eye<00:03:43.290> gaze<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.069> can't

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
he also does the eye gaze so you can't

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.180 
he also does the eye gaze so you can't
just<00:03:44.489> stand<00:03:44.639> in<00:03:44.849> one<00:03:45.000> spot<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.690> think<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.829> get<00:03:47.010> hit

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
just stand in one spot I think I get hit

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.470 
just stand in one spot I think I get hit
once<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.579> twice<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.569> end<00:03:50.480> as

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
once or twice like right at the end as

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.000 
once or twice like right at the end as
you<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.959> like<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:52.709> that's<00:03:52.889> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
you can see like I think that's the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.400 
you can see like I think that's the
second<00:03:53.340> time<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.700> get<00:03:53.760> hit<00:03:54.230> they<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
second time that I get hit they have a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.259 
second time that I get hit they have a
pretty<00:03:55.919> big<00:03:56.160> range<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.790> they<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.030> hit<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
pretty big range that they can hit you

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.849 
pretty big range that they can hit you
