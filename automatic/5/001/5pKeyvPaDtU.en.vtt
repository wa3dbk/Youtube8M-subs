00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.650
 what a wave band that suffers I do not 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.540
 commenting if we are in a new video 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.970
 tutorial on how to build an elevator 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.420
 without good water what we have to do 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.369
 they are a 5 cube high tower and in 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.310
 the fifth how to do as a kind of 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.010
 structures in this way we have to 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.160
 let's say surround it and put a bucket of more 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.910
 because what we're leaving a cube in 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.949
 the center without placing this way and there 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 that remove this very well then well 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.390
 we have to put a ladder under 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.460
 good that I think you have to put it on 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.430
 this way after up there you have to 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 put a bucket with a rail and up 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.460
 dominica then remove this cube and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.590
 then the mini fall is going to fall there what 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.140
 that will help us to the elevator after 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.390
 count from the platform five cubes and 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.870
 let's go we already have two three four and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.750
 five and they repeat a process you have to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.210
 build the same structure and everything and 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.570
 now we will give the second structure 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.970
 that will be like a stop you can say 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.670
 you have to finish this and you have to repeat what 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 same as putting the ladder in the cub 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 here he puts the king later with mime 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.869
 rival very well and we will have to remove the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.080
 cube there it is and now you have to do it 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.320
 count from the platform five cubes and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.420
 we take two three four and five and here 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 that's when we're going to do the platform 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.140
 and we have this structure that puts 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.050
 let's say two more cubes this way 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.390
 and then we all fill in the same 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.600
 three cubes wide and we are seeing 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.149
 as we already finished the structure and 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.950
 now that they repeat a process they propose 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.670
 the whites below propose to fill 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.259
 these spaces like this and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.780
 then you have to repeat the same 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.979
 process put up and then mimic 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.170
 up and ready now that he was a christ and 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.149
 now we have to test if it works we have 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.700
 to give when in castles that 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.280
 mini that after prison he again you 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.660
 you go down and you go down in 3 wii and it's that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.450
 press it but d 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.050
 pressed to be able to climb and already you 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.670
 low and you can already be on the platform 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 that way you can go up and down 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.480
 easy way without using water and this 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.180
 it was the elevator is a very easy way 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.160
 but it is without water also with that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 I will go saying goodbye, do not forget the line 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.960
 like in tennis for more videos of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.960
 next results videos see you
