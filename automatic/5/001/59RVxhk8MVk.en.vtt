because we've had high chairs in the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.580 
because we've had high chairs in the
past<00:01:24.760> where<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.119> did<00:01:25.450> not<00:01:25.479> have<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> tray<00:01:26.320> liner

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
past where you did not have a tray liner

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.440 
past where you did not have a tray liner
and<00:01:26.860> cleaning<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.490> was<00:01:27.670> really<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> nightmare

this
actually<00:01:59.910> attached<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.720> highchair

apart to slide the straight on so that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
because our last high chair was cloth

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.560 
because our last high chair was cloth
and<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:53.040> was<00:03:53.160> very<00:03:53.400> difficult<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.209> clean

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
and it was very difficult to get clean

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.960 
and it was very difficult to get clean
and<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.110> stained<00:03:55.410> all<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.709> time<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.489> this

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
and it was stained all the time so this

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.150 
and it was stained all the time so this
material<00:03:57.450> actually<00:03:57.810> wipes<00:03:58.290> clean<00:03:58.709> very

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
material actually wipes clean very

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.930 
material actually wipes clean very
easily

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
easily

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.300 
easily
another<00:04:00.630> great<00:04:00.900> feature<00:04:00.960> of<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.680> gusto<00:04:02.100> is

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
another great feature of the gusto is

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.030 
another great feature of the gusto is
that<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.640> actually<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:03.150> height<00:04:03.480> adjustable<00:04:04.040> so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that it actually is height adjustable so

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.160 
that it actually is height adjustable so
you<00:04:05.070> can<00:04:05.520> there's<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.180> button<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.600> each<00:04:06.780> side<00:04:07.140> of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you can there's a button on each side of

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.900 
you can there's a button on each side of
the<00:04:07.350> frame<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> might<00:04:08.310> be<00:04:08.400> easier<00:04:08.760> with

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
the frame and it might be easier with

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.220 
the frame and it might be easier with
the<00:04:09.000> tray<00:04:09.210> off<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.690> I'll<00:04:09.780> leave<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.170> for

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the tray off but I'll leave it on for

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.370 
the tray off but I'll leave it on for
now<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:11.400> squeeze<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:12.000> and

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
now is you just squeeze this and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.930 
now is you just squeeze this and
actually<00:04:13.380> slice<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.070> four<00:04:14.340> different<00:04:14.760> heights

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
actually slice to four different heights

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.420 
actually slice to four different heights
this<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.540> lowest<00:04:15.930> setting<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.709> then<00:04:17.340> you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
this is the lowest setting and then you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.550 
this is the lowest setting and then you
just<00:04:17.610> pull<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.360> it<00:04:18.900> comes<00:04:19.140> right<00:04:19.290> up

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
just pull on it and it comes right up

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280 
just pull on it and it comes right up
you<00:04:19.680> hear<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:19.890> click<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:21.660> again<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.170> the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
you hear a click so again this is the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.520 
you hear a click so again this is the
lowest<00:04:22.500> setting

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.430 

so<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.130> can<00:04:26.310> see<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.760> child<00:04:27.180> needs<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.750> be<00:04:27.900> at

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
so you can see if a child needs to be at

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.310 
so you can see if a child needs to be at
a<00:04:28.500> lower<00:04:28.740> table<00:04:29.220> without<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.880> tray<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:31.200> can

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
a lower table without the tray you can

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.360 
a lower table without the tray you can
adjust<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.980> for<00:04:32.160> whatever<00:04:32.370> height<00:04:32.760> they<00:04:33.000> need

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
adjust it for whatever height they need

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.760 
adjust it for whatever height they need
this<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.880> second<00:04:36.570> setting<00:04:38.060> third<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.770> all

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
this is the second setting third and all

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.370 
this is the second setting third and all
the<00:04:40.950> way<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.330> adjust<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> any

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the way up so you can adjust this to any

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.410 
the way up so you can adjust this to any
height<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.710> might<00:04:44.070> need<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.940> push<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
height you might need to push the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.240 
height you might need to push the
highchair<00:04:45.930> up<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.230> table<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.890> prefer

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
highchair up to a table if you prefer

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.460 
highchair up to a table if you prefer
using<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.730> without<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.210> tray<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.260> there<00:04:49.410> are

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
using it without the tray so there are

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.050 
using it without the tray so there are
many<00:04:49.680> great<00:04:49.860> features<00:04:50.280> about<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.670> gusto<00:04:51.030> that

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
many great features about the gusto that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.940 
many great features about the gusto that
I<00:04:51.210> really<00:04:51.540> like<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.320> course<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.650> love<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.790 
I really like and of course I love the
color<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> chose<00:04:54.270> this<00:04:54.570> purple<00:04:54.960> color<00:04:54.990> I

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
color so I chose this purple color I

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.860 
color so I chose this purple color I
believe<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:56.580> called<00:04:56.700> something<00:04:57.180> else<00:04:57.300> on

believe it's called something else on
their<00:04:58.230> website<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.100> because<00:04:59.880> we<00:05:00.150> have<00:05:00.300> a
