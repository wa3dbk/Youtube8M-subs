do<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.550> made<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.330> hair<00:02:12.569> feel<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
do think that it made my hair feel a lot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.940 
do think that it made my hair feel a lot
softer<00:02:13.560> um<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:15.060> felt<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.750> instantly<00:02:16.410> softer

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
