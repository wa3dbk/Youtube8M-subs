00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I think we just lack leadership as a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.740 
I think we just lack leadership as a
whole<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.950> defense<00:00:50.430> last<00:00:50.670> year<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.270> am

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
whole in defense last year and that's am

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I in my opinion that's where the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
I in my opinion that's where the
linebacker<00:00:53.640> does<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> foremost

just got to get him to continual in that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.740 
just got to get him to continual in that
same<00:02:30.680> path<00:02:30.890> how<00:02:31.280> much<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.540> guess<00:02:32.570> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
same path how much of it was I guess a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.420 
same path how much of it was I guess a
challenge<00:02:33.320> with<00:02:33.500> him<00:02:33.680> when<00:02:33.890> he's<00:02:34.010> got<00:02:34.250> in

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
challenge with him when he's got in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.360 
challenge with him when he's got in
there<00:02:34.670> early<00:02:35.210> as<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> freshman<00:02:35.900> last<00:02:35.930> year<00:02:36.370> well

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
there early as a freshman last year well

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.250 
there early as a freshman last year well
part<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> challenge<00:02:38.300> was<00:02:38.600> he<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.050> wasn't

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
part of the challenge was he just wasn't

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.860 
part of the challenge was he just wasn't
as<00:02:39.440> plain<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:39.680> much<00:02:40.370> as<00:02:40.550> Barry<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.210> when<00:02:41.420> it

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
as plain as much as Barry so when it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.270 
as plain as much as Barry so when it
came<00:02:42.020> time<00:02:42.260> he<00:02:42.440> was<00:02:42.560> playing<00:02:42.710> more<00:02:42.920> toward<00:02:43.190> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
came time he was playing more toward the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.560 
came time he was playing more toward the
end<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.490> season<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:43.910> when<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.120> came<00:02:44.270> time<00:02:44.510> to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
end of season but when it came time to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.050 
end of season but when it came time to
actually<00:02:44.960> step<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.740> there<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.580> bowl<00:02:46.820> game

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
actually step in there in the bowl game

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.520 
actually step in there in the bowl game
I<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.450> don't<00:02:47.600> think<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:48.020> something<00:02:48.200> that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
I just don't think it's something that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.970 
I just don't think it's something that
he<00:02:48.890> embraced<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:49.580> was<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:51.110> know<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.800> was<00:02:51.860> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
he embraced and it was you know it was a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.190 
he embraced and it was you know it was a
disaster<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.750> opening<00:02:54.050> kickoff

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
disaster from from the opening kickoff

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
disaster from from the opening kickoff
in<00:02:54.560> bogan<00:02:54.950> nothing<00:02:55.280> went<00:02:55.459> right<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.180> so

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
in bogan nothing went right you know so

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.300 
in bogan nothing went right you know so
I<00:02:56.420> think<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:57.230> most<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.620> our<00:02:57.739> guys<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
I think like most of our guys they you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.220 
I think like most of our guys they you
know<00:02:58.459> they<00:02:58.820> were<00:02:59.180> questioning<00:02:59.690> themselves<00:02:59.810> in

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
know they were questioning themselves in

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.650 
know they were questioning themselves in
the<00:03:00.290> locker<00:03:00.500> room<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.300> was<00:03:02.420> just<00:03:02.510> a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the locker room and I just it was just a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.210 
the locker room and I just it was just a
matter<00:03:02.810> going<00:03:03.110> out<00:03:03.320> getting<00:03:03.500> stopped<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.190> I

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
matter going out getting stopped and I

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.949 
matter going out getting stopped and I
think<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.550> started<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> see<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.360> confidence

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
think you started to see the confidence

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.229 
think you started to see the confidence
start<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.350> come<00:03:06.590> back<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> little<00:03:07.010> bit<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.459> it

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
start to come back a little bit so it

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.920 
start to come back a little bit so it
was<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:09.110> was<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> playing<00:03:10.040> time<00:03:10.280> issue

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
