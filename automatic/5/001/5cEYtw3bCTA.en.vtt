okay<00:00:01.500> what<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:02.010> have<00:00:02.040> here<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.939> beef<00:00:03.270> brisket

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay what we have here is a beef brisket

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay what we have here is a beef brisket
Packer<00:00:04.319> cut<00:00:04.740> as<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.460> can<00:00:05.700> see<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> grid<00:00:06.240> here

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
Packer cut as you can see the grid here

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.310 
Packer cut as you can see the grid here
says<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:06.950> USDA<00:00:07.950> choice<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.760> basically<00:00:09.719> you

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
says it's USDA choice and basically you

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.839 
says it's USDA choice and basically you
probably<00:00:10.740> know<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.250> person<00:00:11.759> could

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
probably know that a person could

probably know that a person could
consists<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.630> two<00:00:12.960> different<00:00:13.380> types<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> meat

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
consists of two different types of meat

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.390 
consists of two different types of meat
connected<00:00:15.120> by<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> layer<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.289> fat<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.130> this

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
connected by a layer of fat here so this

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.689 
connected by a layer of fat here so this
bottom<00:00:18.150> half<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> called<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
bottom half right here is called the

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.570 
bottom half right here is called the
flat<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.750> upper<00:00:22.140> half<00:00:22.320> right<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:23.160> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
flat and this upper half right here is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 
flat and this upper half right here is
called<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> point<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.840> reason<00:00:25.560> they're

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
called the point and reason they're

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
called the point and reason they're
different<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.570> fact

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
different is because you can the fact

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.980 
different is because you can the fact
grain<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.939> meat<00:00:29.939> goes<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.900> different

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
grain of meat goes in different

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.569 
grain of meat goes in different
directions<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.769> both<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> flat<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
directions in both the flat and the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.630 
directions in both the flat and the
point<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:33.570> also<00:00:33.780> certain<00:00:34.280> talk<00:00:35.280> about

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
point there's also certain talk about

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.740 
point there's also certain talk about
how<00:00:36.230> different<00:00:37.230> size<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.219> animal<00:00:38.750> whether

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
how different size of the animal whether

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530 
how different size of the animal whether
it's<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> left-sided<00:00:40.910> point<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.090> right-sided

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it's a left-sided point or right-sided

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's a left-sided point or right-sided
point<00:00:43.460> has<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> different<00:00:45.000> texture<00:00:45.360> or

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
point has a different texture or

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
point has a different texture or
different<00:00:46.050> softness<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.920> tenderness<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.969> they

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
different softness or tenderness so they

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
different softness or tenderness so they
say<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> left-sided<00:00:48.930> brisket<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> have

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
say the left-sided brisket if you have

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.910 
say the left-sided brisket if you have
the<00:00:49.950> fat<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:50.789> down<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.660> fine<00:00:51.930> curves<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the fat side down the fine curves to the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240 
the fat side down the fine curves to the
right<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.070> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
right I don't know if that really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
right I don't know if that really
matters<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.680> here

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770

my favorite barbecue brisket is in hill
country<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.490> recipe<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.119> could

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
country and the recipe that I could

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
country and the recipe that I could
defined<00:01:30.780> online<00:01:31.290> calls<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> simple<00:01:32.369> rub<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
defined online calls for a simple rub of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.560 
defined online calls for a simple rub of
just<00:01:33.600> kosher<00:01:34.110> salt<00:01:34.439> some<00:01:35.159> black<00:01:35.400> pepper<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
just kosher salt some black pepper and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
just kosher salt some black pepper and
cayenne<00:01:37.380> pepper<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.549> basically<00:01:39.360> we're<00:01:39.630> just

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
cayenne pepper so basically we're just

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
cayenne pepper so basically we're just
gonna<00:01:40.020> rub<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> into<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:41.369> sides<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
gonna rub that into all sides of the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.410 
gonna rub that into all sides of the
untrimmed<00:01:42.600> whisk<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.560> try<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.210> smoke<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
untrimmed whisk that and try to smoke it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
untrimmed whisk that and try to smoke it
and<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> reach<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.860> internal

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and have it reach an internal

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.020 
and have it reach an internal
temperature<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.850> 180<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.630> 190<00:01:48.780> degrees

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
temperature of about 180 to 190 degrees

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.400 
temperature of about 180 to 190 degrees
here<00:01:52.030> we<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> brisket<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.230> about

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
here we have the brisket just about

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.350 
here we have the brisket just about
ready<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.860> go<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:55.900> our<00:01:56.490> smoking<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.730> model<00:01:58.180> one

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
ready to go in our smoking it model one

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.690 
ready to go in our smoking it model one
electric<00:01:58.780> smoker<00:01:59.080> as<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.190> know<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.670> a

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
electric smoker as you know this is a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.640 
electric smoker as you know this is a
thermometer<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.960> we're<00:02:02.230> just<00:02:02.470> going<00:02:02.620> to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
thermometer and we're just going to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.320 
thermometer and we're just going to
monitor<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.250> but<00:02:03.430> it's<00:02:03.550> probably<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
monitor that but it's probably going to
