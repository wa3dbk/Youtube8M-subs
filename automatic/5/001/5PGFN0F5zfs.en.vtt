00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.750
 we are in summer and I will continue 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.029
 with a training pruning in this case 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.369
 a green pruning of the cherry tree to achieve 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.830
 a good disposition of its branches to the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.490
 time to fructify and also at the time 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.170
 to improve the health status of the tree 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.110
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 eliminate these pacifiers that have a 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.420
 vertical layout and what they are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.350
 doing is taking sap from the tree 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.989
 and prevent them from forming 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.059
 fruitful buds that will give origin 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.620
 to the fruit that is what we want with 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 this crop 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.810
 we are removing all the branches of 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.160
 hospitals will be the first thing we do 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.530
 we do not cut them just by the base 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 we leave two or three centimeters so that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.050
 the buds that are in that place 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.080
 develop and give rise to a new 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.450
 cherry floor 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.780
 we will also remove the branches that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.299
 they go through and they go towards the center 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.450
 for the same reason because they are removing 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.580
 a good disposition to the tree in its 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.340
 branches and prevent the branches is formed 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.200
 according to what we are looking for good 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.020
 we have already eliminated the branches 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.390
 vertical suckers and now the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.130
 that we get and that they have good 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.820
 lateral orientation let's take it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.430
 approximately from the point of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.710
 exemption may be this the point of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.950
 Insertion of the previous year's branch is 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.860
 approximately around here 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 it practically reaches 90 or 100 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.310
 centimeters and we're going to leave it around 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.640
 of 50 about half 40 or 50 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.320
 centimeters always trying to cut 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.920
 above a flame that has a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.100
 good location to give rise to new 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.540
 branches inside that floor 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.540
 more or less we will leave like this 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.959
 we are breaking the branches 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.959
 to give rise to a new floor 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.440
 and the training is more correct this 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 branch that is here although it is 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.489
 it's going down we're not going to touch it for 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.349
 so that the year that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.829
 it comes that surely will be loaded 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.700
 of flowers because more or less we have the 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.700
 work done 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 we have finished the work as 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.599
 you can see it is very simple and easy 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
 to perform with some knowledge 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.580
 basic we will be giving the form to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.500
 skeleton as we wish for 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.750
 our fruit and that in this way 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.970
 more productive in the future I hope that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
 with this video with the previous ones it is not 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.579
 easier to carry out these 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.129
 training operations for your 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.900
 fruit trees in this case cherry a 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.900
 greeting and until the next video
