00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.840
 ah ah ah ah the law galera beauty acfor 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.430
 joãozinho one more video for the channel 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.310
 would know if the person is a video 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.740
 talking about fifa 16 is some 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.420
 news that came out is actually two 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 in specific that you have already seen in the title 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 It's been a while, it's been a while but the other one. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.780
 Hoping I was expecting some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 thing to talk about at the same time 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.910
 talk about two things in the same video 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 first in the staff is fifa to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.199
 INEP released another one little video 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.180
 television on for 16 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.770
 and this time it is not different from the others and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 not have to let me let me excited 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.149
 Because I really liked this one. 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 That they said they will do it in the trailer. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 says that they have shown that we show a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 in the three that I showed 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 previously that a gentleman who 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 previously released but now 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.270
 focused more on it then gave 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.879
 realize that something is going to be going well 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 It's cool, I stole it from training screen and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.750
 I'll talk while you go. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 watching, but it's basically this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.610
 tape and nine in the gameplay a novelty in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.610
 gameplay 2016 is fired 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.400
 this is the system you do not like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 and to give the ball dribbling as not dribble 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 name right then it's something really cool to what 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.350
 focused on mexico by doing this in that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.960
 English essay here before 13 in the look of 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.420
 e3 but now it 's a full video about 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 that with messi interview is with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 several players doing this if that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 dribble and I say you will not be able 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.030
 or will not use just to dribble and want 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 Are you going to use this for an accident? 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 cheating and takes a step like 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 several times it is shown in the video there 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 Face, but it's very nice of face. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 Thanks. I really liked it. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.000
 in this new fitna gameplay of 16 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.960
 waiting a lot to see how it goes 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 work, this will work 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.430
 properly so smart guy teaches there 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 It's cool that it's cool one of the few 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 things that came out so far that I 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.460
 really left happy with son 16 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.350
 face something that will also be for 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.439
 to increase the game, you do not really 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.479
 I think it's going to work and come on, let's go. 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.180
 see how it's going to be really cool and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.599
 player passing by and then 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.389
 that goes pro motion with one on the ball by 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.750
 The other side, then, it's pretty cool, cool. 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:17.700
 I really liked fucking hell, I think 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.350
 they did it with basically 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.870
 thinking of messi is that more uses 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.110
 enough that up because the messi is cover 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.090
 of fifa then use a messi there and legal 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.050
 Dude, I really liked the system. 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.240
 in the legal twin legal and now personal to 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.490
 The next thing I'm going to tell you is 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.300
 this is about the Brazilian teams that 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.270
 are confirmed on fifa 16 exactly 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.550
 Brazilian teams confirmed the 16 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.290
 I'm telling you this, it's for 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.630
 I read in virtual art accept the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.480
 faces in contact and then it is very difficult 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.980
 no lie but they did not speak 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.830
 exactly which teams are confirmed 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.410
 not all yet because there is still 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.750
 negotiating with some but guys 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.480
 I guarantee that at least I know five 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.270
 Italians but at least I do not know about 10 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.340
 15 clubs will be in the movie 16 and 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.500
 Aventis graduates maybe 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.590
 Maybe there's a problem there. 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 license to all as they were 14 is in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.959
 14 03 he to 0 13 12 and such 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.630
 maybe it's some problem but the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.489
 principle is finding licensing all 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.560
 Brazilian clubs are ahead of the 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.260
 Riparian and maybe then some of 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.510
 b series but right but such principle 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.090
 principle would even be right but then face 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.489
 It's confirmed the teams are confirmed. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.780
 to be able to play with Brazilian teams now 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.420
 is cheering for your club to be there in 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.269
 licensed teams licensed Nelton there 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.470
 managed to get away with everyone, huh? 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.200
 gradually releasing more 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.870
 information on which the club which will 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.489
 be licensed or not but at first it is 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.010
 That's what I have to tell you. 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.290
 so video very quickly umbu talking 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.120
 a bit about the new philosophy 16 in 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.700
 question of the gameplay that the new system 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.470
 to define the new touch dublin and also 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.980
