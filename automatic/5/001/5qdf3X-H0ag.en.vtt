a battery to power it up you plug it in
the<00:02:33.420> wall<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.409> have<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> worry<00:02:34.799> so

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.589 
port on the back of the device right
here<00:02:53.699> and<00:02:55.099> that's<00:02:56.099> for<00:02:56.430> connecting<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.209> Ouya

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
here and that's for connecting the Ouya

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.459 
here and that's for connecting the Ouya
to<00:02:57.719> your<00:02:58.049> computer<00:02:58.879> there's<00:02:59.879> also<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.359> USB<00:03:00.989> 2.0

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.140 
point oh and speaking of the controller
let's<00:03:27.389> take<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> closer<00:03:27.930> look<00:03:28.079> at<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:29.150> fits

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
let's take a closer look at it fits

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.069 
let's take a closer look at it fits
nicely<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.689> hand<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.169> in<00:03:31.949> my<00:03:32.370> opinion

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
nicely in the hand and in my opinion

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
nicely in the hand and in my opinion
it's<00:03:34.079> pretty<00:03:34.319> substantial<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.250> doesn't<00:03:35.879> feel

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it's pretty substantial it doesn't feel

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.509 
it's pretty substantial it doesn't feel
cheap<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.540> anything<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:38.040> setup<00:03:38.310> is

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519

actually<00:04:09.840> think<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.229> pretty<00:04:10.349> cool<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:11.069> I

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
actually think it's pretty cool like I

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.610 
actually think it's pretty cool like I
said<00:04:11.219> it's<00:04:11.669> pretty<00:04:12.419> substantial<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.049> my<00:04:13.169> hands

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
said it's pretty substantial in my hands

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
fan in here and it's pretty quiet

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.980 
fan in here and it's pretty quiet
although<00:05:26.280> if<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.640> put<00:05:26.850> your<00:05:26.880> ear<00:05:27.240> up<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.690> if

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
although if you put your ear up to it if

although if you put your ear up to it if
you've<00:05:28.380> been<00:05:28.500> running<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.920> for<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:29.160> while<00:05:29.370> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
you've been running it for a while you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.040 
you've been running it for a while you
can<00:05:29.670> probably<00:05:29.910> hear<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.300> fan<00:05:30.540> but<00:05:30.900> it's

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
can probably hear the fan but it's

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.960 
can probably hear the fan but it's
nothing<00:05:31.530> that's<00:05:31.830> going<00:05:32.040> to<00:05:32.130> be<00:05:32.250> distracting

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
nothing that's going to be distracting

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.150 
nothing that's going to be distracting
when<00:05:33.300> you're<00:05:33.420> playing<00:05:33.660> games<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.010> let

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
when you're playing games on it so let

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.770 
when you're playing games on it so let

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
me just turn it on here and you see the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.520 
me just turn it on here and you see the
little<00:05:39.930> oh<00:05:40.200> yeah<00:05:40.500> light<00:05:40.770> up<00:05:40.980> top<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:42.350> as<00:05:43.350> I

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530

little oh yeah light up top and as I
bring<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:43.860> closer<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.910> probably<00:05:45.300> can't<00:05:45.540> even

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
bring it closer you probably can't even

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.420 
bring it closer you probably can't even
hear<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.140> because<00:05:46.290> I<00:05:46.470> don't<00:05:46.650> think<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:47.010> fan<00:05:47.250> is

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
