00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.720
 the perfect amount of protein after 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.720
 of the cream of hazelnuts and cocoa 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.620
 total is the kitchen of I wanted to help you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.809
 so you could tell me about this whole process 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.719
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.449
 for hot cakes are a third of a cup 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.750
 Oat flakes four clear of 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.690

 zero calories after having everything 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 first we will do is mix each one 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 of the ingredients in liquefied 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.110
 al is adding all the ingredients 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.150
 we have to be careful not to spill 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.930
 nothing that we can become a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.450
 great disaster 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.850
 As you realize, I am somewhat slow in 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.740
 this process but I did it with a lot 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.740
 careful because I was afraid to ruin it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 and I hope you do not despair 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.130
 when you finish you will have a mass that 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.020
 It is super nice and very delicious is 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.539
 now we are going to be placing little in 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 little in a Teflon pan and if it is 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.670
 necessary uses a little spray 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.920
 non-stick in my case do not need it 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.840
 the result of all this work will be 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.860
 some delicious hot cakes that I hope will 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 like the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.300
 then to accompany the hot cakes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 that we already have ready we will make the cream 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.220
 of cacao and hazelnuts light 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.190
 ingredients that we are going to occupy are the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.750
 following 300 grams of hazelnuts 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.660
 previously soaked and toasted 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.140
 a spoonful of cocoa powder and without 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.600
 sugar 4 sachets of sweetener 0 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.840
 calories and to decorate this we will be 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.099
 expresses 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.099
 and silver note 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.650
 what we have to do is liquefy the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.050
 roasted hazelnuts the spoonful of cocoa 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.840
 and the sweetener until you get 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.750
 a creamy consistency is somewhat delayed 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.190
 this process and they will despair but 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.740
 I swear that after a while 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.840
 perfect at the moment of gathering the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.580
 ingredients of the hazelnut cream are 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 it complicated me a bit so I decided 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.850
 add a trickle of water but if you 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.390
 you want you can use coconut oil or 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.390
 vegetable oil 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 ah 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.800

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800
