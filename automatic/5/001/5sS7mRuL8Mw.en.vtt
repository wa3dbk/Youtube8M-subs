00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.589
 alpha gaming again here terror 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.779
 commenting and as you can see in the title of the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 video let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.210
 evolution map pack voucher went out 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.500
 Yesterday the official trailer and good will 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.179
 talk a little about the maps of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.230
 multiplayer and zombies especially the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.660
 of the zombies what is it that we 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 interesting to us really and good 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 let's talk about the maps of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.980
 multiplayer a little bit these are very 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.830
 handsome by the end including a map a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 snow map and then to other maps 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 also that are invented in China not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 I know if it will have to do something with that with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 zombies since the new zombie map 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.370
 it will be set in china, it is worth everything 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.090
 what we said in the previous video of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 that a man had hacked the game and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 he had played the dlc all of that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.690
 it's a lie, it's just an invention, almost nothing 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 of that or nothing is the real therefore 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 we are going to base now on things 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 confirmed all this is what I'm going 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 to say now it is fully confirmed 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.590
 ok and well let's start talking a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 little bit of the map and well first thing 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 what we have to know is that it will be like 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 a building is worth a building with several 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.400
 plants that we will be there enclosed 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 and going up and down depends on 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.869
 what plant do we want to go what plant 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 we want to go to accumulate to prove box to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.790
 open the stream or even how to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 call to improve and we will have to do 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.340
 through surely it will be an elevator or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 descending by plates or 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 plates platforms what I have today 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 fact of theory is that as it has only been 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.619
 seen how it descends is that it appears 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 we will appear above the whole and when and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.700
 we will have to go extending by 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.080
 the platforms and when we get down 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.429
 all we will find a lift 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.060
 that will allow us all over the map 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.860
 this is not sure it's worth a theory 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.119
 what have I done and well let's talk 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.619
 a little bit more of the things that there are 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.539
 confirmed are, for example, the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 characters it has been confirmed that the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.909
 characters are the old characters and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.729
 We already saw that in the trailer yesterday 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.890
 so they will not return nor rites nor 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.369
 I takeo none of these things that to me 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.289
 It disappoints me a lot and well we're going to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.600
 see what else we have here what is 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.060
 also quite interesting is that no 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.540
 there is no indication that any 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 transport as the transit bus that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.810
 no train as had been said in the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 rumor therefore we would be talking 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.130
 in a survival mode type dlc 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
 of whites 1 worth thing that is 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.069
 pretty good and I liked it more than 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.230
 all this and that will not be way 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.630
 transit will not be a map divided into 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.420
 different areas and what they have 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.459
 brought back 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.040
 is another game mode that is called 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.980
 turner that I thought very well that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.390
 innovate with that is like a lot like the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.459
 houses that would make modern warfare2 that 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.310
 I could play as zombie type but super 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.520
 less currado and now this I guess that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.870
 will be in a private and in the good when 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.060
 let's go in the games 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.370
 we have on the site that we can 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.530
 select all of the transit and in the 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.819
 good money area you know that I do not know 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.010
 can explain in the area of ​​money not 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.040
 Well, I think it can be applied to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.170
 there and when you enter, you will get the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.750
 mode of this tournament mode and when 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.390
 enter the turn mode nets was a player 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.459
 will be alive and will be a person and all 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.569
 others will become zombies and if the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.910
 zombies catch the player because they 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.380
 will become a person and the other will 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
 will become zombie and so on 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.330
 until until they want no I do not know 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.700
 how it's going to end up really but good 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.250
 it's pretty well pretty innovated and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.959
 well it seems to be a pretty dlc 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.819
 pretty curried so I recommend you 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.200
 I would go for the season pack I'm not 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.630
 na advertising and nothing you do not 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.370
 think here that they have already signed me 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.159
 nothing 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.629
 and well, nothing else I wanted to comment 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.640
