mountain<00:02:23.560> bikes<00:02:23.740> think<00:02:24.010> Intermountain<00:02:24.760> bike

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
mountain bikes think Intermountain bike

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.780 
mountain bikes think Intermountain bike
riders<00:02:26.380> think<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.830> terms<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.160> inches<00:02:27.550> exactly

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
riders think in terms of inches exactly

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.590 
riders think in terms of inches exactly

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
26 27 529 Zach and basically that's a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.290 
26 27 529 Zach and basically that's a
full<00:02:34.600> titanium<00:02:34.990> frame<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> steel<00:02:36.910> rigid

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
full titanium frame with a steel rigid

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.490 
full titanium frame with a steel rigid
fork<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.410> finish<00:02:38.770> on<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.960> brushed

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
fork the finish on it is a brushed

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.760 
fork the finish on it is a brushed
finish<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.310> then<00:02:42.580> we<00:02:43.420> etched<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:44.140> some<00:02:44.440> star

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
finish and then we etched in some star

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.230 
finish and then we etched in some star
designs<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.070> proprietary

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
designs and then we have a proprietary

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.440 
designs and then we have a proprietary
tinted<00:02:49.240> clear<00:02:49.570> direct<00:02:50.020> metal<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.740> we<00:02:50.950> have

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
tinted clear direct metal that we have

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.710 
tinted clear direct metal that we have
developed<00:02:53.850> specifically<00:02:54.850> for<00:02:55.030> coating<00:02:55.510> over

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
developed specifically for coating over

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
developed specifically for coating over
titanium<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> transparent<00:02:57.310> yeah

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
titanium it's like a transparent yeah

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.780 
titanium it's like a transparent yeah
and<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.690> see<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.470> brush<00:02:59.800> marks<00:03:00.340> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and so you can see the brush marks the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.480 
and so you can see the brush marks the
brush<00:03:01.120> strokes<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.810> also<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.380> star<00:03:03.040> designs

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
brush strokes and also the star designs

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.370 
brush strokes and also the star designs
that<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.540> right<00:03:06.390> leave<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.510> Carl<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.020> to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
that so right leave it to Carl to to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.500 
that so right leave it to Carl to to
come<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.860> how<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.400> make<00:03:09.640> titanium<00:03:10.270> even

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
come up with how to make titanium even

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.980 
come up with how to make titanium even
prettier<00:03:11.340> yeah<00:03:12.340> yeah<00:03:12.820> well<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.360> have<00:03:13.540> actually

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
prettier yeah yeah well we have actually

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.890 
prettier yeah yeah well we have actually
a<00:03:14.020> huge<00:03:14.500> range<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.700> options<00:03:16.180> for<00:03:16.360> finishes

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
a huge range of options for finishes

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.000 
a huge range of options for finishes
both<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.350> steel<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.950> titanium<00:03:18.130> back<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:20.110> 60

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
both on steel and titanium back in 60

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.170 
both on steel and titanium back in 60
2075<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.270> what<00:03:22.750> do<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.870> see<00:03:22.990> as<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.110> merits<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
2075 but what do you see as a merits of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.020 
2075 but what do you see as a merits of
the<00:03:25.180> new<00:03:25.270> wheel<00:03:25.480> size<00:03:25.890> well<00:03:26.890> first<00:03:27.790> off

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the new wheel size well first off

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.780 
the new wheel size well first off
without<00:03:28.360> belittling<00:03:29.140> other<00:03:29.680> wheel<00:03:29.980> sizes<00:03:30.310> I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
without belittling other wheel sizes I

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.449 
without belittling other wheel sizes I
think<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.270> it's<00:03:31.900> really<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.890> right

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
think that it's really the the right

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.820 
think that it's really the the right
bike<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.330> occasion<00:03:34.620> mm-hmm<00:03:35.620> so

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
bike for the right occasion mm-hmm so

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.490 
bike for the right occasion mm-hmm so
not<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.550> say<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.209> somebody<00:03:37.540> needs<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.230> know

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
not to say that somebody needs you know

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.290 
not to say that somebody needs you know
several<00:03:38.770> bikes<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.220> their<00:03:39.370> quiver<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:40.120> it's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
several bikes in their quiver but it's

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.410 
several bikes in their quiver but it's
really<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.050> style<00:03:41.560> riding<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.130> do<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.760> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
really the style riding you do and you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.630 
really the style riding you do and you
know<00:03:43.450> where<00:03:43.780> where<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.500> live<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.370> type<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
know where where you live the type of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.140 
know where where you live the type of
terrain<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.420> kind<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.930> stuff<00:03:47.850> first<00:03:48.850> off

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
terrain that kind of stuff first off

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.850 
terrain that kind of stuff first off
just<00:03:49.450> from<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.780> frame<00:03:50.050> builder<00:03:50.410> standpoint

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
just from a frame builder standpoint

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.900 
just from a frame builder standpoint
there's<00:03:52.700> some<00:03:53.770> fitting<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.860> 29<00:03:55.340> inch<00:03:55.370> wheel

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
there's some fitting a 29 inch wheel

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.570 
there's some fitting a 29 inch wheel
into<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.840> frame<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.860> slightly<00:03:58.100> alter

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
into a frame you have to slightly alter

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.890 
into a frame you have to slightly alter
the<00:03:58.730> geometry<00:03:59.330> it's<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.600> little<00:03:59.780> more

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
the geometry it's a little more

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.460 
the geometry it's a little more
contrived<00:04:00.380> right<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.030> those<00:04:02.750> geometry

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
contrived right so and those geometry

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.450 
contrived right so and those geometry
compromises<00:04:04.370> do<00:04:05.530> balance<00:04:06.530> out<00:04:06.740> slightly

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
compromises do balance out slightly

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.820 
compromises do balance out slightly
because<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.810> game<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.590> know<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
because of the game you know the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.130 
because of the game you know the
benefits<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.640> 29<00:04:10.940> inch<00:04:11.270> wheel<00:04:11.480> but<00:04:11.840> you

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
benefits of the 29 inch wheel but you

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.870 
benefits of the 29 inch wheel but you
don't<00:04:12.320> have<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.500> make<00:04:12.710> any<00:04:12.950> compromises<00:04:13.550> with

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
don't have to make any compromises with

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.080 
don't have to make any compromises with
the<00:04:14.000> 2075<00:04:14.750> because<00:04:15.230> it's<00:04:15.410> fitting<00:04:15.800> into<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
the 2075 because it's fitting into the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.440 
the 2075 because it's fitting into the
same<00:04:18.019> geometry<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.890> wheelbase<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.670> a<00:04:19.730> 26-inch

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
same geometry and wheelbase of a 26-inch

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.270 
same geometry and wheelbase of a 26-inch
wheel<00:04:20.720> bike<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.260> see<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.769> only<00:04:22.040> difference

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
wheel bike I see the only difference

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.460 
wheel bike I see the only difference
between<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.420> 26-inch<00:04:23.990> wheel<00:04:24.230> bike

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
between this and a 26-inch wheel bike

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.650 
between this and a 26-inch wheel bike
the<00:04:24.770> bottom<00:04:25.070> bracket<00:04:25.430> height<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:26.000> adjusted

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the bottom bracket height is adjusted

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.590 
the bottom bracket height is adjusted
for<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.350> additional<00:04:27.860> radius<00:04:28.580> right<00:04:29.000> provided

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
for the additional radius right provided

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
for the additional radius right provided
by<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.900> wheel<00:04:30.500> size<00:04:30.800> right<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:33.040> basically<00:04:35.620> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
by the wheel size right so basically you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.590 
by the wheel size right so basically you
don't<00:04:36.919> have<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.400> long<00:04:37.669> wheelbase<00:04:38.090> when

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
don't have like a long wheelbase when

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.270 
don't have like a long wheelbase when
you're<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.840> tighter<00:04:39.110> whinier<00:04:39.800> terrain

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you're in tighter whinier terrain

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.360 
you're in tighter whinier terrain
there's<00:04:40.760> not<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.940> longer<00:04:41.390> wheelbase<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:43.250> know

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
there's not a longer wheelbase you know

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.880 
there's not a longer wheelbase you know
that<00:04:43.880> you're<00:04:44.120> working<00:04:44.330> against<00:04:44.990> right<00:04:45.260> so

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
that you're working against right so

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.850 
that you're working against right so
right<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:47.150> addition<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.440> know<00:04:48.470> it's

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
right in addition to that you know it's

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.790 
right in addition to that you know it's
basically<00:04:49.640> my<00:04:49.880> feeling<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.510> we're<00:04:51.110> 29-inch

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800

has<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:41.000> know<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> slower<00:05:41.690> acceleration

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
has you know a slower acceleration

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.560 
has you know a slower acceleration
a<00:05:43.780> lot<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.530> people<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:45.040> are<00:05:45.220> in<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:46.090> live<00:05:46.360> in

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
a lot of people that are in that live in

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.740 
a lot of people that are in that live in
areas<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:47.080> are<00:05:47.410> really<00:05:47.710> whiny<00:05:48.610> rocky<00:05:49.210> tight

trails<00:05:50.110> will<00:05:50.380> try<00:05:50.590> 29-inch<00:05:51.400> because<00:05:51.640> they

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
trails will try 29-inch because they

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.520 
trails will try 29-inch because they
want<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:51.940> roll<00:05:52.120> out<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.390> bumps<00:05:52.570> but<00:05:53.410> then

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
want to roll out the bumps but then

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.590 
want to roll out the bumps but then
they'll<00:05:53.680> go<00:05:53.800> back<00:05:54.040> to<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.340> 26-inch<00:05:55.150> because

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
they'll go back to the 26-inch because

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.850 
they'll go back to the 26-inch because
they're<00:05:55.750> constantly<00:05:56.140> accelerating<00:05:56.410> and

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
they're constantly accelerating and

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.710 
they're constantly accelerating and
decelerating<00:05:56.920> going<00:05:57.850> so<00:05:58.090> they're<00:05:58.240> feeling

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
decelerating going so they're feeling

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.870 
decelerating going so they're feeling
that<00:05:58.900> slower<00:05:59.230> acceleration<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.460> they<00:06:00.670> just

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
that slower acceleration and they just

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.750 
that slower acceleration and they just
feel<00:06:01.120> slower<00:06:01.630> at<00:06:01.840> those<00:06:02.020> times<00:06:02.290> all<00:06:02.680> right<00:06:02.770> so

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
feel slower at those times all right so

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.240 
feel slower at those times all right so
this<00:06:04.030> is<00:06:04.360> as<00:06:04.840> big<00:06:05.080> as<00:06:05.230> a<00:06:05.260> wheel<00:06:05.560> as<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:05.890> can<00:06:06.040> fit

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
this is as big as a wheel as you can fit

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.780 
this is as big as a wheel as you can fit
in<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.550> standard<00:06:06.660> geometry<00:06:08.430> only<00:06:09.430> slightly

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
in a standard geometry only slightly

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.570 
in a standard geometry only slightly
bigger<00:06:10.090> than<00:06:10.210> a<00:06:10.360> 26-inch<00:06:11.080> wheel<00:06:11.320> so<00:06:11.590> it<00:06:11.770> had<00:06:12.340> it

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
bigger than a 26-inch wheel so it had it

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.160 
bigger than a 26-inch wheel so it had it
doesn't<00:06:12.790> have<00:06:13.090> as<00:06:13.240> much<00:06:13.420> of<00:06:13.480> that<00:06:13.720> slower

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
doesn't have as much of that slower

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.310 
doesn't have as much of that slower
acceleration<00:06:14.500> as<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.340> 29<00:06:16.090> inch<00:06:16.120> wood<00:06:16.570> yeah<00:06:17.290> I

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
acceleration as a 29 inch wood yeah I

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.470 
acceleration as a 29 inch wood yeah I
have<00:06:17.530> noticed<00:06:17.980> but<00:06:18.580> also<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:19.030> positive

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
have noticed but also the positive

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.350 
have noticed but also the positive
geometry<00:06:20.050> of<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.200> 26-minute<00:06:20.830> bike<00:06:21.160> so<00:06:21.580> I've

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
geometry of a 26-minute bike so I've

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.390 
geometry of a 26-minute bike so I've
noticed<00:06:22.600> myself<00:06:22.960> and<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.530> lot<00:06:23.560> of<00:06:23.710> my<00:06:23.890> peers<00:06:24.130> are

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
noticed myself and a lot of my peers are

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.490 
noticed myself and a lot of my peers are
going<00:06:24.880> towards<00:06:24.970> he's<00:06:25.360> ultra<00:06:26.350> expensive

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
going towards he's ultra expensive

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.490 
going towards he's ultra expensive
wheelsets<00:06:27.160> like<00:06:27.280> industry<00:06:27.670> 9<00:06:28.230> that<00:06:29.230> are<00:06:29.350> very

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
wheelsets like industry 9 that are very

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.290 
wheelsets like industry 9 that are very
light<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:30.720> counteract<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:32.970> know<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.150> actual

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
light to counteract the know the actual

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.020 
light to counteract the know the actual
rolling<00:06:34.990> yeah<00:06:35.650> part<00:06:36.130> of<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.370> bike<00:06:36.550> rider

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
rolling yeah part of the bike rider

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.070 
rolling yeah part of the bike rider
right<00:06:37.450> yeah<00:06:37.930> and<00:06:38.230> it<00:06:38.380> compensates<00:06:39.310> for<00:06:39.610> my<00:06:40.080> for

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
right yeah and it compensates for my for

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
right yeah and it compensates for my for
the<00:06:41.380> the<00:06:41.950> slowness<00:06:42.220> in<00:06:43.260> acceleration<00:06:44.260> and

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
the the slowness in acceleration and

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.980 
the the slowness in acceleration and
yeah<00:06:45.310> and<00:06:45.490> I<00:06:45.520> have<00:06:45.640> a<00:06:45.669> good<00:06:46.240> setup<00:06:46.480> but<00:06:46.690> I<00:06:46.720> can

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
yeah and I have a good setup but I can

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.680 
yeah and I have a good setup but I can
see<00:06:47.200> this<00:06:47.230> as<00:06:47.530> being<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:48.000> an<00:06:49.000> even<00:06:49.510> better

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
see this as being a an even better

see this as being a an even better
balance<00:06:50.020> I<00:06:50.110> think<00:06:50.380> as<00:06:50.919> this<00:06:51.450> as<00:06:52.450> this<00:06:52.750> platform

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
balance I think as this as this platform

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.040 
balance I think as this as this platform
is<00:06:53.860> a<00:06:53.919> little<00:06:54.130> bit<00:06:54.250> more<00:06:54.490> widely<00:06:55.000> accepted<00:06:55.750> the

us another bike later but right this is

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.920 
us another bike later but right this is
very<00:07:23.710> exciting<00:07:24.040> thank<00:07:24.550> you<00:07:24.640> very<00:07:24.700> much<00:07:24.930> thank
