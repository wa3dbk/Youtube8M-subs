00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 and for that i need the model again 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 you 're growing that up already 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 I used to wax 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 namely, can process a spatula 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:33.950
 take or I take the back of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:37.559
 a brush and then I have to go here 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 to line my area with wax 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 this is almost the open area of ​​the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.960
 wound 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.960
 I'm doing such a rectangle 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.730
 with the chip I have the heads 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.730
 cut off 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.470
 and then I have to fit in that well 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.470
 so I can cut away a bit 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 and then I put in here the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 now i have to end the here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 coaches with the wax cover that it 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.380
 Looks like we're really out of this 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.410
 I can get out of meat 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 Take another coop and I'll do it here 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.580
 The edges are a bit smooth 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.030
 then we did not break anymore 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.490
 this is on the edges on that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.430
 the transition right skin is not like that 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:26.470
 It looks so easy 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:29.470
 real over here I see 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.870
 just a little bit following the sq tips 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.510
 house I still give a little bit 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.590
 more about up here so the end of the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 culture has been exhausted so far 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.880
 then make a little liquid make up 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.760
 already it looks like really nasty 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.760
 gaping wound 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.140
 so and now it's time to paint 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.680
 then a brush and me red 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680
 loving unions 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:43.849
 many that they will take from you then i will 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:56.260
 a little bit of the red lipstick 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:04:02.030
 and there would be such a nice one here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:06.310
 paint under the coachman brian and also 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.310
 the most beautiful model on the edges 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.440
 then again something of the black eyeliner 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 Dab clean in here 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.560
 then watch out again that you 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:31.610
 clean the eyeliner before putting it on 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:33.560
 again reinsteckt so then so far 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:39.349
 I can and can with the art blood 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:42.289
 I carry on brush 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:49.160
 little bit of the blood on and go 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:54.169
 right down here but on top of the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.260
 edges of the wound on it and also 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.860
 of course a little something on the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.860
 youtube bones 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.080
 and that's how the finished result looks 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.720
 out with my scary bone 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.220

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.479
