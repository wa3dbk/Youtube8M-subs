00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
this frame it was like like nothing when

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.160

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
liter but this one is almost half half

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.960 
liter but this one is almost half half
from<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.390> weight<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:06.050> incredible<00:02:06.970> one

from the weight it's just incredible one
of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.149> velum<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.630> we've<00:02:08.780> been<00:02:08.929> working<00:02:09.320> on

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
of the velum that we've been working on

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.630 
of the velum that we've been working on
is<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.619> there's<00:02:09.860> now<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> lab<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.490> California

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is that there's now a lab in California

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.120 
is that there's now a lab in California
or<00:02:11.390> actually<00:02:11.750> where<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.290> test<00:02:12.890> out<00:02:13.100> new

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
or actually where we test out new

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.120 
or actually where we test out new
manufacturing<00:02:14.120> techniques<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.860> found

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
manufacturing techniques and so we found

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.070 
manufacturing techniques and so we found
better<00:02:16.430> ways<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.730> control<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.480> inside<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
better ways to control the inside of the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.930 
better ways to control the inside of the
tube<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.709> better<00:02:18.980> ways<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.220> stiffen<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
tube from better ways to stiffen the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.660 
tube from better ways to stiffen the
tubes<00:02:20.200> take<00:02:21.200> material<00:02:21.740> out<00:02:21.830> without<00:02:22.310> losing

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
tubes take material out without losing

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.270 
tubes take material out without losing
any<00:02:22.790> stiffness<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:24.620> really<00:02:24.950> hard<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
any stiffness and that's really hard to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.970 
any stiffness and that's really hard to
do<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.670> all<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.320> maybe<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.800> or<00:02:27.920> two

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
do when all you have is maybe one or two

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980 
do when all you have is maybe one or two
engineers<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.820> they're<00:02:29.000> sketching<00:02:29.870> out

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
engineers and they're sketching out

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.930 
engineers and they're sketching out
models<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.500> everything<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.340> leave<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
models and everything but you leave it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.780 
models and everything but you leave it
to<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> manufacturer<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.900> supplier

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
to the manufacturer the supplier

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
to the manufacturer the supplier
somewhere<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:35.120> figure<00:02:35.480> out<00:02:35.570> how<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.810> how<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
somewhere to figure out how to how to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.530 
somewhere to figure out how to how to
produce<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.340> how<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> really<00:02:37.850> make<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.420> now

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
produce it how to really make it so now

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.330 
produce it how to really make it so now
that<00:02:38.600> we<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.140> in-house<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:40.040> have<00:02:40.160> that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
that we have that in-house we have that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.310 
that we have that in-house we have that
in<00:02:40.430> California<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.510> opens<00:02:42.020> up<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.230> lot

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
in California it really opens up a lot

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.110 
in California it really opens up a lot
of<00:02:42.470> opportunities<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.100> figure<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.550> better

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
of opportunities to figure out better

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.020 
of opportunities to figure out better
ways<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.690> things<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:46.130> scale<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.940> up

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
ways to do things and then scale it up

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.650 
ways to do things and then scale it up
from<00:02:47.330> there<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:48.430> larger<00:02:49.430> production<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.540> this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
from there to larger production so this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.780 
from there to larger production so this
is<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.080> made<00:02:51.410> by<00:02:51.980> hand<00:02:52.310> by<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
is actually made by hand by the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.110 
is actually made by hand by the
engineers<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.200> our<00:02:54.500> engineering<00:02:54.950> group<00:02:55.220> they

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
engineers so our engineering group they

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.910 
engineers so our engineering group they
do<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.390> manufacturing<00:02:56.630> as<00:02:57.200> well

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
do the manufacturing as well

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.370 
do the manufacturing as well
so<00:02:58.550> actually<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.120> same<00:02:59.360> guys<00:02:59.630> who<00:02:59.660> design<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
so actually the same guys who design it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.130 
so actually the same guys who design it
actually<00:03:01.100> do<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> carbon<00:03:01.580> layout<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.810> our<00:03:02.959> own

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
actually do the carbon layout in our own

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.050 
actually do the carbon layout in our own
facility<00:03:03.740> so<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:04.250> completely<00:03:04.490> controlled

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
facility so it's completely controlled

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.090 
facility so it's completely controlled
by<00:03:05.150> Sorella<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.200> really<00:03:06.410> get<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> best<00:03:06.680> lure

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
by Sorella you really get the best lure

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.170 
by Sorella you really get the best lure
if<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.340> these<00:03:07.490> guys<00:03:07.700> thinking<00:03:08.150> about

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
if you have these guys thinking about

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.790 
if you have these guys thinking about
better<00:03:08.510> manufacturing<00:03:09.170> techniques<00:03:09.530> and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
better manufacturing techniques and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.830 
better manufacturing techniques and
better<00:03:09.980> designs<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.730> then<00:03:11.330> they<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.690> it

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
better designs and then they make it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.390 
better designs and then they make it
themselves<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.500> we'll<00:03:12.860> make<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.040> available

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
themselves and we'll make that available

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.370 
themselves and we'll make that available
to<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.000> public<00:03:14.120> pretty<00:03:14.600> soon<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.200> course

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
to the public pretty soon but of course

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.290 
to the public pretty soon but of course
very<00:03:15.650> early<00:03:15.830> adopters<00:03:16.340> because<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:17.150> don't

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
very early adopters because we don't

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.699 
very early adopters because we don't
have<00:03:17.390> many<00:03:17.600> engineers<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:18.320> can<00:03:18.530> make

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
have many engineers so they can make

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.440 
have many engineers so they can make
maybe<00:03:19.190> one<00:03:19.459> frame<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> day<00:03:19.970> or<00:03:20.150> something<00:03:20.330> like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
maybe one frame a day or something like

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.140 
maybe one frame a day or something like
that<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.650> abuse<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.250> pros<00:03:22.490> put<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
that the abuse the pros put on the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.960 
that the abuse the pros put on the
product<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:24.250> unbelievable<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.310> comparison

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
product is unbelievable in comparison

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.840 
product is unbelievable in comparison
with<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.510> normal<00:03:27.230> writer<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.770> mean<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.520> not<00:03:28.700> to

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
with a normal writer I mean it's not to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.610 
with a normal writer I mean it's not to
say<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.030> we<00:03:29.209> use<00:03:29.390> tor<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:30.020> someone<00:03:30.350> way<00:03:30.560> to

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
say that we use tor as someone way to

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.470 
say that we use tor as someone way to
figure<00:03:31.100> out<00:03:31.250> if<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.489> frame<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.760> strong<00:03:32.209> enough

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
figure out if the frame is strong enough

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080 
figure out if the frame is strong enough
we<00:03:32.660> already<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.440> lab<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:34.520> it's

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
we already do that in the lab but it's

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.150 
we already do that in the lab but it's
an<00:03:35.270> extra<00:03:35.690> way<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.320> figure<00:03:36.739> out<00:03:36.920> for<00:03:37.100> example

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
an extra way to figure out for example

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.340 
an extra way to figure out for example
if<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.850> bike<00:03:38.030> also<00:03:38.239> handles<00:03:38.780> well<00:03:38.930> enough<00:03:39.170> I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
if the bike also handles well enough I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.229 
if the bike also handles well enough I
mean<00:03:39.560> when<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:39.860> saw<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:40.250> light<00:03:40.610> friend<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.180> said

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
mean when I saw this light friend I said

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.160 
mean when I saw this light friend I said
it<00:03:41.570> have<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.140> be<00:03:42.550> not<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.700> stiff<00:03:43.970> when<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> try

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
it have to be not that stiff when I try

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.930 
it have to be not that stiff when I try
this<00:03:45.230> party<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.860> her<00:03:46.010> Lynch<00:03:46.280> brains<00:03:46.640> had

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
this party that her Lynch brains had

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.090 
this party that her Lynch brains had
corners<00:03:47.360> with<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.959> there<00:03:48.170> was<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.650> was<00:03:48.800> just

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
corners with it so there was it was just

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.449 
corners with it so there was it was just
so<00:03:49.280> stiff<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.680> acted<00:03:51.680> how<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:51.860> wanted

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
so stiff and and just acted how I wanted

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.300 
so stiff and and just acted how I wanted
so<00:03:53.120> there<00:03:53.269> was<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.390> really<00:03:53.930> incredible<00:03:54.830> ha

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
so there was a really incredible ha

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.190 
so there was a really incredible ha
stick<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.090> podcast<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:56.690> she<00:03:56.840> was<00:03:56.930> from

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
stick to the podcast but she was from

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.350
