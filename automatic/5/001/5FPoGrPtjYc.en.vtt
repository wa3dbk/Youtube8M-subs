00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.180
 twisted in two turns in the middle 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.270

 column bottom pair of orange rezinochek 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:49.869
 then we move a couple to the left of the column 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.869
 rezinochek orange on the right column 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.070
 must wear a loop of three rubber bands 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.460
 which we cheat 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.460
 and put on the left column 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.460

 we throw off only the words of the column dress 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.370
 next pair of rezinochek 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.160
 cum throw off the left column couple

 rezinochek 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.620
 and to the right of the column here is the next pair 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.390
 reaching for the top pair to the middle 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.150
 put on another pair of orange 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.250
 rezinochek skim off the left column and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.530
 right column a couple of orange rezinochek 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.050
 who 's the one behind the top pair 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:56.280
 rezinochek and move the left column 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:00.300
 a pair of rubber bands on the right column then we 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.480
 look again here we have about Putin here 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.200
 this has been, as it were composed of two 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.690
 there are such chains 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.290
 and see these are our middle, and that's 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.950
 consisting of here is such a loop we 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:22.080
 drop it and put it on the left column 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.660
 here we throw this loop on the left 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.519
 column then we put on 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 a pair of rubber bands on two columns throw off 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:40.019
 on the left column of our loop here 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.280
 we put on a couple of the following rezinochek 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.900
 orange color we throw off the words 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.810
 column a couple of rezinochek 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.959
 from the right column here's the next pair 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 through the top pair 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.860
 here she is already putting on the last pair 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.799
 our rezinochek throw off its 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.799
 a column and on the right column here this pair 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.799
 rezinochek 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.470
 it should be 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:21.079
 only 6 rezinochek one pair on the left 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.840
 a column and five pairs on the right columns 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.050
 let's count carefully here with us 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.840
 just have five pairs then we put on 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.190
 one rezinochku green 2 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.730
 column and fold to the middle 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.850
 midrange orange one pair 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.450
 salt and you top and five pairs on the right 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.450
 column 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.290
 now we 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:02.360
 remove rezinochka green gum green 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:05.690
 colors on the hook do loop 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.280
 we pass through an elastic band which is with 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.330
 left side through 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.630
 in rezinochku so from the inside and 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.630
 we tighten ilja 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.940
 so here it turned out our pumpkin we her 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.940
 now spread 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.880
 so we press it with us 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.880
 cracks down 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.160
 he 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.160
 back as we got a pumpkin
