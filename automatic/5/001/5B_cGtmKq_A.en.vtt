00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
really has been self-discovery and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.660 
really has been self-discovery and
that's<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.620> word<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.920> can't<00:01:42.130> be<00:01:42.220> used<00:01:42.400> lightly

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
that's a word I can't be used lightly

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.430
