yeah<00:00:14.680> this<00:00:14.860> is<00:00:15.010> our<00:00:15.250> newest<00:00:15.910> robot<00:00:16.120> so<00:00:16.630> far<00:00:16.900> be

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
yeah this is our newest robot so far be

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.490 
yeah this is our newest robot so far be
referring<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:17.590> it<00:00:17.890> as<00:00:17.920> in<00:00:18.700> size<00:00:19.320> platform<00:00:20.320> and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
referring to it as in size platform and

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.340 
referring to it as in size platform and
the<00:00:20.890> idea<00:00:21.250> is<00:00:21.490> that<00:00:21.760> we<00:00:22.420> developed<00:00:22.990> together

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
the idea is that we developed together

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.580 
the idea is that we developed together
this<00:00:23.860> help<00:00:24.130> or<00:00:24.369> from<00:00:24.840> robotics<00:00:25.840> company<00:00:26.290> and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
this help or from robotics company and

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.030 
this help or from robotics company and
Robocop<00:00:27.070> Federation<00:00:27.930> teen<00:00:28.930> sized<00:00:29.169> robot<00:00:29.590> like

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
Robocop Federation teen sized robot like

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.140 
Robocop Federation teen sized robot like
size<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.900> it<00:00:32.619> larger<00:00:33.130> than<00:00:33.160> 90<00:00:33.460> centimeters

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
size about it larger than 90 centimeters

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.900 
size about it larger than 90 centimeters
for<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.020> human<00:00:35.500> reach<00:00:35.650> in<00:00:35.829> size<00:00:36.010> class<00:00:36.310> that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
for the human reach in size class that

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.690 
for the human reach in size class that
other<00:00:37.329> teams<00:00:37.720> should<00:00:38.079> be<00:00:38.380> able<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.860> use<00:00:39.070> so<00:00:39.400> we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
other teams should be able to use so we

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.479 
other teams should be able to use so we
tried<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.450> make<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.110> robot<00:00:41.440> as<00:00:41.800> simple<00:00:42.370> as

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
tried to make the robot as simple as

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.880 
tried to make the robot as simple as
possible<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.329> also<00:00:43.510> affordable<00:00:44.470> so<00:00:44.859> that

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
possible and also affordable so that

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.639 
possible and also affordable so that
other<00:00:45.340> teams<00:00:45.670> can<00:00:45.879> acquire<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.230> also

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
other teams can acquire it and also

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:48.750 
other teams can acquire it and also
assemble<00:00:48.309> it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
assemble it

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.150 
assemble it
maybe<00:00:49.030> repair<00:00:49.719> if<00:00:49.930> necessary<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.739> also<00:00:50.890> make

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
maybe repair if necessary and also make

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.770 
maybe repair if necessary and also make
changes<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:54.760> are<00:00:54.820> different<00:00:55.390> previous

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
changes there are different previous

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.889 
changes there are different previous
platforms<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:56.800> one<00:00:57.250> thing<00:00:57.789> that<00:00:57.820> we<00:00:58.179> looked<00:00:58.660> at

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
platforms so one thing that we looked at

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.099 
platforms so one thing that we looked at
was<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.530> Darby<00:00:59.980> Opie<00:01:00.340> robot<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:01.120> is<00:01:01.420> sold<00:01:01.809> by

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
was the Darby Opie robot that is sold by

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.110 
was the Darby Opie robot that is sold by
reporters<00:01:02.710> for<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.010> kid<00:01:03.219> size<00:01:03.370> class<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.030> I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
reporters for the kid size class and I

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.880 
reporters for the kid size class and I
think<00:01:04.330> this<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> very<00:01:04.870> nice<00:01:05.080> robot<00:01:05.530> but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
think this is a very nice robot but

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.370 
think this is a very nice robot but
unfortunately<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.360> too<00:01:07.720> small<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.020> the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
unfortunately it's too small for the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.490 
unfortunately it's too small for the
teen<00:01:08.590> size<00:01:08.800> class<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.490> we<00:01:09.820> took<00:01:10.000> like<00:01:10.990> many

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
teen size class so we took like many

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.980 
teen size class so we took like many
ideas<00:01:11.890> from<00:01:12.460> there<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.090> try<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.450> make<00:01:13.690> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
ideas from there and try to make the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.240 
ideas from there and try to make the
robot<00:01:14.320> very<00:01:15.000> simple<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:17.079> regards<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
robot very simple the regards to the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.700 
robot very simple the regards to the
Darby<00:01:18.610> Hoopoe<00:01:18.880> robot<00:01:19.240> we<00:01:19.900> have<00:01:20.079> much<00:01:20.530> more

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
Darby Hoopoe robot we have much more

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.679 
Darby Hoopoe robot we have much more
computing<00:01:21.220> power<00:01:21.280> here<00:01:21.759> because<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:22.150> dual<00:01:22.360> core

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
computing power here because a dual core

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.219 
computing power here because a dual core
the<00:01:23.380> computer<00:01:23.829> and<00:01:24.100> also<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:25.060> think<00:01:25.689> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
the computer and also I think the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.429 
the computer and also I think the
possibility<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.610> wide-angle<00:01:28.060> lens<00:01:28.450> is

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
possibility of the wide-angle lens is

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.679 
possibility of the wide-angle lens is
better<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.189> we<00:01:30.670> will<00:01:30.790> also<00:01:31.090> have<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.600> think

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
better and we will also have I think

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.399 
better and we will also have I think
better<00:01:32.200> wireless<00:01:33.159> connectivity

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.710 

it's<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> exactly<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.130> product<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.540> like

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's not exactly a product but more like

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.310 
it's not exactly a product but more like
a<00:01:42.750> prototype<00:01:43.430> currently<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:45.000> made<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.110> first

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
a prototype currently we made the first

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.820 
a prototype currently we made the first
prototype<00:01:46.740> walk<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.619> could

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
prototype walk so I think we could

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.460 
prototype walk so I think we could
produce<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> these<00:01:51.060> robots<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> next

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
produce more of these robots in the next

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 
produce more of these robots in the next
week<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.580> currently<00:01:53.820> working<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.330> my

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
week and I'm currently working with my

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
week and I'm currently working with my
administration<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.800> also<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.310> robotics

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
administration and also the robotics

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.990 
administration and also the robotics
company<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.650> find<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.550> good<00:01:59.729> way

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
company to actually find out a good way

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
company to actually find out a good way
how<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.560> distribute<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.830> robot<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:05.100> got

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
how to distribute this robot we got

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.900 
how to distribute this robot we got
support<00:02:05.909> from<00:02:06.300> robotics<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> build<00:02:07.910> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
support from robotics to build this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.470 
support from robotics to build this
prototype<00:02:09.440> prototypes<00:02:10.440> are<00:02:10.739> quite

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
prototype prototypes are quite

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.030 
prototype prototypes are quite
complicated<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:13.110> regards<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
complicated with regards to the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.449 
complicated with regards to the
mechanics<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.540> maybe<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> regards<00:02:17.190> to

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
mechanics and also maybe the regards to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.470 
mechanics and also maybe the regards to
assembling<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.890> maintenance<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:21.209> think

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
assembling and maintenance and I think

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
assembling and maintenance and I think
the<00:02:21.870> biggest<00:02:22.140> advantage<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.910> robot<00:02:24.269> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the biggest advantage of this robot is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.740 
the biggest advantage of this robot is
really<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.739> such<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> clean<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.269> simple

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
really that it's such a clean and simple

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.780 
really that it's such a clean and simple
design<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.940> course<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.600> will<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:31.790> important

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
design of course we will use important

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.960 
design of course we will use important
components<00:02:33.330> from<00:02:33.540> robotics<00:02:34.050> including<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
components from robotics including the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.110 
components from robotics including the
actuators<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> also<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.550> electronic

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
actuators and also this electronic

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.280 
actuators and also this electronic
controller<00:02:39.890> producing<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.540> very

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
controller producing more of this very

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.759 
controller producing more of this very
first<00:02:43.590> version<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:45.150> think<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.959> do<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.140> in

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
first version I think we can do it in
