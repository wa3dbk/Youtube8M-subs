00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
racing you know I grew up midget sprint

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.910 
racing you know I grew up midget sprint
cars<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.450> that's<00:02:01.840> all<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.290> we<00:02:02.470> raced<00:02:02.590> it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
cars and that's all the time we raced it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.160 
cars and that's all the time we raced it
was<00:02:03.070> fitting<00:02:03.340> night<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:04.150> feel<00:02:04.659> much<00:02:04.840> more<00:02:05.110> at

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
was fitting night so I feel much more at

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
was fitting night so I feel much more at
home<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.340> more<00:02:06.550> entertaining

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.880 

shows<00:02:10.300> us<00:02:10.539> fasteners<00:02:11.080> better<00:02:11.319> for<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.650> fans

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
shows us fasteners better for the fans

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.520 
shows us fasteners better for the fans
so<00:02:12.250> hopefully<00:02:12.700> also<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.209> better<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.530> more

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
so hopefully also on better a more

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.140 
so hopefully also on better a more
experienced<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.129> more<00:02:15.489> races<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:16.000> do

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
experienced we have more races we do

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 
experienced we have more races we do
better<00:02:17.140> we're<00:02:17.319> going<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.980> home<00:02:18.160> said

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
better we're going to get so home said

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.949 
better we're going to get so home said
being<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.790> last<00:02:18.940> race<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.450> season<00:02:19.690> I

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
being the last race of the season I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.089 
being the last race of the season I
think<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.319> going<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.860> our<00:02:20.920> better

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
think it's going to be one of our better

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.339 
think it's going to be one of our better
results<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.730> actually<00:02:22.420> done<00:02:22.780> pretty<00:02:22.810> well<00:02:23.080> at

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
results I actually done pretty well at

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.809 
results I actually done pretty well at

accident but I don't mind Homestead it's
a<00:02:35.290> bit<00:02:35.440> challenging<00:02:36.069> it's<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.420> track<00:02:37.690> really

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
a bit challenging it's the track really

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.080 
a bit challenging it's the track really
you<00:02:38.440> know<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.590> really<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.129> off<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.580> tires<00:02:39.819> go

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you know you really go off the tires go

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.729 
you know you really go off the tires go
off<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.720> makes<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.080> really<00:02:41.200> tough<00:02:41.530> out

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
off and it makes it really tough out

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.070 
off and it makes it really tough out
there<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.190> slide<00:02:42.430> around<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.940> lot<00:02:43.120> it's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
there and you slide around a lot it's

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.660 
there and you slide around a lot it's
tough<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.560> go<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> why's<00:02:45.130> there<00:02:45.430> these<00:02:45.610> days

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
tough to go to why's there these days

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.300 
tough to go to why's there these days
and<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> really<00:02:47.500> learn<00:02:47.739> having<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and it's going to really learn having a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.160 
and it's going to really learn having a
good<00:02:48.519> car<00:02:48.760> which<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.599> know<00:02:49.720> coming<00:02:49.959> off<00:02:50.140> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
good car which you know coming off a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.449 
good car which you know coming off a
place<00:02:50.440> like<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.860> where<00:02:50.920> you've<00:02:51.250> got<00:02:51.400> a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
place like this where you've got a

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.069 
place like this where you've got a
really<00:02:51.670> challenging<00:02:51.970> turns<00:02:52.569> three<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:52.930> four

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
really challenging turns three and four

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.600 
really challenging turns three and four
you<00:02:53.650> know<00:02:53.769> hopefully<00:02:53.980> we'll<00:02:54.340> be<00:02:54.459> all<00:02:54.579> right

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
you know hopefully we'll be all right

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.100 
you know hopefully we'll be all right
we'll<00:02:54.970> get<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.120> good<00:02:55.269> balance<00:02:55.390> out<00:02:55.750> there<00:02:55.959> and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
we'll get a good balance out there and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.360 
we'll get a good balance out there and
we're<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.410> we'll<00:02:56.620> run<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.040> we'll<00:02:57.130> try<00:02:57.340> a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
we're going we'll run and we'll try a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
we're going we'll run and we'll try a
will<00:02:58.299> try<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.569> make<00:02:58.720> some<00:02:58.870> magic<00:02:59.019> happen<00:02:59.200> at

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
will try and make some magic happen at

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.130 
will try and make some magic happen at
the<00:02:59.620> last<00:02:59.799> one<00:03:00.040> I'm<00:03:00.790> living<00:03:01.209> Miami<00:03:01.540> side<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> lot

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the last one I'm living Miami side a lot

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.890 
the last one I'm living Miami side a lot
of<00:03:02.290> friends<00:03:02.590> over<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.569> well<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:04.599> think

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
of friends over there and well I think
