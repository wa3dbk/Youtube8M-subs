00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039 
vegetables I've got carrots I've got
parsnips<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.400> parsnips<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:39.049> really

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
parsnips the parsnips are really

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
parsnips the parsnips are really
wonderful<00:01:40.229> i<00:01:40.619> would<00:01:40.799> i<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.100> recommend

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
wonderful i would i would recommend

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
wonderful i would i would recommend
getting<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.420> organically<00:01:43.049> grown<00:01:43.259> vegetables

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
getting my organically grown vegetables

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
getting my organically grown vegetables
the<00:01:44.070> reason<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.780> have

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the reason for this is that they have

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100 
the reason for this is that they have
been<00:01:47.250> grown<00:01:47.729> without<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> chemicals

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
been grown without the use of chemicals

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
been grown without the use of chemicals
so<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.890> good<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.880> more

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so it's good for you but more

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
so it's good for you but more
importantly<00:01:51.780> than<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> i<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
importantly than that i think is that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.090 
importantly than that i think is that
it's<00:01:53.280> good<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> soil<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.680> world

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's good for the soil so that our world

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's good for the soil so that our world
will<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.579> sustainable<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.409> either

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
will be sustainable and these are either

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
will be sustainable and these are either
sweet<00:01:59.130> potatoes<00:01:59.579> or<00:01:59.759> yams<00:01:59.790> i<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.540> know

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
sweet potatoes or yams i don't know

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.499 
sweet potatoes or yams i don't know
maybe<00:02:01.229> someone<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.770> let<00:02:02.189> us<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.729> but

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
maybe someone can let us know that but

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.860 
maybe someone can let us know that but
they're<00:02:03.659> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> orange<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
they're kind of orange and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
refrigerator and we're going to cook

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.900 
refrigerator and we're going to cook
them<00:04:25.919> by<00:04:26.280> boiling<00:04:26.669> them<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.850> saucepan<00:04:29.850> with

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
them by boiling them in a saucepan with

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.370 
them by boiling them in a saucepan with
just<00:04:30.330> enough<00:04:30.419> water<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.900> cover<00:04:30.930> them

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
just enough water to cover them

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.219 
just enough water to cover them
comfortably<00:04:32.070> for<00:04:32.970> about<00:04:33.210> four<00:04:33.600> minutes<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
comfortably for about four minutes and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.590 
comfortably for about four minutes and
then<00:04:34.380> when<00:04:35.250> that's<00:04:35.460> done<00:04:35.850> we're<00:04:36.330> just<00:04:36.479> going

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
then when that's done we're just going

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.430 
then when that's done we're just going
to<00:04:36.660> lightly<00:04:37.070> fry<00:04:38.070> them<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.550> fry<00:04:38.760> pan<00:04:39.289> ok<00:04:40.289> now

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
to lightly fry them in a fry pan ok now

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.170 
to lightly fry them in a fry pan ok now
we're<00:04:40.500> ready<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.830> put<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.250> dumplings<00:04:41.880> in

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
we're ready to put the dumplings in

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.409 
we're ready to put the dumplings in
boiling<00:04:42.660> water<00:04:42.690> here<00:04:43.289> so<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.330> a

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
boiling water here so this is it a

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.930 
boiling water here so this is it a
roiling<00:04:45.840> boil<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.979> guess

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.610 

we've<00:04:50.510> got<00:04:50.660> some<00:04:50.840> rockin<00:04:51.230> music<00:04:51.620> going

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.400 

so<00:04:56.990> you're<00:04:57.990> hell-bent<00:04:58.169> for<00:04:58.470> dumplings<00:05:00.410> all

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so you're hell-bent for dumplings all

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.370 
so you're hell-bent for dumplings all
right<00:05:01.620> now<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.889> dumplings<00:05:02.490> are<00:05:02.870> then<00:05:03.870> boiling

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
right now the dumplings are then boiling

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.020 
right now the dumplings are then boiling
for<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> nice<00:05:04.860> full<00:05:05.130> minute<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.699> now<00:05:05.880> we're

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
for a nice full minute so now we're

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.480 
for a nice full minute so now we're
going<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> put<00:05:07.370> them<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> fry<00:05:08.850> pan<00:05:10.490> there
