I don't know I just I kind of didn't
understand<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> point<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.200> guess<00:01:43.439> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
understand the point but I guess for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.109 
understand the point but I guess for
detail<00:01:44.070> purposes<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:44.759> pretty<00:01:44.909> cool

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
detail purposes it looks pretty cool

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.819 
detail purposes it looks pretty cool
they<00:01:45.600> tell<00:01:45.899> me<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> enough<00:01:46.619> time

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
they tell me that they have enough time

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
they tell me that they have enough time
on<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:47.130> hands<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> sit<00:01:47.610> around<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.450> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
on their hands to sit around and do this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539 
on their hands to sit around and do this
so<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.920> enough<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.250> their<00:01:50.430> hands

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
so they have enough time on their hands

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.440 
so they have enough time on their hands
that<00:01:50.670> sit<00:01:50.790> around<00:01:50.880> can't<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that sit around can't they make a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270 
that sit around can't they make a

they<00:02:43.980> would<00:02:44.130> make<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.460> similar<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.720> round

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
5 situation where they did theirs I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090 
5 situation where they did theirs I
think<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.960> could<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.260> good<00:02:49.410> seller<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:49.890> as

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
