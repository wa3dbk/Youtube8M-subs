actually<00:01:52.080> I've<00:01:52.289> always<00:01:52.590> enjoyed<00:01:52.910> this<00:01:53.910> story

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
actually I've always enjoyed this story

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.449 
actually I've always enjoyed this story
it's<00:01:54.420> well<00:01:55.259> maybe<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.830> odd<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.310> is

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
it's well maybe it's odd but this is

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.999 
it's well maybe it's odd but this is
probably<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.819> favorite<00:01:57.179> of<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.420> season<00:01:58.009> so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
probably my favorite of that season so

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
probably my favorite of that season so
this<00:01:59.580> shows<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.789> Paul<00:02:00.569> who<00:02:00.989> fandom<00:02:01.470> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this shows that Paul who fandom is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.619 
this shows that Paul who fandom is
completely<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.459> agreement<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:03.629 
completely in agreement on what are the

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.199 
completely in agreement on what are the
best<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.440> worst<00:02:04.590> stories<00:02:05.209> in

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
best in what are the worst stories in

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.029 
best in what are the worst stories in
fact<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> original<00:02:07.530> series<00:02:07.709> I<00:02:07.860> don't

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
fact for the original series I don't

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.139 
fact for the original series I don't
think<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.340> any<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.670> were<00:02:08.789> horribly

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
think there are any that were horribly

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.949 
think there are any that were horribly
bad<00:02:10.039> well<00:02:11.039> maybe<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.520> from<00:02:11.700> season<00:02:12.000> 24<00:02:12.569> comes

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
bad well maybe some from season 24 comes

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.050 
bad well maybe some from season 24 comes
close<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:14.340> another<00:02:14.879> video

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
close but that's another video

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.910 
close but that's another video
altogether<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.800> anyways<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.530> also<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
altogether so anyways this is also the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.430 
altogether so anyways this is also the
story<00:02:20.190> where<00:02:20.459> Tom<00:02:20.910> Baker's<00:02:21.270> doctor<00:02:21.660> spends

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
half of it as a cactus and I'll take

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.699 
half of it as a cactus and I'll take
another<00:02:26.819> quick<00:02:27.450> look<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.590> have

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
another quick look here and see we have

another quick look here and see we have
because<00:02:28.950> once<00:02:29.550> again<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.230> didn't<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.260> have

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
because once again I didn't really have

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.780 
because once again I didn't really have
much<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.040> chance<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> look<00:02:32.610> at<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
much of a chance to take a look at the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.330 
much of a chance to take a look at the

out<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:36.540> we've<00:02:36.750> got<00:02:37.019> our<00:02:37.230> typical<00:02:38.099> audio

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700

out but we've got our typical audio
commentary<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.450> have

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
commentary and then we have

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.559 
commentary and then we have
our<00:02:43.260> documentary<00:02:44.790> necklace<00:02:45.790> men<00:02:46.060> 18<00:02:47.049> minutes

passed away back in 2007 and it's I

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.420 
passed away back in 2007 and it's I
guess<00:03:21.699> it's<00:03:21.849> kind<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> odd<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.239> they<00:03:22.599> do<00:03:22.659> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
guess it's kind of odd that they do a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.589 
guess it's kind of odd that they do a

be<00:04:05.560> animating<00:04:06.099> that<00:04:06.189> or<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:06.579> they're<00:04:06.759> doing

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
be animating that or what they're doing

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.330 
be animating that or what they're doing
but<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.079> one<00:04:08.199> will<00:04:08.349> probably<00:04:08.949> see<00:04:09.220> an

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
but that one will probably see an

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the end of the release cycle so here we

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.349 
the end of the release cycle so here we
go<00:04:16.900> one<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.470> remaining<00:04:17.919> stories<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.789> guess

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
go one of the remaining stories I guess

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.330 
go one of the remaining stories I guess
in<00:04:19.630> concert<00:04:20.019> with<00:04:20.049> my<00:04:20.259> closest<00:04:20.650> one<00:04:20.799> tends<00:04:21.159> not

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
in concert with my closest one tends not

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.950 
in concert with my closest one tends not
to<00:04:21.549> be<00:04:21.699> one<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.090> more<00:04:22.180> highly<00:04:22.509> regarded

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
to be one of the more highly regarded

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.339 
to be one of the more highly regarded
but<00:04:24.000> over<00:04:25.000> time<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.449> Trump<00:04:25.719> and<00:04:25.870> Arras

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
but over time the Trump and Arras

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.909 
but over time the Trump and Arras
actually<00:04:26.680> probably<00:04:26.949> become<00:04:27.190> my<00:04:27.340> favorite<00:04:28.919> of

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
actually probably become my favorite of

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.620 
actually probably become my favorite of
all<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.219> doctors<00:04:30.550> mainly<00:04:30.969> because<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.360> didn't

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
all the doctors mainly because I didn't

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.969 
all the doctors mainly because I didn't
watch<00:04:31.930> them<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.229> lot<00:04:32.409> when<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:32.680> around

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979

originally except for the mind robber so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.089 
originally except for the mind robber so
it's<00:04:36.280> nice<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.300> see<00:04:37.630> some<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.020> these<00:04:38.110> for<00:04:38.979> the
