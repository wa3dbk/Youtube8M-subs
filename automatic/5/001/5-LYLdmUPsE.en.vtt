is of course a rematch of last year's
french<00:00:10.260> open<00:00:10.620> final<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.340> Roger<00:00:11.580> took<00:00:11.910> in

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
french open final that Roger took in

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.690 
french open final that Roger took in
straight<00:00:12.540> sets<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:14.099> match<00:00:14.370> obviously

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
straight sets now this match obviously

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.029 
straight sets now this match obviously
highly<00:00:15.150> anticipated<00:00:15.990> maybe<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> most<00:00:16.619> highly

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
highly anticipated maybe the most highly

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.650 
highly anticipated maybe the most highly
anticipated<00:00:17.160> match<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.119> tournament<00:00:18.150> thus

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
anticipated match of the tournament thus

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
anticipated match of the tournament thus
far<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:19.800> ultimately<00:00:20.359> what<00:00:21.359> this

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
far and I think ultimately what this

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
far and I think ultimately what this
match<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> come<00:00:22.350> down<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
match is going to come down to is the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
match is going to come down to is the
backhand<00:00:24.570> exchanges<00:00:25.170> between<00:00:25.289> federer<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
backhand exchanges between federer and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
backhand exchanges between federer and
soderling<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> durling<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> course<00:00:27.779> has<00:00:27.960> never

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
soderling so durling of course has never

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
soderling so durling of course has never
beaten<00:00:28.650> Federer<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.519> an<00:00:30.119> ATP<00:00:30.630> match<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.080> won

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
beaten Federer in an ATP match you won

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.740 
beaten Federer in an ATP match you won
an<00:00:31.439> exhibition<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> same<00:00:32.669> thing

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
an exhibition that's not the same thing

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
an exhibition that's not the same thing
so<00:00:33.750> Federer<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.700> good<00:00:35.969> winning

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so Federer has a really good winning

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
so Federer has a really good winning
record<00:00:36.660> against<00:00:37.020> him<00:00:37.200> they've<00:00:37.350> played

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
record against him they've played

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
record against him they've played
somewhere<00:00:38.280> around<00:00:38.340> 13<00:00:38.910> times<00:00:39.239> Federer's<00:00:39.989> won

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
somewhere around 13 times Federer's won

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.840 
somewhere around 13 times Federer's won
all<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.739> he's<00:00:41.100> won<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> lot<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> them

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
all of them he's won a lot of them

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.500 
all of them he's won a lot of them
relatively<00:00:42.690> handily<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.730> sort<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> link

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
relatively handily now what sort of link

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
relatively handily now what sort of link
what<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.320> darling<00:00:46.469> needs<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.129> when

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
what I think so darling needs to do when

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
what I think so darling needs to do when
we<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:47.969> backhand<00:00:48.570> exchanges<00:00:49.110> remember

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
we get these backhand exchanges remember

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
we get these backhand exchanges remember
circles<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> player<00:00:50.100> stick<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> side

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
circles the player stick the side

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
circles the player stick the side
they're<00:00:51.329> hitting<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.170> righties

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
they're hitting on this is a righties

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're hitting on this is a righties
back<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.870> these

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
back in you're going to get these

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.529 
back in you're going to get these
backhand<00:00:55.590> exchanges<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.210> darling<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
backhand exchanges and so darling is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
backhand exchanges and so darling is
going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.430> with<00:00:59.430> his

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
going to have to be on point with his

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
going to have to be on point with his
placement<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:01.050> needs<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.530> most<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
placement he needs to keep most of the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
placement he needs to keep most of the
balls<00:01:02.370> over<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.570> area<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.170> court<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
balls over in this area the court and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
balls over in this area the court and
the<00:01:05.460> idea<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.240> prevent<00:01:06.869> Federer<00:01:07.680> from

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the idea is to prevent Federer from

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
the idea is to prevent Federer from
running<00:01:08.369> around<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> his<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.780> ends

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
running around a lot of his back ends

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
running around a lot of his back ends
now<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.310> darling<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> course<00:01:11.729> likes<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
now so darling of course likes to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
now so darling of course likes to
control<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> rallies<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.400> his

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
control a lot of rallies with his

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
control a lot of rallies with his
forehand<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.170> maybe

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
forehand so you would think that maybe

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.550 
forehand so you would think that maybe
so<00:01:17.729> dling<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.210> looking<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> area<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so dling is looking for this area of the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
so dling is looking for this area of the
court<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.130> his<00:01:20.280> forehand<00:01:20.930> which<00:01:21.930> means

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
court to be on his forehand which means

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
court to be on his forehand which means
he<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.220> hitting<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> lot<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> inside<00:01:24.240> out

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
he would be hitting a lot of inside out

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
he would be hitting a lot of inside out
for<00:01:24.720> hands<00:01:24.930> that's<00:01:25.140> certainly<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.560> he's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
for hands that's certainly what he's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
for hands that's certainly what he's
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.009> looking<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.360> he<00:01:27.509> needs

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to be looking to do but he needs

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to be looking to do but he needs
to<00:01:27.750> prevent<00:01:28.140> Federer<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.890> doing<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> same

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to prevent Federer from doing the same

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.690 
to prevent Federer from doing the same
thing<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> him<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.810> put<00:01:30.990> feds<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.369> hand

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
thing to him so if we put feds for hand

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
thing to him so if we put feds for hand
up<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> area<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> court

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
up here this is the area the court

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
up here this is the area the court
Federer<00:01:35.310> wants<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> control<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
Federer wants to control it's going to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

don't think too many for hand to
forehand<00:01:46.500> exchanges<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
forehand exchanges like this

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.090 
forehand exchanges like this
particularly<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.890> suddenly

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100

he's got a great forehand but it's not
Federer's<00:01:52.290> forehand<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> best

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
Federer's forehand I think it's the best

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.630

taking huge cuts at the ball now if the
court<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.639> slower<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.900> dueling's<00:03:33.199> going<00:03:33.319> to

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
court is slower so dueling's going to

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.500

ball and be prepared to hit with his his

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.159 
ball and be prepared to hit with his his
longer<00:03:39.650> mechanics<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:41.299> fought<00:03:41.689> against

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
longer mechanics and I fought against

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.509 
longer mechanics and I fought against
wall<00:03:42.379> wrinkle<00:03:42.799> when<00:03:42.889> Federer<00:03:43.189> was<00:03:43.310> playing

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
wall wrinkle when Federer was playing

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.789 
wall wrinkle when Federer was playing
while<00:03:43.669> rinka<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> other<00:03:44.269> day<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:45.590> know<00:03:45.650> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
while rinka the other day you know the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.289 
while rinka the other day you know the
conditions<00:03:46.189> weren't<00:03:46.370> great<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:47.030> thought

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
conditions weren't great and I thought

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.289 
conditions weren't great and I thought
on<00:03:47.780> occasion<00:03:48.500> Federer's<00:03:48.919> backhand<00:03:49.519> wasn't

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
on occasion Federer's backhand wasn't

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.689 
on occasion Federer's backhand wasn't
really<00:03:50.540> penetrating<00:03:51.199> the<00:03:51.290> court<00:03:51.560> too<00:03:51.739> much<00:03:51.979> so

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
really penetrating the court too much so

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.939 
really penetrating the court too much so
if<00:03:53.150> soloing<00:03:53.720> runs<00:03:53.930> into<00:03:54.169> a<00:03:54.199> situation<00:03:54.439> like

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
if soloing runs into a situation like

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.830 
if soloing runs into a situation like
that<00:03:55.009> where<00:03:55.250> Federer<00:03:55.790> isn't<00:03:56.540> getting<00:03:56.689> his

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that where Federer isn't getting his

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.509 
that where Federer isn't getting his
backhand<00:03:57.319> as<00:03:57.500> deep<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.859> he<00:03:57.949> wants<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.400> then

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
backhand as deep as he wants and then

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.249 
backhand as deep as he wants and then
the<00:03:58.579> court<00:03:58.879> is<00:03:59.030> really<00:03:59.569> slow<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.079> ball

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:00.259 
the court is really slow in the ball

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.530 
the court is really slow in the ball
down<00:04:00.560> that's<00:04:01.370> going<00:04:01.699> to<00:04:01.759> give<00:04:01.909> certainly<00:04:02.419> an

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
down that's going to give certainly an

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.689 
down that's going to give certainly an
opportunity<00:04:03.229> to<00:04:03.709> run<00:04:03.919> around<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.340> lot<00:04:04.489> of<00:04:04.639> these

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
opportunity to run around a lot of these

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.089 
opportunity to run around a lot of these
groundstrokes<00:04:05.329> totaling<00:04:06.169> of<00:04:06.290> course<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.739> a

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
groundstrokes totaling of course is a

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.240 
groundstrokes totaling of course is a
big<00:04:07.370> strong<00:04:07.639> guy<00:04:07.669> he<00:04:08.090> hits<00:04:08.299> real<00:04:08.959> hard<00:04:09.319> so<00:04:09.799> you

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
big strong guy he hits real hard so you

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.369 
big strong guy he hits real hard so you
suspect<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.759> so<00:04:11.449> dueling's<00:04:11.750> groundstrokes

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
suspect that so dueling's groundstrokes

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.649 
suspect that so dueling's groundstrokes
regardless<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.250> conditions<00:04:13.849> are<00:04:14.389> going

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
regardless of the conditions are going

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.110 
regardless of the conditions are going
to<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:14.840> pretty<00:04:15.139> penetrating<00:04:15.829> shots<00:04:16.099> and<00:04:16.459> if

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
to be pretty penetrating shots and if

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.999 
to be pretty penetrating shots and if
you<00:04:17.269> can<00:04:17.389> get<00:04:17.570> federal<00:04:17.840> lay<00:04:18.259> in<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.500> back<00:04:18.709> hand

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
you can get federal lay in the back hand

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.219 
you can get federal lay in the back hand
up<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.519> maybe<00:04:19.699> a<00:04:19.849> little<00:04:19.909> bit<00:04:20.269> short<00:04:20.570> that's

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
up and maybe a little bit short that's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.080 
up and maybe a little bit short that's
going<00:04:21.409> to<00:04:21.500> give<00:04:21.560> him<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:22.190> better<00:04:22.669> opportunity

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
going to give him a better opportunity

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.180 
going to give him a better opportunity
to<00:04:23.539> take<00:04:23.719> control<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.110> more<00:04:24.380> points<00:04:24.770> by

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
to take control of more points by

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.250 
to take control of more points by
running<00:04:25.520> around<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.820> back

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
running around the back

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.350 
running around the back
in<00:04:26.320> in<00:04:26.530> hitting<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:27.100> forehand<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.880> again

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
in in hitting a forehand so again

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.180 
in in hitting a forehand so again
Federer<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:29.140> dling<00:04:29.410> should<00:04:29.620> be<00:04:29.710> hoping<00:04:29.860> for

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
Federer so dling should be hoping for

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.100 
Federer so dling should be hoping for
rain<00:04:30.340> he<00:04:30.880> should<00:04:31.060> be<00:04:31.150> hoping<00:04:31.300> for<00:04:31.510> conditions

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
rain he should be hoping for conditions

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.300 
rain he should be hoping for conditions
that<00:04:32.230> are<00:04:32.260> really<00:04:32.500> going<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.680> slow<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.040> court

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
that are really going to slow the court

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.430 
that are really going to slow the court
down<00:04:33.520> because<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.540> will<00:04:34.720> give<00:04:34.900> him<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.200> better

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
down because that will give him a better

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.850 
down because that will give him a better
chance<00:04:35.830> of<00:04:36.100> being<00:04:36.240> set<00:04:37.240> up<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.650> give<00:04:38.650> him<00:04:38.770> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
chance of being set up and give him a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860 
chance of being set up and give him a
better<00:04:39.010> chance<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.460> taking<00:04:39.670> big<00:04:40.300> cuts<00:04:40.600> at<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
better chance of taking big cuts at the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.590 
better chance of taking big cuts at the
ball<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.380> match<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.800> course<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:43.120> tomorrow

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
ball so that match of course is tomorrow

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.970 
ball so that match of course is tomorrow
really<00:04:43.930> looking<00:04:44.170> forward<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.530> like<00:04:44.860> I
