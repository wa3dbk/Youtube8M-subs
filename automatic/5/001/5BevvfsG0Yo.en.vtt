00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.899
 here we are with the farm of the 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.340
 French itches hearts clovers and 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.530
 diamonds again to do the others 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.169
 games as always the classic of their 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 that I love we are going to put a 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.990
 little bit the farm as 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.280
 a little bit we both added in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.650
 speed 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.520
 well once mixed what we're going to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.100
 do is take a small group of letters we 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.130
 in the first four five from 1 to 6 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.930
 for example let's take them out and let's 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:42.579
 do something with them let's take out the 16 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.190
 by train from 30 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.019
 has to accuse me of these more boring 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.040
 but well I can not talk and take the 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:55.280
 letters you know yes no 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.280
 from 1 to 6 is state 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 this also as it is also 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.460
 this is also very good 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.030
 you are at the moment we are going to leave there and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.890
 let's play with these we're going to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 do good let's go good before we go to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 cut and complete to mix still 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 more and we're going to ask a viewer that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.829
 give us the stop when he wants when 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.039
 he wishes we are going to be throwing letters 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.680
 that's how it's worth the end 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:32.680
 throwing cards 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.470
 22 because it's not where you 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 and we collect the group of letters 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.000
 that has remained and we are going to mix them 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.150
 a little more or rather we are going to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 pull apart 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.030
 and acting the clearest and let's see 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.229
 the last two letters that have been left 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.170
 that they will be the selection that they will be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 these two and as you can see who 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 magical cause has this that sometimes 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.549
 happen these things are 27 yes but it's that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 besides that they affect the color and this 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.670
 because good maybe it's the game go 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.829
 guided by the magic of the seven not 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.739
 the sevens have left because I do not know 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.230
 let's try to do something else what 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.840
 same to the same viewer or another is that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
 want to withdraw when he wants 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 imagine initial tone there is in sure one 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.110
 there's one less let alone 7 and there 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.329
 the first 7 we are going to repeat them again 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.420
 we are going to throw cards and the special 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.190
 of spending there is another plus and more inside 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 then another one we put the 7 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.830
 and here what we have good then 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 we have 27 face up 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.770
 lost in this portion of the breasts by 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 the viewer as he has wanted where he has 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.550
 dear funny you feel to be face 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 above 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.420
 now letters the fact that faces with 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.030
 those 7 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.550
 we'll see 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.709
 here we go for example here we have the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.400
 first 7 with a letter that collides face 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.980
 And here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.920
 I was next 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.420
 you see another seven that touch with another face 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.860
 there is no marginalized letter 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.530
 simply to 27 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.760
 what letters were these then look what 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.700
 things have this that are us 27 the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.480
 Iberians so if we go well 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.480
 routed thinking that they are this game 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.150
 is the magic game of the sevens 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 Well, we are not going to attack the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.200
 luck and we're not going to end here we go 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 to take these letters that we had here 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.610
 if you remember that they were what we had 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 separated from 1 to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.140
 to 6 we were not going to mix them up like that 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.290
 bit 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.260
 and let's do one thing we're going to ask 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.940
 a spectator that of these 47 is chosen 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.440
 the two who want to give exactly the same 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.790
 because like the four of them it seems that 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.370
 they are richer it does not matter two movies 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.920
 machines that choose these two that we're going to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.180
 say lose it on the site of the of 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.310
 the deck where he wants, let's go 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.470
 separating letters and where he wants then 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.140
 decide himself and let's leave the 7 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 let's continue right there and let's leave 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.440
 in other systems 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.210
 and not with all this we are going to mix 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.660
 even more a little bit more just like 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.840
 loses more sevens in the portion of 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.930
 which deck do we have 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.270
 there we have to cut and complete 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.510
 and even because we can not go back to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.970
 cut and complete 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.730
 and now something similar happens to that of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.610
 before polo garcÃ­a not equal there is a 7 that 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.120
 is facing a letter but we're not going 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.770
 to look at that let's look at the sevens 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.639
 they have a letter above and one below 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.789
 they have two letters 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.780
 for the first 7 and the second 720 has 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.780
 a letter above and below 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.240
 and now let's see what happens what 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.390
 letters are these then a 5 and a 2 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.690
 13 and 14 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:17.330
 what a coincidence or what magic will be that 5 and 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:20.900
 2 add 7 4 and 3 because they also add 7 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:26.509
 and of course because any letter from the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.020
 these streets account total 72 and 33 and 255 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.340
 and about 6 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.009
 6 and 4 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.120
 9 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:39.360
 6 and 49 true 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.360
 It does not matter 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:48.050
 between 45 and 49 there is no letter in 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.550
 none of them add up to 7 but if 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.210
 you're because 'cause the sevens were 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.080
 magical and nothing this is the game of the 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.080
 seven magical lords
