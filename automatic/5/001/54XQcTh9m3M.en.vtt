00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
120 gigabyte version that we're looking

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
120 gigabyte version that we're looking
at<00:00:30.869> today<00:00:31.050> however<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.009> does<00:00:32.219> come<00:00:32.460> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
at today however it does come in

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.420 
at today however it does come in
different<00:00:32.759> sizes<00:00:33.710> these<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
different sizes these are the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
different sizes these are the
specifications<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.960> okay<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
specifications for it okay and it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
specifications for it okay and it's
basically<00:00:38.100> no<00:00:38.910> different<00:00:39.450> than<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
basically no different than the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.549 
basically no different than the
specifications<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.129> 2.5<00:00:41.430> inch<00:00:42.360> SSD<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
specifications from a 2.5 inch SSD to be

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
specifications from a 2.5 inch SSD to be
honest<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> look<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.850> truly

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
honest if you look at it these are truly

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
honest if you look at it these are truly
very<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.620> fast<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:48.020> obviously<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
very very fast and obviously what the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
very very fast and obviously what the
main<00:00:50.340> benefit<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.030> having<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> 3.5<00:00:51.899> inch<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
main benefit about having a 3.5 inch is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
main benefit about having a 3.5 inch is
not<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> fact<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> same

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
not just the fact that it has the same

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.260 
not just the fact that it has the same
stats<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.070> also<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> install<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
stats but also when you install it in

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
stats but also when you install it in
your<00:00:57.300> desktop<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.920> need<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
your desktop you will not need the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
your desktop you will not need the
bracket<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> box<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.980> get

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
bracket right so in the box all you get

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
bracket right so in the box all you get
is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> manual<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.899> screws

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is the manual that's it and the screws

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
is the manual that's it and the screws
so<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.650> attach<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.170> because

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so you can attach it on the side because

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.160 
so you can attach it on the side because
of<00:01:07.409> its<00:01:08.040> width<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.510> fits<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:10.020> no

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of its width it just fits in there no

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.460 
of its width it just fits in there no
problem<00:01:10.560> okay<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
problem okay so there you go there's the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
problem okay so there you go there's the
SSD<00:01:13.979> itself<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:14.729> lightweight<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.840> heavy<00:01:16.170> at

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
SSD itself very lightweight not heavy at

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.090 
SSD itself very lightweight not heavy at
all<00:01:16.850> it's<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.060> slick<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.439> construction

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
all it's pretty slick the construction

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.140 
all it's pretty slick the construction
there<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.979> well<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.280> easy<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> install<00:01:23.909> like

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there and well very easy to install like

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
there and well very easy to install like
I<00:01:24.180> said<00:01:24.479> no<00:01:24.630> bracket<00:01:25.080> needed<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.799> that's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I said no bracket needed so that's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.359 
I said no bracket needed so that's
pretty<00:01:26.189> straightforward<00:01:26.720> from<00:01:27.720> occ<00:01:28.590> these

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
pretty straightforward from occ these

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.330 
pretty straightforward from occ these
SSD<00:01:30.180> drives<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
SSD drives are really the way of the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.810 
SSD drives are really the way of the
future<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.970> solid-state<00:01:33.689> no<00:01:34.259> moving<00:01:34.530> parts

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
future right solid-state no moving parts

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
future right solid-state no moving parts
just<00:01:35.820> basically<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.229> SATA<00:01:37.500> connectors<00:01:38.400> there

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
just basically the SATA connectors there

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.840 
just basically the SATA connectors there
at<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> back<00:01:38.970> plug<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.220> format<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> where

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
at the back plug it in format it where

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
at the back plug it in format it where
you<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.390> even<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> defrag

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you go you don't even have to defrag

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
you go you don't even have to defrag
these<00:01:43.560> drives<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.180> everything<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.600> taken

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
these drives right everything is taken

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
these drives right everything is taken
care<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.159> test<00:01:47.460> system<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> will

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
care of here is my test system that will

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.139 
care of here is my test system that will
be<00:01:48.450> using<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.000> we're<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be using this in and we're going to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.450 
be using this in and we're going to
start<00:01:51.329> off<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:51.600> benchmarks<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.040> course

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
start off some benchmarks with of course

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
start off some benchmarks with of course
the<00:01:54.270> addo<00:01:54.540> disk<00:01:55.020> benchmark<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.860> that's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the addo disk benchmark because that's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.550 
the addo disk benchmark because that's
going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.399> give<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:57.000> an<00:01:57.240> idea<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.170> it's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
going to really give us an idea if it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830 
going to really give us an idea if it's
meeting<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.520> specifications<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> drive

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
meeting the specifications of the drive

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719 
meeting the specifications of the drive
when<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> comes<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> read<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.490> right

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
when it comes to the read and the right

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.630 
when it comes to the read and the right
so<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> results<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.219> we're

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so if we look at the results here we're

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
so if we look at the results here we're
getting<00:02:05.820> about<00:02:07.459> 250<00:02:08.569> 558

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
getting about 250 558

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.500 
getting about 250 558
per<00:02:10.680> second<00:02:11.070> on<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> read

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
per second on the right and on the read

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.190
