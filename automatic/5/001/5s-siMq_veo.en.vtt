is glazed the clutch is located on your
scooter<00:00:12.799> right<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.360> this<00:00:15.360> one's<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> little

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
scooter right here this one's a little

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
scooter right here this one's a little
different<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:16.470> talking<00:00:16.770> about<00:00:16.800> gy6<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.789> this

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
different I'm talking about gy6 and this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
different I'm talking about gy6 and this
is<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> two-stroke<00:00:18.570> jog<00:00:19.020> motor<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
is a two-stroke jog motor so it's a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.420 
is a two-stroke jog motor so it's a
little<00:00:19.830> different<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.980> here's<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> gy6

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
little different but I here's a gy6

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.330 
little different but I here's a gy6
engine<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> kick<00:00:25.619> start<00:00:25.920> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
engine you know it's a kick start you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.589 
engine you know it's a kick start you
pull<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> cover<00:00:26.849> off<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
pull this cover off and then you get to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.460 
pull this cover off and then you get to
all<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.429> but<00:00:29.429> anyway<00:00:29.960> if<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.170> scooter

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
all that but anyway if your scooter

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
all that but anyway if your scooter
squeaks<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.420> inside<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
squeaks it's because the the inside of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
squeaks it's because the the inside of
this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.930> glazed<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:35.160> glazes<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.760> like

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
this is glazed it glazes just like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.819 
this is glazed it glazes just like
brakes<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> solution<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
brakes do and the solution to that is

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.080 
brakes do and the solution to that is
get<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> performance<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> reason<00:00:41.910> why<00:00:42.030> these

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
get a performance the reason why these

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
get a performance the reason why these
are<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:42.420> different<00:00:42.660> sizes<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.290> all

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
are two different sizes first of all

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.380 
are two different sizes first of all
this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.590> 50<00:00:43.890> cc<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.430> two<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> these

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this is 50 cc these two are and these

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.680 
this is 50 cc these two are and these
are<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.660> 150<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> didn't<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.210> any<00:00:48.450> old

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
are for 150 but I didn't have any old

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.200 
are for 150 but I didn't have any old
150<00:00:49.440> cc<00:00:50.120> parts<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> 50<00:00:53.070> cc

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
150 cc parts so you get to see a 50 cc

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
150 cc parts so you get to see a 50 cc
but<00:00:54.210> anyway<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.600> you're<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but anyway if you're if you have a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.229 
but anyway if you're if you have a
glazed<00:00:57.469> clutch<00:00:58.469> hub<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.670> squeak<00:01:00.059> when

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
glazed clutch hub it's gonna squeak when

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
glazed clutch hub it's gonna squeak when
it<00:01:00.329> takes<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> give<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it takes off when you go to give it the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
it takes off when you go to give it the
gas<00:01:01.770> initially<00:01:02.430> it'll<00:01:02.550> squeak<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.870> solution

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
gas initially it'll squeak the solution

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
gas initially it'll squeak the solution
is<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.570> aftermarket<00:01:06.570> performance

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
is to get a aftermarket performance

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.070 
is to get a aftermarket performance
clutch<00:01:07.740> hub<00:01:08.270> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> notice<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:09.840> holes

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
clutch hub if you notice there's holes

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
clutch hub if you notice there's holes
drilled<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:14.000> unlike<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.270> standard

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
drilled in it see that unlike a standard

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.399 
drilled in it see that unlike a standard
one<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.360> helps<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.960> helps<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
one and it helps with it helps with the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.969 
one and it helps with it helps with the
gripping<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> clutch<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:21.479> it
