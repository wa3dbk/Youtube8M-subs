the last thing we will do is tie in our

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.390 
the last thing we will do is tie in our
partridge<00:03:54.780> soft<00:03:55.200> tackle<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.129> I<00:03:56.189> take<00:03:56.340> a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
partridge soft tackle so I take a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.360 
partridge soft tackle so I take a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
partridge feather sweep back most of the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.940 
partridge feather sweep back most of the
legs<00:04:02.609> exposing<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.689> tip<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.560> tie-in

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
legs exposing just the tip as a tie-in

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.929 
legs exposing just the tip as a tie-in
point<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.090> it'll<00:04:06.680> look<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.040> just<00:04:08.730> like

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
point so it'll look like that just like

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.059 
point so it'll look like that just like
any<00:04:09.090> other<00:04:09.180> soft<00:04:09.930> tackle<00:04:10.349> or<00:04:10.469> partridge<00:04:10.859> legs

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069

feathers sort of sweeps back this way

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.670 
feathers sort of sweeps back this way
and<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.150> my<00:04:18.180> fiber<00:04:18.479> sweeping<00:04:19.109> backs<00:04:19.320> off

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
and I want my fiber sweeping backs off

and I want my fiber sweeping backs off
tackle<00:04:19.919> style<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.489> I'll<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.609> tie<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.650> with

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
tackle style so I'll just tie it in with

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.360 
tackle style so I'll just tie it in with
the<00:04:23.310> curve<00:04:23.669> against<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.660> hook<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:25.310> couple<00:04:26.310> of

take<00:04:31.289> my<00:04:31.440> feather<00:04:31.740> sweep<00:04:32.280> sweep<00:04:32.760> these<00:04:32.970> fibers

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
take my feather sweep sweep these fibers

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.180 
take my feather sweep sweep these fibers
