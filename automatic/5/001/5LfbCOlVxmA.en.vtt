00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.720
 the car is a discipline for 100 nuevos soles and pinamar people 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:15.229
 what to work fundamentally to be 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 development of human potential 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.019
 civil 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.640
 for 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.259
 accompany the transit 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.230
 to say it somehow between 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.640
 what we are 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.510
 getting our what to do in our practice in our performance 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.339
 current 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.650
 and what we want to win then 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.230
 The car has 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.560
 a set of say distinctions and skills for 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 help the person 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.340
 for example look 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.640
 this situation from other perspectives 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.920
 and what we know is that when we look at different things 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.150
 We could percent do things that were not transported before in our menu 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 options 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.830
 well out there different questions that people now had not 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.000
 formulated 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.020
 yes manages to power is to connect people with their own answers with 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.330
 their own potentialities percent with their own capacity for action to 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.890
 solve that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.840
 is committed to eta prisoners and for now the problem was posed 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.790
 for the others we propose that all that person 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 what rc the driving function 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.780
 from the leadership 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.109
 must have to incorporate the competencies of ccoo 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 because why one of the responsibilities 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.170
 d the one who leads the leadership 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.530
 is to work for the development 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.610
 d 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.710
 of your people zertuche for that you need 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 this competition the chancellor indicated 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 there are different approaches within the couch inti 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.960
 we 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.969
 we take as he says 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.089
 the different concepts and tools visits 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.409
 to build our 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.409
 our conceptual body what in an amazing way 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.679
 for example an idea of ​​the model called anthology language 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.319
 in neurolinguistic programming 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.109
 of humanistic psychology 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.679
 vila 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.679
 emotional intelligence 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.719
 increasingly 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
 the current world competitive markets 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.230
 percent and pressuring businesses and people 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.619
 to a continuous change 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.079
 and the continuous change implies a permanent learning and swimming 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.769
 and then at the moment so much the organizational change 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.139
 as personal transformation 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.139
 2 dimensions that are absolutely rational 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.310
 d in that place 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.479
 the continent 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 I went to accompany these processes of change and the press 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.469
 I would say that there are great interests motivations 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.599
 what are you mining for 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.739
 the first time 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.409
 the person who want to train to exercise copper professionally 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.599
 there are also people who do not want to do things but do 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.849
 p 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.709
 roles and responsibilities of driving as they own the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.500
 company 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.809
 or they have managerial levels they returned work team 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:37.359
 and clearly perceive who decides to incorporate other skills and 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.930
 competences of the degree of communication 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.259
 the link of the theme of mocionar and adopt 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.799
 Professional or Nativity 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.009
 but in your practice 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.759
 labor the need for rivers 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:57.009
 well do this kind of formations 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.420
 and there is a third motivation that is 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.629
 the subject of personal development 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.149
 many times these three motivations &amp; totally irrational 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.049
 that someone who drives from chop has several responsibilities or 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.679
 basic behaviors 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.919
 once 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.989
 percent and build a shared vision with your people 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.159
 define where you are going 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.940
 how will you work with your people and with what values ​​that make up your castle 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.940
 to achieve these objectives 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.999
 a comment behavior 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.650
 percent and bind power transfer 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.559
 when telling the task is controllable 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.959
 today we think that we must reach power and generate responsibility 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.430
 a third time generate 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.400
 synergy and team spirit 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.999
 there is no leadership without team work and there is no team worked without life 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.770
 with two international mentions 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.879
 a fourth has to do with this we have been talking about him the car 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.020
 engage 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.199
 in the development and facilitation of that development 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.409
 the team person 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.639
 therefore there we said 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.409
 dictates the competencies of the ccoo leader 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.300
 and a store 5th behavior 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 us a window however the emotional 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.360
 about which we understand that emotion 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.409
 it is a conditioner 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.499
 d the behaviors and therefore 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.589
 any work team 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.289
 you are conditioned by group emotionality and the leader is someone who has 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.400
 what to generate 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.690
 and enthusiasm and commitment to make the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.690
 things can happen 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.189
 for us human communication 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.339
 It is a strategic tool 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.289
 why 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.409
 because we start from the base that 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.930
 the great amount of things that we do 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.389
 We have talked to them professionally on a daily basis 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.189
 other 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.379
 Thus 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.050
 the effectiveness of our work estrada 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.050
 largely conditioned by the quality of our comparsas 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.449
 from that place we 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.839
 we raise 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.930
 the acquisition of what we call conversation skills 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.930
 talk with being able to listen in depth 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.639
 inquire how this day 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.279
 get in tune to generate a quality bond my trust 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.150
 and talk in a productive way and see with the attitude that is 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.659
 that we assume in front 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.689
 to dialogue with
