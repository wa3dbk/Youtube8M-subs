eight<00:03:32.989> people<00:03:33.140> have<00:03:33.350> made<00:03:33.500> their<00:03:33.680> choice

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
eight people have made their choice

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.100 
eight people have made their choice
together<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.269> we<00:03:35.390> make<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.660> choice<00:03:35.870> in

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
together and so we make that choice in

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.870 
together and so we make that choice in
the<00:03:36.200> queue<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.709> choice<00:03:37.400> relates

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
the queue and that choice relates

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.729 
the queue and that choice relates
primarily<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.450> intensity<00:03:39.049> level<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.530> ride

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
primarily to intensity level of ride

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.340 
primarily to intensity level of ride
experience<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.299> that's<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.019> really<00:03:42.230> has

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
experience so that's and that really has

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.960 
experience so that's and that really has
a<00:03:42.380> lot<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.620> do<00:03:42.829> with<00:03:42.860> personal<00:03:43.310> choice<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.820> what

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
a lot to do with personal choice of what

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.550 
a lot to do with personal choice of what
out<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.360> know<00:03:44.600> how<00:03:44.959> do<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.140> want<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.410> feel

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
out you know how do I want to feel

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.199 
out you know how do I want to feel
during<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.980> ride<00:03:46.160> but<00:03:46.430> also<00:03:46.549> some<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.030> its

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
during the ride but also some of its

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.270 
during the ride but also some of its
ride<00:03:47.780> height<00:03:48.019> restriction<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.709> some<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.160> it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
ride height restriction and some of it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.340 
ride height restriction and some of it
is<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.519> ride<00:03:50.120> abilities<00:03:50.600> etc<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.170> it's

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
is like ride abilities etc so it's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.600 
is like ride abilities etc so it's
really<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.560> personal<00:03:51.769> choice<00:03:52.130> what<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.459> want

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
really a personal choice what you want

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.000 
really a personal choice what you want
to<00:03:52.700> do<00:03:52.790> but<00:03:53.420> even<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:53.780> my<00:03:53.930> family<00:03:54.380> chooses<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
to do but even if my family chooses to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.979 
to do but even if my family chooses to
do<00:03:55.130> intense<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.940> what<00:03:56.390> we'll<00:03:56.480> call<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.810> non

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
do intense and what we'll call the non

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.330 
do intense and what we'll call the non
intense<00:03:57.350> ride<00:03:57.560> that's<00:03:57.799> not<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.010> real<00:03:58.160> works

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
intense ride that's not the real works

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.699 
intense ride that's not the real works
but<00:03:58.700> we'll<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.060> use<00:03:59.150> those<00:03:59.299> for<00:03:59.480> today

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
but we'll just use those for today

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.110 
but we'll just use those for today
they'll<00:04:00.709> still<00:04:00.920> ride<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.549> experience

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
they'll still ride and experience

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.850 
they'll still ride and experience
Antarctic<00:04:02.600> together<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:03.440> may<00:04:03.620> be<00:04:03.680> in

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
Antarctic together they may be in

Antarctic together they may be in
different<00:04:04.070> vehicles<00:04:04.670> but<00:04:04.970> they'll<00:04:05.120> be<00:04:05.209> doing

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
different vehicles but they'll be doing

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
they'll experience inside the right

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.780 
they'll experience inside the right
what's<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.260> vehicle<00:04:12.620> gonna<00:04:12.769> do<00:04:12.980> well<00:04:13.640> this

what's the vehicle gonna do well this
vehicle<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:15.019> powerhouse<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.970> know<00:04:17.060> it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
vehicle is a powerhouse we you know it

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.420 
vehicle is a powerhouse we you know it
can<00:04:17.390> do<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.780> lot<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.229> things<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.739> it's<00:04:18.919> actually

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
can do a lot of things and it's actually

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.800 
can do a lot of things and it's actually
showing<00:04:19.820> us<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.180> can<00:04:20.269> do<00:04:20.359> more<00:04:20.539> than<00:04:20.690> we

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
showing us that it can do more than we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.409 
showing us that it can do more than we
thought<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.169> could<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:22.520> allows<00:04:22.820> us<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.240> have

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
thought it could do it allows us to have

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.930 
thought it could do it allows us to have
movements<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.289> ride<00:04:24.740> dynamics<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.610> I've

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
movements and ride dynamics that I've

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.700 
movements and ride dynamics that I've
never<00:04:26.180> felt<00:04:26.450> before<00:04:26.660> any<00:04:27.140> theme<00:04:27.440> park

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
never felt before any theme park

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.480 
never felt before any theme park
attraction<00:04:28.630> our<00:04:29.630> journey<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.380> alongside<00:04:30.919> and

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
attraction our journey is alongside and

with a very special penguin and his fan
we'll<00:04:34.490> talk<00:04:34.700> about<00:04:34.820> him<00:04:35.060> later<00:04:35.270> not<00:04:35.570> today<00:04:35.690> but

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
we'll talk about him later not today but

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.140 
we'll talk about him later not today but
we'll<00:04:36.710> take<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.010> journey<00:04:37.160> with<00:04:37.460> him<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:37.880> we

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
we'll take that journey with him and we

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.450 
we'll take that journey with him and we
see<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.540> world<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.930> Antarctica<00:04:39.560> as<00:04:39.710> only<00:04:40.220> he

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
see the world of Antarctica as only he

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.580 
see the world of Antarctica as only he
sees<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.940> through<00:04:41.330> his<00:04:41.540> eyes<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.110> sometimes

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
sees it through his eyes and sometimes

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.580 
sees it through his eyes and sometimes
it's<00:04:43.430> recognizable<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.330> us<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.750> sometimes<00:04:45.290> it

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
it's recognizable to us and sometimes it

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.740 
it's recognizable to us and sometimes it
will<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.890> brand-new<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.550> our<00:04:46.820> guests<00:04:47.270> because

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
will be brand-new to our guests because

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.870 
will be brand-new to our guests because
this<00:04:47.960> world<00:04:48.200> as<00:04:48.500> he<00:04:48.710> sees<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.250> not<00:04:49.640> how<00:04:49.820> we

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
this world as he sees it is not how we

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000 
this world as he sees it is not how we
humans<00:04:50.360> see<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.350> we'll<00:04:51.530> go<00:04:51.620> on<00:04:51.770> to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
humans see it and so we'll go on to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.530 
humans see it and so we'll go on to
venture<00:04:52.310> with<00:04:52.460> them<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.880> we'll<00:04:53.120> be<00:04:53.270> all<00:04:53.510> over

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
venture with them and we'll be all over

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.780 
venture with them and we'll be all over
the<00:04:53.840> place<00:04:53.930> with<00:04:54.230> him<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.590> this<00:04:55.040> ride<00:04:55.280> vehicle

the place with him and this ride vehicle

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.090 
the place with him and this ride vehicle
enables<00:04:56.420> us<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.720> tell<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.290> story<00:04:57.470> without

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
enables us to tell that story without

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.880 
enables us to tell that story without

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
awful things we typically have to deal
