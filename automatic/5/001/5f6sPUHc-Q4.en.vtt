00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.580
 when the best of the ways in which I 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 would have liked to get this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 rating we had done very matches 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.410
 solids 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.960
 during the whole group stage today not 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.840
 it was a good game we did not play well not 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.940
 We were intense, we did not generate much 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.980
 football on the offensive but obviously 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.309
 with positive results it is easier 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:44.170
 correct now you have to do an analysis 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.750
 thoroughly deep all and there are prepare us 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.199
 for whatever our junction with media 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.940
 even though the cup just started 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.610
 very little ago, we must 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.619
 get used to playing like Europeans 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.180
 two parties or three up per week not 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.920
 every eight days they play like this 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.250
 I think that the most important thing is what 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.250
 just said 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.500
 today and I should not be so severe with the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 evaluation that I will make of this group that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 is when the cup but today we do not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.500
 we are in no way happy with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.040
 our operation what yes that has 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 if we are positive there are players who 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.520
 they are raising their hands to be 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.680
 considered in the league and that is one of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 the objectives of course winning the cup 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 would be another goal but the one that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.210
 players have competition rhythm and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.869
 that encourage me sports competition 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.149
 inside the campus is the best and the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.270
 better news is the best opportunity 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.520
 for everyone and if there are several I'm not going to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.729
 say names because there are several that without 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.149
 doubt they have high grades and 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.440
 those who do not insist today either 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 I have to be so severe that being 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.090
 cold- tempered make an evaluation and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.549
 know that we have the revenge 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.450
 that crossing against MÃ©rida is another better 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.799
 opportunity to correct and resume what 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.880
 that we were doing in the glass to a 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.950
 functioning 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.380
 acceptable with arrival with goals with 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.330
 results and with performance is what 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 that we are going to aspire to correct for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.110
 with just the cup for the time being you have to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.370
 close this chapter of the phase of 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.980
 groups and tomorrow focus completely 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.769
 in what is the league and what is water is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.959
 you know how the rest of your colleagues 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.300
 here what is our reality in 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.380
 the league what is the environment which is 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.540
 the situation is obvious that I would like 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.890
 put to the best that I have in glass of 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.510
 league 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.650
 you have to consider this is a team with 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.650
 an average high age 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.320
 when young people need two days 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.330
 to recover maybe an athlete from 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.490
 older age needs up to three or 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.460
 probably four what he does not want 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.550
 to say that we shy away from our commitment 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.400
 with the love of going to look for the cup 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.440
 be with this group but in another version 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
 the one we had shown with another face 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.410
 that we have shown until today or 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.810
 maybe one or two that can 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.820
 insert for that match against average 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.430
 but I insist until we return to 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.160
 cup right now in our approach is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 jaguars could not be left with anything fell 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.960
 the goal in the least expected way and in 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.050
 the moment perhaps less expected was 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.810
 so to say how is a result 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.490
 with a lot of luck for us 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.350
 but saving this match from what 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.450
 Regarding the group stage cup , 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.400
 previous the team played it very well 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500
 that's right so people should be 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.580
 happy and surely the expectations 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.280
 of people for the league are going to be so 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.239
 as the team takes the step and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.800
 for the cup 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.760
 they will want to see us in the semifinals and there 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.760
 let's aim for it
