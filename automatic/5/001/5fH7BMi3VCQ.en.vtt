00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
all right this is definitely one way

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.789 
all right this is definitely one way
that<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.909> could<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.579> it's<00:02:15.579> already

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
that you could do that and it's already

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.440 
that you could do that and it's already
right<00:02:17.799> here<00:02:18.040> looking<00:02:18.430> at<00:02:18.579> you<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.879> see<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
right here looking at you you see it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.009 
right here looking at you you see it
would<00:02:19.599> work<00:02:19.810> very<00:02:20.170> easily<00:02:20.700> however<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.510> have

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
would work very easily however I have

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.399 
would work very easily however I have
made<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.560> suggestion<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:25.659> developer<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
made the suggestion to the developer of

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.039 
made the suggestion to the developer of
this<00:02:26.560> they<00:02:26.950> should<00:02:27.220> put<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.760> iPhone<00:02:28.390> skins

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
this they should put the iPhone skins

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.920 
this they should put the iPhone skins
and<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.920> iPad<00:02:30.519> skins<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.690> would<00:02:34.690> be<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
and the iPad skins for this would be a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.099 
and the iPad skins for this would be a
lot<00:02:35.260> better<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:36.459> know<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.609> lot<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.180> lot<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.690> users

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
lot better you know a lot a lot of users

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.809 
lot better you know a lot a lot of users
would<00:02:38.349> then<00:02:38.909> come<00:02:39.909> over<00:02:39.939> to<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.140> particular

here with you if we click brightness on

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.649 
here with you if we click brightness on
and<00:03:58.840> then<00:03:58.959> just<00:03:59.109> look<00:03:59.680> at<00:03:59.799> this<00:04:01.109> okay

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
and then just look at this okay

and then just look at this okay
you<00:04:04.659> can<00:04:04.840> flip<00:04:05.110> horizontally<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.879> can<00:04:07.090> flip

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
you can flip horizontally you can flip

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.160 
you can flip horizontally you can flip
it<00:04:07.540> vertically<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:10.030> can<00:04:10.239> just<00:04:10.450> do<00:04:10.900> all

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
it vertically and you can just do all

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.550 
it vertically and you can just do all
sorts<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.799> thing<00:04:12.040> here<00:04:12.280> with<00:04:12.459> your<00:04:12.640> saturation

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
sorts of thing here with your saturation

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.890 
sorts of thing here with your saturation
you<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.980> can<00:04:15.220> then<00:04:15.549> compare<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.630> two<00:04:16.870> and

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
you you can then compare the two and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.020 
you you can then compare the two and
then<00:04:17.290> when<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.650> come<00:04:17.919> out<00:04:17.949> it'll<00:04:18.699> make<00:04:18.880> the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
then when you come out it'll make the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.780 
then when you come out it'll make the
whole<00:04:19.180> screen<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.810> way<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.829> if<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.430> you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
whole screen that way so if you if you

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.730 
whole screen that way so if you if you
were<00:04:21.940> wanting<00:04:22.389> to<00:04:22.419> make<00:04:22.780> your<00:04:23.050> screen<00:04:23.440> look

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
were wanting to make your screen look

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.800 
were wanting to make your screen look
like<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.130> was<00:04:24.280> black<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.669> white<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:25.479> can<00:04:25.540> just

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
like it was black and white you can just

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.439 
like it was black and white you can just
turn<00:04:26.050> off<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.500> saturation<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:28.030> there<00:04:28.270> you

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
turn off the saturation and in there you

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.719 
turn off the saturation and in there you
