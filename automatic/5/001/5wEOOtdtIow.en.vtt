00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 very good we are here freeing what 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.210
 is the last phone of orange laurent 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.710
 I can see how you are asking 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 the lock code with a card 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.139
 movistar then let's proceed to what 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.740
 which is the liberation first we have to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.740
 turn off your phone 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.220
 we connect usb cable 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.990
 we will have to make a first 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 installation of the drivers that 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.230
 consist on the one hand of what is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.640
 uninstall using the point rhythm 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.710
 bat 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.140
 and then we will have to move on to install it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.910
 using the insta to the bat we already 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.430
 we have done it and should not give any 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.870
 type of problem sends them some kind 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.150
 of drivers you will have that those 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.950
 smartphone drivers betty 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 now we go directly to what is 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.690
 the software where we will have to do 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.390
 first the phone selection 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 we started doing what is this 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.270
 selection with the 40 15 that is at 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.710
 Khater in the background and he simply 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.710
 we give connect 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.540
 as we have marked it, nothing will tell us that 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.940
 we mark pace without blog we give to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.930
 connect 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 and we wait 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.119
 if you see that it does not detect the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.490
 phone simply what you have to 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.909
 do is disconnect it and return it to 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 connect 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.659
 now he has detected it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.659
 is working on it 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.630
 we have already obtained the codes as 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.990
 we can see here behind tells us that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.940
 is locked in the first of all 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 simply because if we say that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.170
 I released them 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.569
 and until now we can try 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.989
 quietly and our traditional one 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.989
 will have released 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.010
 ah 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.750
 As you can see, the operation does not need more 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.459
 20 seconds 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.740
 once sets the first time and without 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.370
 installing the drivers should not give 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.370
 no problem 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.810
 we introduce the foot 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.060
 and you no longer choose coverage as I go to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.950
 be with a nice background of orange 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.420
 I hope you liked it and soon the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.830
 tutorial also to flash this 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.830
