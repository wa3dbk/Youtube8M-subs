all right Burt brothers this is a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.579 
all right Burt brothers this is a

and cause of failure on this unit the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.570 
and cause of failure on this unit the
radiator<00:00:15.470> failed<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> glycol<00:00:16.949> test<00:00:17.279> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
radiator failed the glycol test that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.460 
radiator failed the glycol test that
allowed<00:00:17.880> coolant<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> get<00:00:18.900> back<00:00:19.080> into<00:00:19.380> the

allowed coolant to get back into the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.700 
allowed coolant to get back into the
transmission<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:21.710> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
transmission and you can see how the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.349 
transmission and you can see how the
pump<00:00:23.400> gaskets<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.500> waffled<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.970> from<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
pump gaskets have waffled up from the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.370 
pump gaskets have waffled up from the
coolant<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.869> gets<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.320> there<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.760> also

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
coolant that gets in there and that also

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670 
coolant that gets in there and that also
attaches<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.040> attacks<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.840> clutches<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
attaches and attacks the clutches and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.530 
attaches and attacks the clutches and
starts<00:00:35.130> emulsify<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.730> lift<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> lining<00:00:36.420> off

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
starts emulsify and lift the lining off

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
starts emulsify and lift the lining off
the<00:00:36.690> clutches<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the clutches you can see how the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.650 
the clutches you can see how the
clutches<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.120> gotten<00:00:39.390> extremely

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
clutches have gotten extremely

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.549 
clutches have gotten extremely
overheated<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.700> burnt<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.260> set

for converter as well and in addition to

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
for converter as well and in addition to
this<00:01:43.569> repair<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:45.340> only<00:01:45.610> if<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.759> have<00:01:45.940> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this repair not only if you have a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.960 
this repair not only if you have a
patent<00:01:47.170> hot<00:01:47.590> flush<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.549> we're<00:01:48.670> gonna<00:01:48.789> have<00:01:48.940> to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
patent hot flush so we're gonna have to

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.699 
patent hot flush so we're gonna have to
replace<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:50.069> radiator<00:01:51.069> assembly<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.709> we'll

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
replace the radiator assembly and we'll

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.410 
replace the radiator assembly and we'll
be<00:01:53.799> installing<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.310> new<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.729> theater<00:01:55.060> with

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
be installing the new is a theater with

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.199 
be installing the new is a theater with
new<00:01:55.929> engine<00:01:56.440> coolant<00:01:56.770> as<00:01:56.950> well<00:01:57.159> along<00:01:58.149> with

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
new engine coolant as well along with

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.899 
new engine coolant as well along with
the<00:01:58.479> rebuild<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.319> don't<00:01:59.580> damage<00:02:00.580> a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
the rebuild so that we don't damage a

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.699 
the rebuild so that we don't damage a
brand<00:02:01.119> new<00:02:01.240> rebuilt<00:02:01.600> transmission<00:02:02.200> again<00:02:02.439> so

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
brand new rebuilt transmission again so

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.199 
brand new rebuilt transmission again so
there<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.429> have<00:02:03.459> it

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
there you have it

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.520 
there you have it
I'll<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.600> estimate<00:02:05.049> off<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.350> here

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
I'll get this estimate off to here

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.120 
I'll get this estimate off to here
shortly<00:02:05.890> along<00:02:06.670> with<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.939> video<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:09.069> is

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
shortly along with the video this is

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.060
