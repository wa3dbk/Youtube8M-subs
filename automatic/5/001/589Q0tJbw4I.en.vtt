00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
so today I'm going to be going over

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.350 
so today I'm going to be going over
my<00:00:06.750> garage

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
my garage

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.850 
my garage
reef<00:00:10.049> some<00:00:10.559> system

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.240 

I'm<00:00:14.429> sure<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:15.179> many<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> guys<00:00:15.900> know<00:00:16.350> or

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I'm sure as many of you guys know or

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.159 
I'm sure as many of you guys know or
have<00:00:17.760> done<00:00:20.779> I'm<00:00:21.919> constantly<00:00:22.919> thinking<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.960> new

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
have done I'm constantly thinking of new

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.450 
have done I'm constantly thinking of new
things<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:27.650> thinking<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> ways<00:00:28.919> to<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.250> things

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
things or thinking of ways to do things

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.200 
things or thinking of ways to do things
better

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
better

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.160 
better
so<00:00:30.869> yesterday<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.649> kind<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.570> reset<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.870> sump

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so yesterday I kind of reset up my sump

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.030 
so yesterday I kind of reset up my sump
design<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.910> over<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:40.040> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
design and I will go over that now the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.080 
design and I will go over that now the
main<00:00:41.280> display<00:00:41.700> tank<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:44.719> inside<00:00:45.719> upstairs<00:00:47.090> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
main display tank is inside upstairs so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.110 
main display tank is inside upstairs so
the<00:00:48.480> water<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.920> gravity<00:00:50.880> fed

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the water is basically just gravity fed

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.710 
the water is basically just gravity fed
down<00:00:51.450> to<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.860> where<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> skimmer<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
down to this where the skimmer is and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.720 
down to this where the skimmer is and
the<00:00:57.810> refugium<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:59.670> then<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.390> goes<00:01:01.460> into<00:01:02.460> what

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the refugium it then just goes into what

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.190 
the refugium it then just goes into what
I<00:01:02.760> call<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.360> frag<00:01:04.399> frag<00:01:05.399> tank

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
I call the frag frag tank

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.160 
I call the frag frag tank
it's<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.439> Rubbermaid<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.790> top<00:01:10.189> finally

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's the Rubbermaid up on top finally

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.690 
it's the Rubbermaid up on top finally
goes<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> filter<00:01:13.649> sock<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.399> here

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
goes through a filter sock right here

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.880 
goes through a filter sock right here
and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.320> starts<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.369> again

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.520 

as<00:01:22.370> far<00:01:22.700> as<00:01:22.729> my<00:01:23.150> return<00:01:24.080> pump<00:01:25.990> it's<00:01:26.990> hard<00:01:27.380> to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
as far as my return pump it's hard to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.010 
as far as my return pump it's hard to
see<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.920> but<00:01:28.190> using<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:29.090> hammerhead<00:01:29.800> pump

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.289 

so<00:01:35.560> I'm<00:01:35.619> using<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:36.540> hammerhead<00:01:37.540> pump<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.090> cool

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
so I'm using a hammerhead pump the cool

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.740 
so I'm using a hammerhead pump the cool
thing<00:01:40.479> about<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.720> pump<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:43.270> does<00:01:43.509> come

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
thing about that pump is it does come

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.070 
thing about that pump is it does come
with<00:01:43.840> two<00:01:43.899> different<00:01:44.170> impellers<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.810> do

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
with two different impellers you can do

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.469 
with two different impellers you can do
either<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.530> believe<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.310> 5,000<00:01:49.090> gallons<00:01:49.360> per

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
either I believe it's 5,000 gallons per

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.370 
either I believe it's 5,000 gallons per
hours<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:51.360> 3,600<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.509> just<00:01:52.659> have<00:01:52.810> 3,600

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
hours or 3,600 so I just have 3,600

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.760 
hours or 3,600 so I just have 3,600
right<00:01:53.770> now<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:54.250> saves<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.640> power<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:56.649> what

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
right now so it saves on power for what

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.320 
right now so it saves on power for what
you<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.460> really<00:01:57.610> doesn't<00:01:57.939> use<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.179> that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
you get it really doesn't use all that

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.450 
you get it really doesn't use all that
much<00:01:58.509> power<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.700> have<00:02:01.360> had<00:02:01.630> issues<00:02:02.560> with<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.860> I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
much power I have had issues with it I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.580 
much power I have had issues with it I
had<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.030> replace<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.539> seal<00:02:04.750> like<00:02:04.960> three<00:02:05.289> times

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
had to replace the seal like three times

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.229 
had to replace the seal like three times
and<00:02:06.090> over<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.179> course<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.600> six<00:02:07.869> months<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:10.209> I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
and over the course of six months so I

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.490 
and over the course of six months so I
don't<00:02:10.569> know<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.929> would<00:02:11.049> really<00:02:11.260> recommend

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
don't know that I would really recommend

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.160 
don't know that I would really recommend
it<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:13.239> one<00:02:13.540> isn't<00:02:13.959> leaking<00:02:14.470> currently

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it but this one isn't leaking currently

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.479 
it but this one isn't leaking currently
but<00:02:17.170> basically<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:20.049> being<00:02:20.350> fed<00:02:20.680> from<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
but basically it's being fed from the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.210 
but basically it's being fed from the
bottom<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.709> going<00:02:24.069> up

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
bottom and then it it's it's going up

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.380 
bottom and then it it's it's going up
very<00:02:24.430> important<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.390> make<00:02:25.600> sure<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> have

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
very important to make sure you have

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.289 
very important to make sure you have
ball<00:02:28.390> valves<00:02:28.870> everywhere<00:02:29.350> because<00:02:30.209> if<00:02:31.209> you

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
ball valves everywhere because if you

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.699 
ball valves everywhere because if you
ever<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.660> take<00:02:31.810> something<00:02:32.140> apart<00:02:32.230> if

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
ever have to take something apart if

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.710 
ever have to take something apart if
you're<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.190> getting<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> reefing<00:02:34.540> and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
you're just getting in to reefing and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.500 
you're just getting in to reefing and
designing<00:02:35.280> these<00:02:36.280> valves<00:02:36.760> are<00:02:36.880> about<00:02:37.120> 20

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
designing these valves are about 20

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.650 
designing these valves are about 20
bucks<00:02:37.720> apiece<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.880> believe<00:02:40.209> me<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.510> worth

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
bucks apiece but believe me it's worth

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.819 
bucks apiece but believe me it's worth
it<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.900> everything's<00:02:43.900> kind<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.230> insulated

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
it so everything's kind of insulated

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.690 
it so everything's kind of insulated
because<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.250> does<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:45.940> cold<00:02:46.150> here

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
because it does get really cold here

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.949 
because it does get really cold here
basically<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.000> what<00:02:52.180> controls<00:02:52.570> my

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
basically this is what controls my

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.060 
basically this is what controls my
amount<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.980> water<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.430> goes<00:02:54.579> into<00:02:54.850> my<00:02:55.090> tank

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
amount of water that goes into my tank

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.120 
amount of water that goes into my tank
just<00:02:57.070> throttle<00:02:57.489> back<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.000> bypass<00:02:58.540> valve

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
just throttle back this bypass valve

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.960 
just throttle back this bypass valve
that<00:03:00.130> way<00:03:00.280> you're<00:03:00.459> not<00:03:00.579> putting<00:03:00.730> back

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
that way you're not putting back

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.380 
that way you're not putting back
pressure<00:03:01.299> onto<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> pump<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.519> just<00:03:03.940> built

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
pressure onto the pump but I just built

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.569 
pressure onto the pump but I just built
this<00:03:04.569> manifold<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:07.600> have<00:03:08.160> lots<00:03:09.160> of

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
this manifold and I have lots of

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.680 
this manifold and I have lots of
different<00:03:10.390> areas<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:11.109> hook<00:03:11.380> things<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
different areas to hook things on to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.860 
different areas to hook things on to
this<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.900> all<00:03:14.019> inch<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.410> 1/2<00:03:14.500> PVC<00:03:15.600> then<00:03:16.600> just

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
this is all inch and 1/2 PVC then just

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.099 
this is all inch and 1/2 PVC then just
one<00:03:17.049> inch<00:03:17.819> plugs<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.489> actual<00:03:21.780> line<00:03:22.780> going

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
one inch plugs so the actual line going

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.259 
one inch plugs so the actual line going
to<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> tank<00:03:23.530> goes<00:03:23.739> through<00:03:23.980> right<00:03:24.160> here<00:03:24.269> and

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
to the tank goes through right here and

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:44.780 
to the tank goes through right here and
here's<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.440> return<00:03:26.799> coming<00:03:27.220> right<00:03:27.400> here

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.270 

well<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.420> water<00:03:46.909> just<00:03:47.909> flows<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.540> here

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.309 

I<00:03:53.370> did<00:03:54.180> put<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.890> divider<00:03:56.400> right<00:03:56.550> here

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
I did put this this divider right here

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.440 
I did put this this divider right here
so<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.890> only<00:03:59.010> water<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.880> through<00:04:00.300> my

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so that the only water going through my

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.140 
so that the only water going through my
system<00:04:00.870> has<00:04:01.080> been<00:04:01.290> skimmed<00:04:04.190> that's<00:04:05.190> here's<00:04:05.940> my

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
system has been skimmed that's here's my

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.990 
system has been skimmed that's here's my
drain<00:04:06.420> right<00:04:06.630> here<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.050> comes<00:04:07.640> through<00:04:08.640> here

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
drain right here that comes through here

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.510 
drain right here that comes through here
this<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.370> emergency<00:04:11.370> drain<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:13.520> then

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
this is the emergency drain and then

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.170 
this is the emergency drain and then
right<00:04:14.850> here<00:04:16.730> I've<00:04:17.730> got<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:18.090> refugium<00:04:18.570> white

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.210 

Oh

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:45.879 

see<00:04:34.460> macroalgae<00:04:34.999> is<00:04:35.330> growing

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.290

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.740 
so now coming over to here this is the
frag<00:04:53.300> tank<00:04:56.319> do<00:04:57.319> have<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:58.069> do<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.580> BRS<00:04:59.270> two-part

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
frag tank do have I do the BRS two-part

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.179 
frag tank do have I do the BRS two-part
dosing<00:05:01.990> right<00:05:02.990> now<00:05:03.199> as<00:05:03.409> you<00:05:03.530> can<00:05:03.680> see<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.949> don't

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
really have much in the way of frags

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.570 
really have much in the way of frags
I<00:05:08.180> did<00:05:08.960> do<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.199> couple<00:05:09.319> frags

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.189 

this<00:05:15.180> morning<00:05:15.720> but<00:05:17.240> all<00:05:18.240> plenty<00:05:18.750> of<00:05:18.840> room<00:05:19.020> now

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.649

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
from there it just drains down into a

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:40.530 
from there it just drains down into a
150<00:05:33.409> gallon

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.020 

I<00:05:45.780> found<00:05:46.780> that<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.080> cut<00:05:47.500> these<00:05:48.400> edges<00:05:48.850> on<00:05:49.000> a

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
I found that if you cut these edges on a

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.709 
I found that if you cut these edges on a
bevel<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.870> can<00:05:50.080> have<00:05:50.610> pull<00:05:51.610> outs

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.339
