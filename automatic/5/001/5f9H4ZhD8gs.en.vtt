00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
comments of one of my other videos and I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
comments of one of my other videos and I
decided<00:00:15.990> now<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> good<00:00:16.740> time<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.250> ahead

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
decided now is a good time to go ahead

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300 
decided now is a good time to go ahead
and<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:19.230> don't<00:00:19.770> know<00:00:19.890> anything<00:00:20.130> about

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and do that I don't know anything about

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
and do that I don't know anything about
this<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.119> know<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.600> probably<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
this all I know is that it's probably a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.920 
this all I know is that it's probably a
song<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:23.670> long<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.570> long<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
song because how long I get how long it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.929 
song because how long I get how long it
is<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.050> long<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.670> roughly<00:00:28.609> 2<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
is how long is it it is roughly 2 and a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.229 
is how long is it it is roughly 2 and a
half<00:00:30.090> minutes<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.850> probably

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
half minutes or so so it's probably

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.440 
half minutes or so so it's probably
either<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.480> song<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> short<00:00:34.230> animation

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450
