the walkway here you can see there's a
little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.590> curve<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
little bit of a curve to it which is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.020 
little bit of a curve to it which is
that<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:12.030> aesthetic<00:01:12.510> appeal<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
little bit nicer than just a regular

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.310 
little bit nicer than just a regular
concrete<00:01:17.009> walkway<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.320> generally
