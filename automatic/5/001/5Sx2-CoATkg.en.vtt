00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 hey i am johannes of news.de and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.490
 the touchlet x2 has an android tablet there 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 just running android 2.2 on it like 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 The key facts 7 inch touch screen display 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 wlan 800 megahertz cpu and one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.820
 g-sensor on the opposite 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.890
 side we have even more detailed spex 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 but we prefer to pack this device now 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:48.620
 first out of here is also equal to 7 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.120
 inch still pleasant handy I think 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.859
 and of size comparable to that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 Samsung Galaxy Tab became the archos 7 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.079
 but we will come to the device later 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.210
 Let's have a look at something here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.140
 still in the box is there we have here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 the usb cable usb to a proprietary one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:26.340
 plug we have the power adapter too 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 back on the same plug and here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.750
 we still have a device as 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.660
 stand serves but can also be used for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.870
 Kfz bracket can be used as you 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.220
 So look like the judges bowl that 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.490
 is it also a judge peel I know 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490
 not exactly 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 because you can then simply the tablet to 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:57.870
 bring it has a good stop so 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 every case very safe and behind the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.710
 Stand the tablet then on the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.800
 can stand and not to forget 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.679
 the manual in german and french 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.690
 there is everything in it if you are 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.690
 not familiar with android etc 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.550
 Let's take a look at the x2 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.350
 a little closer 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.960
 So in any case pleasantly handy 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.520
 I think 7 inch tablets are the ideal ones 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.130
 size 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.570
 this has now become resistive touchscreen 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.240
 not too thick the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.830
 Workmanship is very good 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.150
 Maybe you can do it in the back 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.640
 recognize it has such a rubberized 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 surface and here a nice android 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:50.710
 logo here we have the android hardware 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.090
 buttons home menu back search and here 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.640
 in four ways steering cross 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.410
 I find even better than touch 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 buttons do not look like that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.610
 on it and you have good pressure point and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.820
 Here we have the vga camera 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.310
 which is good for video conferencing or 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.960
 also snapshots but does not expect any 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.550
 wonder 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.910
 on the top we have the button 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.410
 for the volume and then another 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.360
 normal usb port on the bottom 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.540
 then the proprietary plug for that 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.890
 USB cable and the power adapter on the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220
 left side we have the power 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.620
 button two status leds a headset port 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.710
 a micro sd card reader and a reset 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.710
 button 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.200
 Let's take a look at a few others 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.720
 Tablets are similar to the touchlet x2 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.490
 I have the trick here 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.860
 tablet and smartphone with 5 inches 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:52.840
 of course a bit thinner and 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:55.990
 of course the apple ipad that was mine 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.120
 mobile phone to touchlet x2 android tablet 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.720
