00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 listen 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:22.010

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.580
 really cool 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.380
 listen to the radio right in minecraft and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 still not closing in bancroft and not such 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 I open the browser this is very convenient 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
 in short let's generally watch 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.500
 understand what's what and so all that you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 need to listen to the radio is a link to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 online radio that you like or 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 actually this one here is a block 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 which is added with this mod crafting 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.489
 You can see the way by the link in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 description and so let's understand how 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.969
 click here and here here here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.949
 It is necessary to put the very same reference that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 you want to listen to the radio that is, well, roughly 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 insert here link to radio chanson i 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.439
 personally put one of these links which 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 Were on standard in description mod so 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.150
 that don't be angry if some kind of music 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 so I honestly did not even listen and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.950
 so let's try it here's how 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.460
 I understood the volume control and try 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.460
 to add 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 okay, it's time to turn this music off 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 I'm being banned for copyright 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.680
 imagine 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.900
 DJ on the server will just be 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.080

 turn on and move away 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.750
 moved away what will happen if we move away 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
 musical block they are infinitely it still 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.459
 one plus it's time to break it openly 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.850

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.170
