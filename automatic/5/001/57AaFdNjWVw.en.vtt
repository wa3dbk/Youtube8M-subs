body that if the gasoline in the car

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.390 
body that if the gasoline in the car
makes<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.630> go<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.500> simple<00:04:59.860> sugars<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.310> the

makes it go and simple sugars in the
body<00:05:00.550> they<00:05:00.790> get<00:05:01.000> go<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.510> asked<00:05:02.320> them<00:05:02.440> what<00:05:02.590> is

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
body they get go I asked them what is

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.770 
body they get go I asked them what is
the<00:05:02.830> gasoline<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.400> brain<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.330> they<00:05:04.510> think

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
the gasoline to the brain and they think

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.990 
the gasoline to the brain and they think
regular<00:05:05.290> food<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:06.040> it's<00:05:06.190> actually<00:05:06.490> protein

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
regular food but it's actually protein

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.330 
regular food but it's actually protein
every<00:05:07.720> living<00:05:07.960> cell<00:05:08.230> needs<00:05:08.680> protein<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
every living cell needs protein and the

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.460 
every living cell needs protein and the
brain<00:05:09.520> really<00:05:09.700> needs<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.450> run<00:05:10.630> so<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.110> get<00:05:11.410> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
brain really needs it to run so I get to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.080
