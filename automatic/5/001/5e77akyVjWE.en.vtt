00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:09.420
 now we are going to present a review of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 the two months of checked with the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 original and compatible from another point 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 it's good we start with the original the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.440
 original in a bag according to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.350
 the go pro hologram and its respective 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.980
 string label hospitais loop 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.020
 According to stern it is coming in here 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 agree and you can always save it 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.529
 that you want in the same bag then 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.069
 let's see the characteristics of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.350
 original harness carries a high clip of 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:40.769
 According to an adjustment screw for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 adjust to hold your voice but then 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:48.420
 the different this harness carries the logo 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.449
 of the Swiss brand and the logo on the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.659
 harness to the front and logo 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.920
 in the back of the goal but 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.610
 agreement the material is a material 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.310
 bright in bright plastic 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.250
 a very flexible rubber for any 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:09.940
 Body diameter and time of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.940
 fixation is a click we open it 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.710
 we put it as suspenders 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.930
 and to close it to adjust body 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.880
 we take and we close 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.860
 well this has been the original harness 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.080
 for compatible males is not 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.000
 compatible plastic bag 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 agreement 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 and the characteristics of stern is that it is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.560
 that for example in the staple we do not put 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.450
 Nor ahead and not behind the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 material is a bright plastic equal 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 already for the same anchors as the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.890
 original what changes from this to the other 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.190
 is the rubber looks more or less the same 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 quality but I do not know exactly and 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.600
 the extender with a flat gravel the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 extensor I think it's much more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 versatile that a high staple agree and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 they have the same adjustment screw and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 it gets exactly the same as we opened 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 here we put it in ernest form and 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.930
 we close again this has been a 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.930
 author revelation points
