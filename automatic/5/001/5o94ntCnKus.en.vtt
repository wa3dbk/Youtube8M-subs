00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 to install and download 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 so it's a cool online rpg game 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 so anyway, let's go guys 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 you will first see that in your 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.219
 internet in your browser and come here 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 on the mall 's official website and it's not that I 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.820
 I do not know how to pronounce the name of the game. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 the game but let's leave it is the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 www.inep.gov.br and leaving in the description 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 the link not this link but the link for you 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.340
 will you leave, will you come here on the site at 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.879
 and will stay here at 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.879
 download 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.820
 But I'm back and I'll leave it here. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 download link for you here at 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 first here the download will have three 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.040
 file types 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.830
 the evil is complete the compact and the pet né 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 Good here is going to have the complete will be the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 conson the game with 31 and the compact the without 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 sound good 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.180
 the difference of the two because they left 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.729
 sun and other with 100 sound good consonant 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 157 6 goes if the sensor is this Friday 1 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.850
 megabyte so it is lighter and 61 but I 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 recommend super recommend you download the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.610
 complete with sound is thing it's a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.689
 bit heavier plus 150 megabytes not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 it's nothing right 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.369
 it will take a little longer just a little 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.299
 but it's worth even more 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.770
 game is to download the complete with the sound né 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.200
 but it makes no sense for you to play a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 without sound is today what comes with your 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 you download rise so I thought I 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.340
 I recommend using 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.790
 a sound you here looks you do or not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 they will stay in the first option 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.690
 You are here already will start already download up 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 be waiting if you want to download 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.660
