00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
that to make sure that they did work so

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.800 
that to make sure that they did work so
Super<00:02:52.780> Metroid<00:02:56.550> it's<00:02:57.550> not<00:02:57.730> coming<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.180> okay

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
Super Metroid it's not coming on okay

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.810 
Super Metroid it's not coming on okay
that<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.770> kind<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.010> crazy<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.580> just

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
that it's kind of crazy I know I just

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.960 
that it's kind of crazy I know I just
played<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.270> once<00:03:02.340> sometimes<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.550> guess<00:03:03.730> if<00:03:03.850> I

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
played it once sometimes I guess if I

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.410 
played it once sometimes I guess if I
don't<00:03:04.150> stick<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> correctly<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:07.360> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
don't stick it in correctly it's a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.640 
don't stick it in correctly it's a
little<00:03:07.630> finicky<00:03:07.750> there<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.350> go

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:20.130 

so<00:03:11.650> Super<00:03:12.190> Metroid<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.880> know<00:03:13.060> does<00:03:13.510> work<00:03:19.140> these

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
so Super Metroid I know does work these

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.170 
so Super Metroid I know does work these
are<00:03:20.200> not<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.770> game<00:03:21.100> saves<00:03:21.460> either<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
are not my game saves either it's the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.250 
are not my game saves either it's the
original<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:23.350> original<00:03:23.680> owner<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> game

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
original the original owner of the game

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.610 
original the original owner of the game
so<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:27.070> works<00:03:27.310> as<00:03:27.490> well<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.630> Super

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
so that that works as well so Super

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.250 
so that that works as well so Super
Metroid<00:03:32.770> works<00:03:34.770> let's<00:03:35.770> see<00:03:36.750> he<00:03:37.750> also<00:03:37.900> wanted

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
jump I think a mega jump just died can i

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.320 
jump I think a mega jump just died can i
play<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:03.490> game

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.570 

one-handed<00:05:07.349> we<00:05:08.349> try<00:05:08.560> again<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.099> just<00:05:09.340> want<00:05:09.520> to

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
one-handed we try again I just want to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.110 
one-handed we try again I just want to
show<00:05:09.759> people<00:05:09.789> that<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.960> code<00:05:11.199> did<00:05:11.470> work<00:05:15.120> okay

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
show people that the code did work okay

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.960 
show people that the code did work okay
I<00:05:16.150> should<00:05:16.389> be<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.509> little<00:05:16.720> it<00:05:16.840> jump<00:05:17.080> super<00:05:17.409> high

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
I should be a little it jump super high

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.240 
I should be a little it jump super high
so<00:05:18.970> I'm<00:05:19.060> jumping<00:05:19.360> off<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.110> screen<00:05:23.039> anyway

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
so I'm jumping off the screen anyway

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.129 
so I'm jumping off the screen anyway
so<00:05:24.430> usually<00:05:24.909> Mario<00:05:25.360> can't<00:05:25.599> jump<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.020> high

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
so usually Mario can't jump that high

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.580 
so usually Mario can't jump that high
but<00:05:26.979> anyway<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.460> code<00:05:27.669> is<00:05:27.849> working<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:29.080> game

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
but anyway the code is working so game

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.960 
but anyway the code is working so game
genie<00:05:29.830> works<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:31.169> last<00:05:32.169> but<00:05:32.380> not<00:05:32.560> least
