that's up on my website if you've not

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.400 
that's up on my website if you've not
the<00:00:27.119> native<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.750> probably<00:00:27.960> want<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.199> start

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the native way probably want to start

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.960 
the native way probably want to start
off<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> lot<00:00:29.460> more<00:00:29.640> simple

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
off with that one it's a lot more simple

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.569 
off with that one it's a lot more simple
and<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.470> gets<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> used<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> way

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and it's just gets you used to the way

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.900 
and it's just gets you used to the way
they<00:00:32.910> work<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.360> whatnot<00:00:34.610> when<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:35.730> doing

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
they work and whatnot when you're doing

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.790 
they work and whatnot when you're doing
these<00:00:36.030> tricks<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.630> somewhere<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.230> away<00:00:37.530> from

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
these tricks go somewhere like away from

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
these tricks go somewhere like away from
expensive<00:00:38.430> equipment<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.149> they're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
expensive equipment because they're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
expensive equipment because they're
pretty<00:00:39.510> heavy<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.950> drop<00:00:41.520> them

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
pretty heavy and you know you drop them

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
pretty heavy and you know you drop them
and<00:00:41.940> fling<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> trying<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and fling them about when you trying to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
and fling them about when you trying to
learn<00:00:43.320> tricks<00:00:43.620> I've<00:00:43.890> already<00:00:44.280> dented<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.610> my

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
learn tricks I've already dented my my

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.619 
learn tricks I've already dented my my
laptop<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.140> off<00:00:46.230> mic<00:00:46.500> which<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.820> good<00:00:48.090> at

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
laptop my off mic which is not good at

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
laptop my off mic which is not good at
all<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.649> yeah

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
all so yeah

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.709 
all so yeah
I'm<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.700> doing<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.239> bedroom<00:00:51.449> just

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I'm just doing one of my bedroom just

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.910 
I'm just doing one of my bedroom just
took<00:00:51.780> everything<00:00:52.079> off<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.530> doing<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
took everything off what we're doing in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
took everything off what we're doing in
the<00:00:52.980> middle<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.250> bed<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.879> drop<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the middle of bed so if I do drop it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.139 
the middle of bed so if I do drop it
then<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> break<00:00:55.289> anything<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
then it's not going to break anything so

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
then it's not going to break anything so
here<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.750> windmill<00:00:58.350> trick<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> first

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
here is my windmill trick so first

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
here is my windmill trick so first
things<00:00:59.969> first<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.629> you've<00:01:01.050> got<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.320> bite

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
things first is you've got your bite

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
things first is you've got your bite
handle<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> like

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
handle which is this one with the like

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
handle which is this one with the like
latch<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.710> lock<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.549> you've<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.880> your

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
latch the lock and then you've got your

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.719 
latch the lock and then you've got your
safe<00:01:06.210> handle<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.920> called<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> bite<00:01:08.369> handle

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
safe handle this is called a bite handle

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
safe handle this is called a bite handle
because<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.479> side<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> knife<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
because this side of the knife is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.250 
because this side of the knife is
usually<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> sharp<00:01:11.220> side<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> knife<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
usually the sharp side a knife but

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
usually the sharp side a knife but
sometimes<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> other<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
sometimes it's the other way around you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
sometimes it's the other way around you
just<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> check<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.360> yours<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just want to check that on yours you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
just want to check that on yours you
care<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.369> last<00:01:17.549> few<00:01:17.670> has<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> bite

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
care because the last few has the bite

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.560 
care because the last few has the bite
handle<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.939> sure<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.420> know

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
handle and so just make sure you know

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
handle and so just make sure you know
which<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.470> safe<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.150> safe

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
which side is safe if you is your safe

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.380 
which side is safe if you is your safe
side<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.080> one's<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.439> bite<00:01:25.740> handle

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
side and which one's your bite handle

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
side and which one's your bite handle
it's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.689> complicated<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's a bit complicated so I'm going to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
it's a bit complicated so I'm going to
take<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.240> video<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.500> bit

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
take my time with this video and go bit

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.520 
take my time with this video and go bit
by<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:33.000> hopefully<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> grips

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
by bit so you can hopefully get to grips

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
by bit so you can hopefully get to grips
of<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240 
of it
first<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.740> hold<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.100> you're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
first of all you want to hold it you're
