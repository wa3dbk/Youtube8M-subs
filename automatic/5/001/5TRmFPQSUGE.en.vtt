extremely helpful especially when you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.390 
extremely helpful especially when you
have<00:00:17.660> four<00:00:18.660> different<00:00:18.750> wigs<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.410> either

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
have four different wigs that either

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.050 
have four different wigs that either
have<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> sit<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.480> they're<00:00:21.869> spiky<00:00:23.060> or

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
have to sit out because they're spiky or

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.140 
have to sit out because they're spiky or
they<00:00:24.449> need<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.840> spiked<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:29.150> pretty

they need to be spiked like that pretty
soon<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.579> working

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
soon so this is actually now working

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
soon so this is actually now working
harder<00:00:36.120> story<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.590> explain<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
harder story now I can explain to you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.090 
harder story now I can explain to you
what<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.300> actually

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
what all this is this is actually

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.750 
what all this is this is actually
half-inch<00:00:41.100> size<00:00:41.879> pipe<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.489> here

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
half-inch size pipe and this right here

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:00.650 
half-inch size pipe and this right here
-<00:00:48.860> 14<00:00:52.460> something<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> 14<00:00:54.030> feet<00:00:59.149> 14<00:01:00.149> probably

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
- 14 something like 14 feet 14 probably

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
- 14 something like 14 feet 14 probably
just<00:01:00.780> depending<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.440> cut<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
just depending on how you cut it at the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.200 
just depending on how you cut it at the
bottom<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.370> makes<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> squared<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> hold<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
bottom this makes it squared and hold it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.000 
bottom this makes it squared and hold it
up<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> takes<00:01:04.909> four<00:01:05.909> different<00:01:06.240> elbows

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
up but it takes four different elbows

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.000 
up but it takes four different elbows
half-inch<00:01:08.010> elbows<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.140> four<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.439> half

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
half-inch elbows and four of these half

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.800 
half-inch elbows and four of these half
inch<00:01:11.159> T's<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> originally<00:01:18.570> take

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
inch T's and you can originally take

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.679 
inch T's and you can originally take
this<00:01:19.619> fight<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this fight but here you think it's one

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.820 
this fight but here you think it's one
piece<00:01:21.810> probably<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.619> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
piece probably but it's not it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
piece probably but it's not it's
actually<00:01:22.979> -<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.740> comes<00:01:25.950> apart<00:01:26.250> like

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
actually - it actually comes apart like

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
actually - it actually comes apart like
that<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.390> don't<00:01:28.320> recommend<00:01:28.500> doing<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> together

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that I don't recommend doing it together

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
that I don't recommend doing it together
because<00:01:29.450> you're<00:01:30.450> gonna<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because you're gonna want to take it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
because you're gonna want to take it
apart<00:01:39.049> yeah<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> cut

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
apart yeah and you just you can cut

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
apart yeah and you just you can cut
these<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.240> different<00:01:42.509> sizes<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
these to be different sizes this is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
these to be different sizes this is
gonna<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.619> closed<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> load<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.790> just

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
gonna be closed and load more just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.289 
gonna be closed and load more just
depending<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:46.140> math<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.299> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
depending on what math you want to do to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.130 
depending on what math you want to do to
put<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> together<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.970> yeah<00:01:51.000> half<00:01:51.720> inch<00:01:51.899> pipe

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
put it together but yeah half inch pipe

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.859 
put it together but yeah half inch pipe
is<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.860> fits<00:01:53.130> these<00:01:53.340> best<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.329> three

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is what fits these best I think three

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.370 
is what fits these best I think three
three<00:01:55.409> quarters<00:01:55.740> we're<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.189> big<00:01:57.380> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
three quarters we're gonna see big and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
three quarters we're gonna see big and
you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.829> use<00:01:58.920> any<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> pipe<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.880> recommend

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you can use any kind of pipe I recommend

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.620 
you can use any kind of pipe I recommend
regular<00:02:00.930> PVC<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.920> cheaper

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
regular PVC because it's way cheaper

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.399 
regular PVC because it's way cheaper
yeah<00:02:04.399> thanks
