00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.610
 3 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
 m 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.749
 next to him goes a little far 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.909
 I already know that he is actually very good 8 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.800
 I can't prevent 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
 a doctor 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.110
 Yes 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.230
 yes i am qualified athletes 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.060
 I think I wrote the script 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 Get all that out of the closet to get the touches 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.600
 like my head 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.110
 yes if I have learned but it happened it is a lot with each other 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.460
 connected 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 several years 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.320
 if you have done training 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 in Amsterdam 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 at back gym 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.830
 he broke a sports bag together 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.600
 well and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 m the token with then has an end 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 that is very well possible 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 your end 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 that means a sports doctor I don't think so 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 unfortunately I don't want to try it yet 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 I had just made it worse 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.970
 tension back 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 it is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.610
 this is what you are already doing 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 and afterwards top 10 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.070
 a dime below 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.420
 down the field to ten and you can close your eyes from the moment I was you 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.060
 4 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.549
