00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
well so I'm interested to see how the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.360 
well so I'm interested to see how the
sound<00:02:37.730> does<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:39.200> front<00:02:39.500> looks<00:02:39.860> really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
sound does and the front looks really

sound does and the front looks really
really<00:02:40.640> sharp<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.210> can<00:02:41.330> see<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> little

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
really sharp and you can see the little

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780

camera<00:02:42.080> for<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.710> facing<00:02:43.070> camera<00:02:43.370> there<00:02:43.520> as<00:02:43.610> well

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
camera for a facing camera there as well

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.470 
camera for a facing camera there as well
so<00:02:43.820> that's<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.330> actual<00:02:44.570> device<00:02:46.330> let's<00:02:47.330> go

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so that's the actual device let's go

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.420 
so that's the actual device let's go
ahead<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.660> pop<00:02:47.960> open<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.620> see<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.130> else<00:02:49.220> we

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
ahead and pop open and see what else we

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.300 
ahead and pop open and see what else we
have<00:02:49.460> in<00:02:49.880> here<00:02:50.320> got<00:02:51.730> some<00:02:52.730> instructions<00:02:54.310> how

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
have in here got some instructions how

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.000 
have in here got some instructions how
to<00:02:55.340> fire<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.700> up<00:02:56.000> we've<00:02:56.600> got<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.230> power

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
to fire it up we've got the power

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.570

adapter<00:02:58.670> looks<00:02:59.540> like<00:02:59.780> I<00:03:03.250> believe<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.400> is

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
adapter looks like I believe this is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.610 
adapter looks like I believe this is
wireless<00:03:05.239> charging<00:03:05.690> off<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.020> take<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.260> look<00:03:06.440> at
