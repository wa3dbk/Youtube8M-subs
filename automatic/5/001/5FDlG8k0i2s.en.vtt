because it's actually even heavier than

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
can also use it that way as well and I

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.420 
can also use it that way as well and I
usually<00:00:50.369> do<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.699> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.970> shower<00:00:51.180> personally

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
usually do it in the shower personally

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.619 
usually do it in the shower personally
because<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.549> know<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.059> doesn't<00:00:54.180> strip<00:00:54.479> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
because you know it doesn't strip the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
because you know it doesn't strip the
natural<00:00:54.989> oils<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.650> skin<00:00:56.040> or<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.580> hair

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.530 
to use hot water from the tap you can
use<00:02:00.750> boiled<00:02:01.080> hot<00:02:01.470> water<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:03.090> filtered

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
use boiled hot water or like filtered

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.930 
use boiled hot water or like filtered
hot<00:02:03.780> water<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.640> preference

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
hot water it's up to your preference

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.789 
hot water it's up to your preference
even<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> herbal<00:02:07.049> tea<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.470> want<00:02:07.650> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
even like a herbal tea if you want to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.380 
even like a herbal tea if you want to
just<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> liquid<00:02:08.759> ass<00:02:08.909> actually

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
just make sure the liquid ass actually

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410 
just make sure the liquid ass actually
has<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.659> be<00:02:09.690> very<00:02:10.110> hot<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.129> absorbs<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
has to be very hot so that absorbs to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:38.260 
has to be very hot so that absorbs to
the<00:02:12.720> clay

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.810 

if<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.480> add<00:02:39.660> too<00:02:40.050> much<00:02:40.320> water<00:02:40.620> it'll<00:02:41.430> be<00:02:41.550> too

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
if you add too much water it'll be too

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.840 
if you add too much water it'll be too
runny<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.600> easier<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.680> start<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.190> water

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
runny it's easier to start with water

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.450 
runny it's easier to start with water
just<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.420> level<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.860> clay<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
just that level of the of the clay and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.100 
just that level of the of the clay and
then<00:02:47.850> let<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> absorb<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.050> see

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
then let it absorb it as you can see

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.170 
then let it absorb it as you can see
look<00:02:49.470> how<00:02:49.560> fast<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.040> absorbs<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.520> water<00:02:50.730> there

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
look how fast it absorbs the water there

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.990 
look how fast it absorbs the water there
we<00:02:51.240> go<00:02:51.420> see<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> water<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.200> absorbing<00:02:53.010> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
we go see that water just absorbing just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.130 
we go see that water just absorbing just
disappearing<00:02:55.940> yeah<00:02:56.940> let<00:02:57.210> her<00:02:57.300> absorb<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.960> and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
disappearing yeah let her absorb it and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.620 
disappearing yeah let her absorb it and
it<00:02:58.560> takes<00:02:58.740> about<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.220> maybe<00:03:00.090> three<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.600> five

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
it takes about like maybe three to five

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.180 
it takes about like maybe three to five
minutes<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.410> depending<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.890> how<00:03:01.950> much

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
minutes just depending on how much

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.420 
minutes just depending on how much
you're<00:03:02.370> mixing<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:04.280> put<00:03:05.280> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you're mixing up really and put this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.690 
you're mixing up really and put this
back<00:03:05.670> down<00:03:08.690> good<00:03:10.370> look<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:14.100> basically<00:03:14.250> just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
back down good look you basically just

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.800 
back down good look you basically just
let<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.350> absorb<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:19.550> excuse<00:03:20.550> me<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.660> fall

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
let that absorb it excuse me but to fall

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.530 
let that absorb it excuse me but to fall
right<00:03:21.990> into<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.500> mud<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.580> basically<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.480> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
right into the mud so basically this is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
right into the mud so basically this is
how<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.840> mix<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.560> up<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.920> let<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.220> absorb<00:03:26.459> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
how you mix it up and let that absorb it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.449 
how you mix it up and let that absorb it
those<00:03:27.420> are<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> hot<00:03:28.200> water<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.770> can<00:03:29.310> add

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
those are all the hot water you can add

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.040 
those are all the hot water you can add
different<00:03:29.670> worlds<00:03:30.120> as<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.330> was<00:03:30.450> mentioning<00:03:30.660> tea

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
really careful with that like for this

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.800 
really careful with that like for this
amount<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.190> about<00:03:59.400> 200<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.420> bit

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
amount this is about 200 this is a bit

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.590 
amount this is about 200 this is a bit
of<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.080> larger<00:04:01.920> amount<00:04:02.239> let's<00:04:03.239> see<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.480> was<00:04:03.570> a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
of a larger amount let's see it was a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.229 
of a larger amount let's see it was a
hundred<00:04:03.989> gram<00:04:04.140> package<00:04:04.680> I'd<00:04:05.430> only<00:04:05.670> add<00:04:05.910> about

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
hundred gram package I'd only add about

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.030 
hundred gram package I'd only add about
maybe<00:04:06.450> half<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.959> teaspoon<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.650> oil<00:04:08.540> maybe<00:04:09.540> even

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
maybe half a teaspoon of oil maybe even

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.040 
maybe half a teaspoon of oil maybe even
you<00:04:11.040> half<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.400> teaspoon<00:04:11.820> usually<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.690> would<00:04:12.810> be

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
you half a teaspoon usually it would be

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.170 
you half a teaspoon usually it would be
enough<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.489> see<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.790> practically

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
enough as you can see it practically

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.570 
enough as you can see it practically
absorbed<00:04:15.690> all<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.320> water<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.310> still<00:04:17.400> a

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
absorbed all that water it's still a

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.560 
absorbed all that water it's still a
little<00:04:18.260> runny<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.650> getting<00:04:19.980> there<00:04:20.570> it's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
little runny but it's getting there it's

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.600 
little runny but it's getting there it's
getting<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:21.959> let<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:22.320> absorb<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:23.100> bit

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
getting there just let it absorb a bit

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.010 
getting there just let it absorb a bit
more<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:25.169> water<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.510> like<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.930> a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
more that water I like to see of a

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.240 
more that water I like to see of a
temperature<00:04:28.530> usually<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.070> make<00:04:29.220> sure

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
temperature usually just to make sure

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.280 
temperature usually just to make sure
it's<00:04:29.640> all

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
it's all
