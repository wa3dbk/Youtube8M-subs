you know he's at 97 now with the game

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.710 
you know he's at 97 now with the game
changing<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.500> soberness<00:06:04.800> is<00:06:05.160> higher<00:06:05.540> jump<00:06:06.540> is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
changing and soberness is higher jump is

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.860 
changing and soberness is higher jump is
higher<00:06:06.960> and<00:06:08.270> then<00:06:09.980> that<00:06:10.980> makes<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:12.360> think

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
higher and then that makes I think

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.240 
higher and then that makes I think
everybody<00:06:13.230> that's<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.500> same<00:06:13.710> i<00:06:13.740> picked<00:06:14.100> up

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
everybody that's the same i picked up

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.220 
everybody that's the same i picked up
the<00:06:14.840> team<00:06:15.840> captain<00:06:16.320> tyron<00:06:16.920> smith<00:06:17.810> he<00:06:18.810> has<00:06:18.930> to

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
the team captain tyron smith he has to

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.020 
the team captain tyron smith he has to
one<00:06:19.440> block<00:06:19.770> in<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:20.130> reason<00:06:20.460> why<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.610> got<00:06:20.850> him

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
one block in the reason why I got him

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.360 
one block in the reason why I got him
because<00:06:21.690> he<00:06:21.840> has<00:06:21.990> some<00:06:22.200> good<00:06:22.230> stats<00:06:22.710> itself

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
because he has some good stats itself

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.330 
because he has some good stats itself
but<00:06:23.700> also<00:06:23.820> i<00:06:24.150> use<00:06:24.600> DeMarco<00:06:25.440> Murray<00:06:25.680> as<00:06:25.950> my

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
but also i use DeMarco Murray as my

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.270 
but also i use DeMarco Murray as my
fullback<00:06:26.790> and<00:06:27.120> so<00:06:27.960> it<00:06:28.230> helps<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.680> have<00:06:28.710> extra

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
fullback and so it helps to have extra

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.760 
fullback and so it helps to have extra
one<00:06:29.490> block<00:06:29.760> for<00:06:30.000> him<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.450> then<00:06:31.170> I'm<00:06:31.380> Jamaal

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
one block for him and then I'm Jamaal

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.260 
one block for him and then I'm Jamaal
Charles<00:06:31.800> with<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.610> game<00:06:32.820> changes<00:06:33.390> he's<00:06:34.170> 99

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
Charles with the game changes he's 99

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.120 
Charles with the game changes he's 99
speed<00:06:36.270> so<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.990> mean<00:06:37.350> dude<00:06:37.620> is

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
speed so I mean dude is

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.120 
speed so I mean dude is
so<00:06:40.130> cease<00:06:40.430> 99<00:06:41.030> speed<00:06:41.449> now<00:06:42.380> with<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.919> game

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
so cease 99 speed now with the game

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.040 
so cease 99 speed now with the game
changes<00:06:43.669> and<00:06:44.240> then<00:06:44.419> I<00:06:44.539> think<00:06:44.780> that's<00:06:44.930> pretty

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
changes and then I think that's pretty

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.439 
changes and then I think that's pretty
much<00:06:45.320> it<00:06:45.380> that<00:06:45.889> changed<00:06:46.430> I'm<00:06:47.120> checking<00:06:47.360> the

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
much it that changed I'm checking the

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.480 
much it that changed I'm checking the
defense<00:06:49.120> they<00:06:50.120> still<00:06:50.389> have<00:06:50.600> the<00:06:50.900> I<00:06:51.080> guess<00:06:51.380> the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
defense they still have the I guess the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.140 
defense they still have the I guess the
most<00:06:52.490> feared<00:06:52.900> upgrades<00:06:53.900> on<00:06:54.199> there<00:06:54.490> I<00:06:55.490> don't

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
most feared upgrades on there I don't

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.620 
most feared upgrades on there I don't
think<00:06:56.210> nothing<00:06:56.600> has<00:06:56.690> changed<00:06:57.050> on<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.259> defense

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
think nothing has changed on the defense

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.990 
think nothing has changed on the defense
I<00:06:59.630> got<00:07:00.110> I<00:07:00.139> got<00:07:00.229> rid<00:07:00.620> of<00:07:00.650> a<00:07:00.770> Patrick<00:07:01.460> Peterson

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
I got I got rid of a Patrick Peterson

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.029 
I got I got rid of a Patrick Peterson
game<00:07:02.300> changer<00:07:02.780> because<00:07:02.840> he<00:07:03.110> was<00:07:03.289> uh<00:07:03.320> he<00:07:03.530> was

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880 
adding like to tackle to the team but

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.480 
adding like to tackle to the team but
taking<00:07:08.270> away<00:07:08.449> one<00:07:08.660> speed<00:07:09.020> and<00:07:09.410> I<00:07:09.590> didn't<00:07:10.370> like
