00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.519
 hello dear friends will take you 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.769
 Today is a great day for my channel 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.809
 videos will appear on the channel now 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.030
 dedicated only to strike strike 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.950
 that this game is much popular 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.420
 rather than battlefield but in this guide we 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.190
 consider the gun and where 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.080
 so 9 semi automatic pistol 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.030
 who first appeared in 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.100
 counter-strike go and will be available 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.030
 exclusively to terrorists in the game 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.879
 the store can be replaced with 75 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.350
 so 9 is a swedish american gun 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.120
 which uses classic 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.249
 9mm parabellum 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.980
 popularly this gun got its name 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.600
 nail puller due to its appearance for 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.059
 opening the gun you need 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.219
 throw the store 500 dollars 100 years 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.769
 great for eco rounds due 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.469
 high damage and huge shop on 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.690
 32 threshold temp firing characteristics 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.659
 500 rounds per minute damage when 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.170
 hitting the head tec-9 blows 132 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.320
 health units with a helmet 119 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 when hit in chest or hands blows off 33 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.079
 percent health recharge passes 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.450
 for 2.5 seconds so 9 has a huge 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.920
 number of pluses for example it has 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
 the largest store in the classroom 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 pistols he 32 cartridge even 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.939
 some submachine guns can't 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200
 boast of such a number is incredible 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.469
 high damage for 9mm 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.299
 gun and which allows vanshotyt 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.240
 adversary and even if he dressed kevlar and 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.700
 even in terms of saving t9 good 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 option and how it costs only 500 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.719
 dollars for this amount you get very 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.289
 powerful high-speed pistol 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.630
 firing 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.659
 good speed reload minus 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.640
 so 9 is also enough firstly it 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.799
 high returns which control 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.259
 it is possible but there is a pistol class 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.229
 better options secondly is the variation 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.259
 it's very difficult to make that one 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.659
 so 9 can rightly be called the most oblique 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.850
 gun in the game and third absolutely 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.230
 0 long distance accuracy for 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 such distances are better to take the recipe 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.250
 module from modules strongly 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.530
 I recommend to put the sensor stattrek 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.690
 which will add a little bit of your meaning 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 killing will add a couple of cents to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 value on the marketplace steam 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.810
 lard moron so 9 in a series of games 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 counter-strike seemed successful you 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.610
 got a very strong gun which 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.730
 requires you to control 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.400
 scatter 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.830
 59 may not be the most accurate one 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.940
 effective counter-strike pistol but 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.760
 I think that's all 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 in the next issue we will look at azimov 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.030
 and vp 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.470
 I also wish everyone a pleasant April 1 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 see you on the battlefield bye
