oregon mike tell us about this nice

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.400 
oregon mike tell us about this nice
titanium<00:00:12.459> road<00:00:13.240> bike<00:00:13.450> you<00:00:13.629> got<00:00:13.660> here<00:00:13.960> and<00:00:14.080> the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
titanium road bike you got here and the

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.470 
titanium road bike you got here and the
nice<00:00:14.589> shaping<00:00:15.339> of<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.639> tubing<00:00:16.059> right<00:00:16.270> here

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
nice shaping of the tubing right here

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.409 
nice shaping of the tubing right here
too<00:00:16.689> so<00:00:17.080> this<00:00:17.320> tie<00:00:17.619> bike<00:00:17.919> i<00:00:18.520> guess<00:00:19.270> i<00:00:19.360> would

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
too so this tie bike i guess i would

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.000 
too so this tie bike i guess i would
take<00:00:19.750> a<00:00:19.840> step<00:00:20.050> back<00:00:20.200> and<00:00:20.230> say<00:00:20.529> that<00:00:20.710> all<00:00:20.890> the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
take a step back and say that all the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.710 
take a step back and say that all the
bikes<00:00:21.189> that<00:00:21.369> I<00:00:21.430> make<00:00:21.730> are<00:00:21.910> made<00:00:22.090> to<00:00:22.210> order<00:00:22.539> and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
bikes that I make are made to order and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.200 
bikes that I make are made to order and
a<00:00:23.680> lot<00:00:23.859> of<00:00:23.980> times<00:00:24.160> maybe<00:00:24.429> builders<00:00:24.880> don't

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
a lot of times maybe builders don't

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.349 
a lot of times maybe builders don't
introduce<00:00:25.720> new<00:00:26.500> models<00:00:27.010> per<00:00:27.250> se<00:00:27.490> but<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.179> would

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
introduce new models per se but I would

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.480 
introduce new models per se but I would
say<00:00:28.480> that<00:00:28.509> this<00:00:28.779> particular<00:00:29.199> bike<00:00:29.590> would

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
say that this particular bike would

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.759 
say that this particular bike would
maybe<00:00:30.939> fit<00:00:31.240> in<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.420> realm<00:00:31.630> for<00:00:31.929> me<00:00:32.080> of<00:00:32.230> kind<00:00:32.619> of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
maybe fit in the realm for me of kind of

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.350 
maybe fit in the realm for me of kind of
a<00:00:32.830> new<00:00:33.010> model<00:00:33.400> it's<00:00:33.519> got<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.670> few<00:00:33.879> things<00:00:34.120> going

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
a new model it's got a few things going

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.930 
a new model it's got a few things going
on<00:00:34.570> front<00:00:35.230> triangle<00:00:35.530> is<00:00:35.739> all<00:00:35.949> butted<00:00:36.339> titanium

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
on front triangle is all butted titanium

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.810 
on front triangle is all butted titanium
with<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.989> shape<00:00:38.260> down<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.250> then<00:00:39.699> we've

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
with the shape down to and then we've

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.030 
with the shape down to and then we've
also<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.659> lot<00:00:41.019> of<00:00:41.140> people<00:00:41.409> are<00:00:41.500> doing<00:00:41.769> it<00:00:41.890> but<00:00:41.979> I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
also a lot of people are doing it but I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.100 
also a lot of people are doing it but I
did<00:00:42.220> find<00:00:42.400> then<00:00:42.580> go<00:00:42.670> ahead<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.110> incorporate

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
did find then go ahead and incorporate

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.570 
did find then go ahead and incorporate
the<00:00:44.489> integrated<00:00:45.489> seat<00:00:45.699> mass<00:00:45.909> I<00:00:46.330> say<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.309> what

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
the integrated seat mass I say and what

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.340 
the integrated seat mass I say and what
advantages<00:00:49.269> do<00:00:49.659> you<00:00:49.780> think<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.170> this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
advantages do you think that this

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.640 
advantages do you think that this
provides<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.430> bike<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.479> what<00:00:52.720> what<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.470> lot

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
provides to the bike so what what a lot

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.340 
provides to the bike so what what a lot
of<00:00:53.680> people<00:00:53.830> are<00:00:54.449> appreciating<00:00:55.449> about<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
of people are appreciating about it the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.560 
of people are appreciating about it the
reason<00:00:56.470> we're<00:00:56.739> seeing<00:00:56.979> it<00:00:57.159> so<00:00:57.339> much<00:00:57.580> is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
reason we're seeing it so much is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.299 
reason we're seeing it so much is
because<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:59.170> know<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.379> riders<00:00:59.680> are<00:00:59.799> liking

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
because you know the riders are liking

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.539 
because you know the riders are liking
the<00:01:00.400> feedback<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.890> dare<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.920> say<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.280> but<00:01:03.519> I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
the feedback and dare I say it but I

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:04.590 
the feedback and dare I say it but I
think<00:01:03.580> a<00:01:03.760> lot<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.909> people<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.420> way<00:01:04.510> it

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
think a lot of people like the way it

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.350 
think a lot of people like the way it
looks<00:01:04.629> as<00:01:04.930> well<00:01:05.170> style<00:01:05.799> sure<00:01:06.640> no<00:01:06.909> problem<00:01:07.150> with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
looks as well style sure no problem with

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.630 
looks as well style sure no problem with
that<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.810> how<00:01:08.439> about<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.100> shaping<00:01:09.340> of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
that and how about the the shaping of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.279 
that and how about the the shaping of
this<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:11.200> do<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.409> decide<00:01:11.740> where<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.520> start

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
this how do you decide where to start

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.169 
this how do you decide where to start
fattening<00:01:14.289> it<00:01:14.439> out<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.219> taper<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.969> will

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
fattening it out the taper on that will

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.789 
fattening it out the taper on that will
obviously<00:01:16.630> what<00:01:17.109> we're<00:01:17.259> looking<00:01:17.560> for<00:01:17.590> here

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
obviously what we're looking for here

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.709 
obviously what we're looking for here
this<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> very<00:01:18.609> big<00:01:18.850> tube<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:19.329> an<00:01:19.420> inch<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
this is a very big tube it's an inch and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.510 
this is a very big tube it's an inch and
three-quarter<00:01:20.109> juice<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:21.039> what<00:01:21.219> we<00:01:21.310> need<00:01:21.429> to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
three-quarter juice so what we need to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.800 
three-quarter juice so what we need to
do<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.759> we<00:01:21.850> need<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.090> connect<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.570> our<00:01:22.600> head

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
do is we need to connect it to our head

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.450 
do is we need to connect it to our head
tube<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.109> need<00:01:23.259> to<00:01:23.350> connect<00:01:23.890> at<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.130> bottom
