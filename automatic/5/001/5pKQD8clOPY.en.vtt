00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
this aspect into consideration at all I

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.039 
this aspect into consideration at all I
think<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.220> only<00:03:42.370> heard<00:03:42.729> two<00:03:43.090> lines<00:03:43.389> of<00:03:43.569> dialogue

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
that even remotely addressed this fact I

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.719 
that even remotely addressed this fact I
found<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.409> be<00:03:47.440> pretty<00:03:47.829> disappointing
