minute and I will show you the seed pods
on<00:00:34.239> this<00:00:34.559> eucalyptus<00:00:35.559> branch<00:00:36.550> here<00:00:37.440> each<00:00:38.440> seed

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
on this eucalyptus branch here each seed

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.460 
on this eucalyptus branch here each seed
pod<00:00:39.040> contains<00:00:39.550> hundreds<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.120> dust-like<00:00:40.870> seeds

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
pod contains hundreds of dust-like seeds

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.280 
pod contains hundreds of dust-like seeds
so<00:00:42.460> each<00:00:42.879> year<00:00:43.150> I<00:00:43.210> harvest<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.809> seed<00:00:44.019> and<00:00:44.229> I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
so each year I harvest the seed and I

happening I did have to cut this because

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.759 
happening I did have to cut this because
it<00:00:55.659> was<00:00:55.750> getting<00:00:55.989> too<00:00:56.080> close<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.440> some<00:00:56.589> of<00:00:56.710> the

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
it was getting too close to some of the

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.619 
it was getting too close to some of the
powerlines<00:00:57.250> out<00:00:57.820> at<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.119> end<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.330> one<00:00:58.449> of<00:00:58.540> my

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
powerlines out at the end of one of my

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.079 
powerlines out at the end of one of my
driveways<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.129> top<00:01:00.339> power<00:01:00.610> line<00:01:00.879> has<00:01:00.909> a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
driveways and that top power line has a

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.160 
driveways and that top power line has a
lot<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.390> juice<00:01:01.540> going<00:01:01.720> through<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.110> I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
lot of juice going through it and I

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.359 
lot of juice going through it and I
don't<00:01:02.229> want<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.500> start<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.769> fire

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
don't want to start a fire

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.219 
don't want to start a fire
this<00:01:03.729> thing<00:01:03.970> brushes<00:01:04.510> up<00:01:04.629> against<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.110> it

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
this thing brushes up against it it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.069 
this thing brushes up against it it
would<00:01:05.350> probably<00:01:05.379> explode<00:01:06.159> into<00:01:06.460> flames

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
would probably explode into flames

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.569 
would probably explode into flames
eucalyptus<00:01:08.079> trees<00:01:08.320> are<00:01:08.439> very<00:01:08.590> oily<00:01:08.829> so<00:01:09.430> this

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
eucalyptus trees are very oily so this

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.249 
eucalyptus trees are very oily so this
is<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> eucalyptus<00:01:10.270> parent<00:01:10.659> II<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:10.960> grew<00:01:11.200> it

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
is a eucalyptus parent II and I grew it

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.889 
is a eucalyptus parent II and I grew it
from<00:01:11.439> seed<00:01:11.680> years<00:01:12.070> ago<00:01:12.689> seed<00:01:13.689> that<00:01:13.840> I

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
from seed years ago seed that I

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.120 
from seed years ago seed that I
collected<00:01:14.170> from<00:01:14.289> a<00:01:14.439> local<00:01:14.740> tree<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.070> was

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
collected from a local tree that was

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.389 
collected from a local tree that was
planted<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.609> 1971<00:01:16.679> another<00:01:17.679> common<00:01:18.219> name<00:01:18.250> for

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
this tree is a spinning gum it's got

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.190 
this tree is a spinning gum it's got
beautiful<00:01:21.219> leaves<00:01:21.670> on<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.840> here's<00:01:23.049> the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
overall branch that I cut off from the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.760 
overall branch that I cut off from the
top<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.600> tree

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
top of the tree

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.010

these<00:01:31.170> seed<00:01:31.439> capsules<00:01:32.340> off<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:32.939> there

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
these seed capsules off because there

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.800 
these seed capsules off because there
are<00:01:33.179> hordes<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:35.149> you<00:01:36.149> have<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> top<00:01:36.600> now

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
then after they've opened and formed

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.919 
then after they've opened and formed
flowers<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:08.220> develop<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.970> seed<00:02:09.209> pods<00:02:09.539> or

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
flowers they develop into seed pods or
