this little thing really tiny its kind
of<00:04:40.040> painted<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.670> guess<00:04:41.270> as<00:04:41.420> best<00:04:41.660> as<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.840> could<00:04:41.900> do

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
of painted I guess as best as I could do

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.600 
of painted I guess as best as I could do
for<00:04:42.110> something<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:42.650> small<00:04:42.680> which<00:04:43.280> isn't<00:04:43.580> bad

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
for something so small which isn't bad

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.320 
for something so small which isn't bad
and<00:04:45.250> also<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.460> get<00:04:46.610> like<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.940> guess<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:47.270> a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
and also you get like I guess it's a

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.090 
and also you get like I guess it's a
little<00:04:47.360> yellow<00:04:47.750> jacket<00:04:48.170> he's<00:04:48.770> cut<00:04:48.980> these

like<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.630> said<00:04:59.870> I<00:04:59.900> think<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.200> weird<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.530> they

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
like I said I think it's weird that they

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.460 
like I said I think it's weird that they
included<00:05:01.850> Ultron<00:05:02.180> with<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.510> set<00:05:02.780> seems<00:05:03.320> like

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
included Ultron with this set seems like

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.520 
included Ultron with this set seems like
he<00:05:03.590> should<00:05:03.800> have<00:05:03.890> been<00:05:04.040> with<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:05.120> know<00:05:05.240> the

he should have been with you know the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.430 
he should have been with you know the
Avengers<00:05:06.530> 2<00:05:06.770> figures<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:08.030> whatever<00:05:08.390> it's<00:05:09.290> cool
