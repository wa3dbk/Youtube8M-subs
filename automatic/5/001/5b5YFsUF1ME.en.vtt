00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
think that is the I'm not sure if that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.159 
think that is the I'm not sure if that
is<00:01:28.859> stock<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:30.349> since<00:01:31.349> the<00:01:31.590> since<00:01:33.169> an

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:34.169 
is stock or not since the since an

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:36.589 
is stock or not since the since an
aftermarket<00:01:34.789> exhaust<00:01:35.789> has<00:01:35.969> been<00:01:36.119> added<00:01:36.479> I'm

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
aftermarket exhaust has been added I'm

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.969 
aftermarket exhaust has been added I'm
not<00:01:36.719> sure<00:01:36.899> if<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.459> rejected<00:01:39.149> or<00:01:39.419> not

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
not sure if it was rejected or not

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.779 
not sure if it was rejected or not
anyway<00:01:40.979> um<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.989> the<00:01:43.979> idle<00:01:44.279> jet<00:01:44.489> on<00:01:44.609> this

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
anyway um the this the idle jet on this

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.469 
anyway um the this the idle jet on this
side<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> pretty<00:01:47.039> pretty<00:01:47.579> clogged<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.209> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
side was a pretty pretty clogged up I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
side was a pretty pretty clogged up I
clean<00:01:49.109> it<00:01:49.319> out<00:01:49.409> everything<00:01:49.859> is<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.249> it's<00:01:50.489> got

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
clean it out everything is good it's got

clean it out everything is good it's got
a<00:01:50.639> it's<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:50.999> a<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.299> flow<00:01:51.539> now<00:01:52.340> what<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> did<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
a it's got a good flow now what I did is

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.569 
a it's got a good flow now what I did is
get<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.649> carburetor<00:01:55.649> cleaner<00:01:55.889> there<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
get the carburetor cleaner there and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.669 
get the carburetor cleaner there and
just<00:01:56.729> soak<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:57.929> about<00:01:58.139> 15-20

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
just soak it in there for about 15-20

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.620 
just soak it in there for about 15-20
minutes<00:01:59.279> and<00:01:59.489> then<00:02:01.039> put<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.779> put<00:02:03.779> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
minutes and then put the put the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.809 
minutes and then put the put the
I<00:02:06.240> pinched<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.590> jet<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.340> nozzle

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
I pinched the the the jet the nozzle

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.990 
I pinched the the the jet the nozzle
here<00:02:10.300> put<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> Jets<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:12.000> pressure

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
here put on the Jets and then pressure

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.809 
here put on the Jets and then pressure
it<00:02:13.239> with<00:02:13.450> my<00:02:13.630> fingers<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:15.489> pressure

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
it with my fingers and then to pressure

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.140 
it with my fingers and then to pressure
to<00:02:16.360> create<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.310> little<00:02:18.310> seal<00:02:18.519> there<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
to create a little seal there and just

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.960 
to create a little seal there and just
and<00:02:19.420> fired<00:02:19.900> away<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> good<00:02:21.700> flow

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and fired away so it's got a good flow

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.320 
and fired away so it's got a good flow
now<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.980> right<00:02:24.160> side<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.550> pretty<00:02:24.790> clogged<00:02:25.090> up

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
now the right side was pretty clogged up

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.770 
now the right side was pretty clogged up
the<00:02:25.540> left<00:02:25.750> side<00:02:25.989> wasn't<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.920> bad<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.630> was<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the left side wasn't as bad but it was a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
the left side wasn't as bad but it was a
it<00:02:29.080> wasn't<00:02:29.700> flowing<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.599> should<00:02:31.900> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it wasn't flowing as it should so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.240 
it wasn't flowing as it should so
hopefully<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.519> will<00:02:33.760> resolve<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.950> solve

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
hopefully this will resolve it we solve

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.030 
hopefully this will resolve it we solve
the<00:02:36.400> UH<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:37.000> idle<00:02:37.870> issue<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.410> back

firing and the popping him all that
noise<00:02:44.580> anyway<00:02:45.580> I'm<00:02:45.970> gonna<00:02:46.180> put<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.840> together

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
noise anyway I'm gonna put it together

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.640 
noise anyway I'm gonna put it together
and<00:02:47.940> put<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.290> bike<00:02:50.470> and

and put it back on the on the bike and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.849 
and put it back on the on the bike and
