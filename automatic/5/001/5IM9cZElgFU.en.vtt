EP as you can see here I wanted a
separate<00:01:10.930> hayloft<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.039> I<00:01:12.070> installed<00:01:12.369> some

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
separate hayloft so I installed some

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.899 
separate hayloft so I installed some
extra<00:01:13.539> grids<00:01:13.899> which<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:15.039> be<00:01:15.220> removed<00:01:15.610> for

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909

extra grids which can be removed for
cleaning<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:17.350> also<00:01:18.039> makes<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.430> easier<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.939> lock

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330

i<00:01:28.860> use<00:01:29.860> cage<00:01:30.429> liners<00:01:31.119> since<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.630> few<00:01:31.659> years<00:01:31.899> as

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
i use cage liners since a few years as

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.919 
i use cage liners since a few years as
they<00:01:33.159> are<00:01:33.280> easier<00:01:33.729> than<00:01:33.789> fleas<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.509> cotton

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.309 
they are easier than fleas and cotton
towel<00:01:35.229> material<00:01:36.009> underneath<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.049> same

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
towel material underneath it's the same

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.949

together my cage liners even have fleas

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.430 
together my cage liners even have fleas
on<00:01:44.679> both<00:01:44.920> sides<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.209> I<00:01:46.240> can<00:01:46.450> flip<00:01:46.690> them<00:01:46.929> after<00:01:47.409> a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
on both sides so I can flip them after a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.370 
on both sides so I can flip them after a
few<00:01:47.770> days<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:49.090> keeps<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.659> pigs<00:01:49.929> cleaner

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380
