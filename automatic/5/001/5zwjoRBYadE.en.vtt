00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.069
 hello this is the first attempt to make 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.069
 an xy scanner 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.700
 a kind of laser projector 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.070
 and so 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.390
 I just put it together right now 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.260
 trying to draw a square 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.260
 slowly 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.310
 and well you can see that 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.990
 they have very good results because it is 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.079
 quite irregular I will increase the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.429
 drawing speed 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.429
 That 's right, I'm saying 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.590
 increase 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 good 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.610
 as soon as the increase too much since 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.400
 nothing comes out 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.800
 when I'm going to reduce it, it looks more 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.070
 or less the square shape 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.730
 but you see the rebound of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.300
 but brothers meters 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.280
 as slower 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 well it's not that much better 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.370
 and well let's see 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.030
 turn on the light to explain the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.030
 circuit 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.610
 Let's see 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.020
 in the circuit 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.530
 is here is controlled with an arduino 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.470
 now I explain the parts 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:46.150
 and the key of the scanner is here 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.000
 On the one hand we have this plate that is 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.930
 a hard drive three and a half here we see 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.930
 the reading head 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.240
 I have stuck a mirror with silicone 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.240
 to do the address x 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.130
 of the reading head comes out this tape 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.130
 cables and me here 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.600
 I soldier to the thicker drivers 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.360
 every day because they should be the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.860
 coil feed and so it is 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.850
 and then this other the other mirror to another 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.140
 address I made it with another disk 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.959
 I'm hard here 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.540
 that is from an ipod this is 18 inches 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.680
 a hard drive that had broken here we see 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.700
 the reading head also of the ipod 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.470
 in this case the feed the extracted 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.490
 of the connector that was the point where 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.490
 I could better weld 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.460
 also stuck with silicone 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.110
 a mirror to do the other direction and 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.110
 then here is 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.159
 the lage module 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.660
 weak and that I have stuck with putty 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:13.010
 of this a repair putty 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 so 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.689
 here on the other hand I have two 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.310
 potentiometers for each coordinates this 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.629
 for the x coordinate is for the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 coordinate ai and with this with this a 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:33.230
 potentiometer 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.770
 fixed the limits of the square of each 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.540
 coordinate for example let's see 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.510
 for example here I'm going to open the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.760
 coordinate x and should be done at 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.010
 bigger and bigger square in that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.600
 coordinate 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.550
 here you do not notice much and sometimes 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.880
 m 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.460
 here you see how that coordinate has 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.880
 increased a lot I'm going to slow it down 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.880
 why 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.200
 Of course that movement has a lot of rebound 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.010
 well I'm going to close it by both 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.010
 potentiometers 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.180
 Now I have it said 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.510
 has a lot of good rebound I have not commented 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.510
 that the reading heads 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.370
 in a system of retreat somewhat here 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.070
 and because it is a needle 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.080
 more or less but that's what I think 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.479
 what's the rebound 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.610
 in the case of the lay candle the 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.569
 recoil is given by the tape itself 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.569
 data 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.020
 well then I have the x coordinate the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.910
 two limits and the coordinate and the two 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.730
 limits also upper lower because 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.390
 in principle, you did not know how you were going to 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.430
 answer him 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.440
 the point of the mirrors 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.140
 good 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.050
 On the other hand, the only interesting thing is 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.259
 that this is the potentiometer that fixes me 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:16.030
 the delay between each position here 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.030
 you reduced the delay here is the increase 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.529
 Moreover amplifier theme this one 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.289
 H bridge 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.139
 what helps me to amplify the signal in 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.980
 current of the signal that goes to 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:34.700
 Three and a half hard disk barometer 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.250
 because it is what the arduino supplies 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.080
 by analog or pseudo outputs 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.490
 Analog analogue simulations 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.190
 digital 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.199
 is here the 2 and 3 is not 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.349
 enough current to move the 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:52.729
 coil with relative strength in the case of 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.090
 the ipod coil as it is smallest 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.280
 if it is enough with the current that gives 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.590
 the exit the pin 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.750
 simulated analog of the ruin 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.010
 and good a little more 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.010
 It is the first attempt 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.800
 and let's see let's put it more quickly 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.510
 for now it does not have much precision I have 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.249
 to solve the bounce issue 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.499
 and doing 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:37.000
 is continuously on could 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:40.420
 have made an exit too 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.870
 that is to give the points in a discreet way 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.460
 but good for now that I think the 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.440
 links get hot when turned on 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.610
 and it turns off I prefer to leave it 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.610
 continuously on 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:58.210
 he's a skunk but to begin with 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.210
 all sir I'm happy
