00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
they used to be in since I've been

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.400 
they used to be in since I've been
playing<00:02:10.390> since<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> beginning<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> game

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
playing since the beginning of the game

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.250 
playing since the beginning of the game
since<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> first<00:02:12.340> came<00:02:12.520> out<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:13.060> remember<00:02:14.020> when

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
since it first came out I remember when

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.510 
since it first came out I remember when
the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.980 
the
I used<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.090> really<00:02:16.240> good<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.720> then<00:02:16.870> they

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
I used to be really good and then they

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.530 
I used to be really good and then they
got<00:02:17.140> weak<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:18.490> because<00:02:18.790> healers<00:02:19.240> used

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
got weak and it was because healers used

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.120 
got weak and it was because healers used
to<00:02:19.630> target<00:02:19.840> anything<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.740> was<00:02:20.830> close<00:02:21.100> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
to target anything that was close to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.620 
to target anything that was close to
them<00:02:21.430> rather<00:02:21.670> than<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.970> biggest<00:02:22.270> group<00:02:22.450> and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
them rather than the biggest group and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.860 
them rather than the biggest group and
that's<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.320> big<00:02:23.590> difference<00:02:23.800> guys<00:02:24.390> all<00:02:25.390> right

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that's a big difference guys all right

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.920 
that's a big difference guys all right
so<00:02:26.590> as<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.520> see<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.120> attacking<00:02:28.720> this

so as you can see we are attacking this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.260 
so as you can see we are attacking this
high<00:02:29.170> level<00:02:29.200> base<00:02:29.710> look<00:02:30.190> at<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.580> base<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.210> is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
high level base look at this base it is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.380 
high level base look at this base it is
got<00:02:31.750> oh<00:02:31.960> my<00:02:32.290> god<00:02:32.710> these<00:02:33.220> walls<00:02:33.520> are<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.150> high

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
got oh my god these walls are so high

got oh my god these walls are so high
level<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> space<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.560> well<00:02:36.100> done<00:02:36.610> now<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
level the space is so well done now it

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870 
level the space is so well done now it
is<00:02:37.660> not<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> maxed-out<00:02:38.410> base<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.610> one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
is not a maxed-out base it is like one

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.940 
is not a maxed-out base it is like one
level<00:02:40.210> below<00:02:40.330> max<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.020> cannons<00:02:41.770> and

that's about it and the walls are two

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.650 
that's about it and the walls are two
levels<00:02:45.040> below<00:02:45.280> max<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:45.970> still<00:02:46.270> they<00:02:46.510> are

we're gonna slowly slowly drop troops
around<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.320> base<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.860> finding<00:05:33.160> what

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
around the base just finding what

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.920 
around the base just finding what
buildings<00:05:33.640> we<00:05:33.700> can<00:05:33.820> pick<00:05:34.000> off<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.450> this<00:05:34.810> is

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
buildings we can pick off and this is

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.000 
buildings we can pick off and this is
where<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.110> need<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.290> do<00:05:35.350> at<00:05:35.470> high<00:05:35.560> levels<00:05:35.890> guys

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
where you need to do at high levels guys

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.040 
where you need to do at high levels guys
number<00:05:36.700> one<00:05:36.880> reason<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.480> lot<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.870> time

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
number one reason is that a lot of time

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.390 
number one reason is that a lot of time
you<00:05:38.170> could<00:05:38.260> pick<00:05:38.410> off<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.590> few<00:05:38.680> buildings<00:05:39.100> which

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
you could pick off a few buildings which

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.430 
you could pick off a few buildings which
is<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> couple<00:05:39.910> archers<00:05:40.270> before<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.230> have<00:05:41.350> to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
drop a major force down and also you

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.300 
drop a major force down and also you
don't<00:05:44.140> want<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.410> drop<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.620> huge<00:05:45.010> amount<00:05:45.250> of
