00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.580
 hello friends how are we good for them 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.370
 I bring as you can see in the title a 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.820
 small itunes card that has made us 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.640
 the favor of giving us a subscriber and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.239
 well still good I was thinking how 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 give it away and well I think that the way 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.390
 it's more fair that you decide to leave 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.680
 well the three options that I have is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.280
 give the whole card to a single winner 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.390
 give the cheapest games of 99 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 cents 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.120
 games two dollars or the card is ok 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 of 10 dollars we can see here that that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:00.809
 user mx x rx x 2 or is marked 2 that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.769
 here says card there is 10 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 dollar and ready and this already happened to me 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.420
 code that you can see and good 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
