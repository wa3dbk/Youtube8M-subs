the<00:05:10.210> next<00:05:10.509> step<00:05:10.719> will<00:05:10.930> be<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.110> let<00:05:11.469> this<00:05:11.620> dry

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
the next step will be to let this dry

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.830 
the next step will be to let this dry
out<00:05:12.039> a<00:05:12.069> little<00:05:12.219> bit<00:05:12.460> at<00:05:12.789> that<00:05:12.849> time<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.300> can<00:05:13.509> come

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840
