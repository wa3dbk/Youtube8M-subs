00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
going to be going over how to create a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.589 
going to be going over how to create a
simple<00:00:24.600> object<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> planes<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.680> also

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
simple object out of planes and also

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
simple object out of planes and also
create<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> simple<00:00:30.960> scene<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.790> because

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
create a simple scene as well because

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
create a simple scene as well because
later<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> animate<00:00:33.899> we're

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
later on we're going to animate we're

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
later on we're going to animate we're
going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> animate<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.760> camera<00:00:35.790> around<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
going to animate the camera around this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
going to animate the camera around this
object<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.590> create<00:00:37.920> within<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.489> scene

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
object that we create within the scene

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
object that we create within the scene
and<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.780> also<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.559> texture

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and we're also going to texture

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
and we're also going to texture
everything<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.210> hopefully<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
everything so hopefully that will this

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
everything so hopefully that will this
will<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> 2<00:00:44.899> video<00:00:45.899> series<00:00:47.090> not<00:00:48.090> too<00:00:48.210> sure

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
will be a 2 video series not too sure

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
will be a 2 video series not too sure
though<00:00:48.450> depends<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.579> goes

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
right I kind of make a curl a reason why

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.679 
right I kind of make a curl a reason why
we're<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> create<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.560> curl<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.689> because

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
we're going to create a curl is because

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.170 
we're going to create a curl is because
when<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> camera<00:01:55.950> working<00:01:56.460> around<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
when you do a camera working around it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.899 
when you do a camera working around it
it<00:01:57.270> looks<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.780> cool<00:01:58.579> plus<00:01:59.579> we're<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it looks really cool plus we're going to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.700 
it looks really cool plus we're going to
make<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> transparent<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.159> extent<00:02:02.579> and

make it transparent to an extent and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
make it transparent to an extent and
reflective<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.270> its<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.450> interesting

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
reflective and its really interesting

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
prove that it's got some depth to it as

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.150 
prove that it's got some depth to it as
you<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.049> there's<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.410> corner<00:03:16.950> right

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
there that doesn't have any depth but

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.560 
there that doesn't have any depth but
that's<00:03:19.530> fine<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.820> fix<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.360> by

that's fine you can fix that by
selecting<00:03:22.470> everything<00:03:23.160> extruding<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
selecting everything extruding and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
extrude on and it will add depth there

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.920 
extrude on and it will add depth there
we're<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.769> though<00:03:32.930> so

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
things sadly next we're going to add a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.550 
things sadly next we're going to add a
plane<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> ground<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.840> our<00:04:18.930> object<00:04:19.349> so

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
plane to be the ground for our object so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.670

while the sphere is still selected you
want<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.289> smooth<00:05:45.650> it<00:05:45.830> click<00:05:46.789> smooth<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.210> can

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
want to smooth it click smooth you can

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.670 
want to smooth it click smooth you can
also<00:05:47.449> subsurface<00:05:48.020> but<00:05:48.289> that's<00:05:48.440> kind<00:05:48.620> of

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
also subsurface but that's kind of

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.290 
also subsurface but that's kind of
wasting<00:05:49.130> a<00:05:49.570> memory<00:05:50.570> by<00:05:51.409> doing<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:53.060> that's

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
wasting a memory by doing that so that's

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.649 
wasting a memory by doing that so that's
basically<00:05:53.659> our<00:05:54.169> object<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:58.430> scene<00:05:58.699> the

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
basically our object and the scene the

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.330 
basically our object and the scene the
point<00:05:59.900> of<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.139> is<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:00.650> actually<00:06:00.800> do<00:06:01.159> some

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
point of this is to actually do some

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.249 
point of this is to actually do some
camera<00:06:01.669> rigging<00:06:02.060> where<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:02.720> take<00:06:03.229> your

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
camera rigging where you take your

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.480 
camera rigging where you take your
camera<00:06:03.620> move<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.699> around<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:05.150> object<00:06:05.380> and

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
camera move it around the object and

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.070 
camera move it around the object and
demonstrate<00:06:07.490> it<00:06:07.610> so<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.120> face<00:06:08.750> that<00:06:08.990> you

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
demonstrate it so the face that you

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.499 
demonstrate it so the face that you
created<00:06:09.409> in<00:06:09.650> my<00:06:09.830> sculpting<00:06:10.340> tutorial<00:06:10.550> you

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
created in my sculpting tutorial you

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.480 
created in my sculpting tutorial you
could<00:06:11.870> put<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.470> face<00:06:12.680> in<00:06:12.919> the<00:06:13.039> center<00:06:13.280> of<00:06:13.310> it

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
could put the face in the center of it

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.370 
could put the face in the center of it
put<00:06:13.849> it<00:06:14.000> on<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.120> pedestal<00:06:14.479> or<00:06:14.750> something<00:06:15.229> and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
put it on a pedestal or something and

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.089 
put it on a pedestal or something and
you<00:06:16.159> know<00:06:16.310> take<00:06:16.639> a<00:06:17.320> camera<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:18.440> rotate<00:06:19.070> it

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
you know take a camera and rotate it

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.640 
you know take a camera and rotate it
around<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.669> face<00:06:19.849> that<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.270> created<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:21.500> show

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
around the face that you created to show

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.510 
around the face that you created to show
it<00:06:21.800> off<00:06:22.900> or<00:06:23.900> if<00:06:24.289> you've<00:06:24.560> created<00:06:24.860> an<00:06:25.130> elaborate

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520
