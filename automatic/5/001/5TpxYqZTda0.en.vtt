00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.829
 This just the lower part of the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.600
 Around 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.870
 Beating 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 Well really it also To really but this side is what rough-hewn 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.180
 I'm hitting here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.180
 I would like to try what kind of sound does 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.719
 As a bad example eh post 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.990
 I'm thinking that my palm is open and my fingers open up 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.990
 Gone too open it is this kind of thing with this kind of this Toka not exposed to this below 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.350

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.109
 Poupe 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.210
 To complete this phrase finally 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.760
 I will introduce the techniques used here one by one 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.760
 Yun 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 hoop 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:02.430
 Then I will explain here the part that becomes very important here is the cold fish first only six strings 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.119
 It will be referred to as a hit 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.390
 So and it was I actually of here by pulling the center per hole roughly when drawn now to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.580
 Ne 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 On the neck 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.940
 And of course 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.069
 At close to those and this bridge hit at the hall 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.049

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.889

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.989

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.989
 The sound may be slightly different when you hit it 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.140
 me 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:57.190
