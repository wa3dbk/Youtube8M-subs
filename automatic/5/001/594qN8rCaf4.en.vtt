00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 but visit the carnival 's 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 great river the school that will bring 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 sold on the symbology of the letters of the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:20.189
 crazy pack to begin with 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 from the deck 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.330
 well there is not really an origin of the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.260
 Where did they come from? Where did they come from? 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.039
 huh 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.869
 there are several types of deck 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 supposedly from where they came from but 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 not if there is a certain place from where 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.910
 they came at what time he started 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.649
 to emerge and what is most interesting is 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.960
 of this plot that I will not tell the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.969
 story how the story deck came about 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 card by which he passed and which 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.829
 it's these decks I'm not going to talk about 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.829
 symbolism that the fall of the decks 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 and in this power struggle 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.520
 it is scattered many cats click there are many 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.860
 characters how has it happened? 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 division there we have these data 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.080
 we know the good is the deck and he 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.020
 it divides 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.570
 it splits in two moments the deck 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.530
 of fun and the divination deck 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.180
 The deck of fun are Jorge that today 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.560
 We already know games from day to day. 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.610
 king of those letters from your magnet 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.210
 games and divination games are the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.369
 cards that the fortune tellers play with the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 people is not that everyone wants to see what 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.950
 You'd better want it for your life, huh? 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.900
 among which is our most famous altar or 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.900
 marcelle and the gypsy deck 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.170

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.500
 I'm the one to combine 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 [Music] 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.590
 're in the band of the Teutonic 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 Parana coming to your living room 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 I did not mean to want but I saw that it was 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.660
 very colorful very vibrant part of the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.880
 fantasies even the car is very flashy 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.090
 but if you mess up all this colorful 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.190
 before talking about gypsy is always is always 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.590
 interesting then came an inspiration to 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.360
 more has many colors of joy and what 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.160
 I want to show in this sector. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.440
 I have a lot of joy, a lot of party. 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.230
 gypsies but in fact what will be 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.630
 shown on the avenue is a fantasy and a 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.060
 allegorical car will be the letters 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.700
 Gypsies and not one and not groups or 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.620
 Gypsy talk that even what you've had 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.690
 even a gypsy plot in some schools 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.390
 also talk in some sectors of gypsy 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.890
 death is to speak of the gypsy deck for 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.650
 that within the sector we will have the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.780
 heart letter the sun one letter 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.290
 Good morning revealed that astrology is 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.800
 inserted in this money is stronger than 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.900
 that the two suipes because we studied I 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.920
 roberto by the long was very important 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 the suits within the design and the 15 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.459
 natural elements for each suit 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.340
 exists the element is natural fire land 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.530
 air and water they are also governed by 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.760
 suits and by then I think I'm very 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.299
 interesting that few people 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.299
