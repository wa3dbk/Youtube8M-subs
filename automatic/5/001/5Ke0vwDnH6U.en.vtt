00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:12.010
 the amm 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.039
 over there 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 in this video I will talk about the act of 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:04.210
 fashions and also on the output of the notes 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.520
 what is the attack is how you 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.770
 going to drive the picks is a gimmick 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 that you will use to make the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 straws begin to vibrate 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 You can do this in several ways. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:30.179
 simple throat joint and also 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.179
 with the tongue and even with the simple sides 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.319
 and the note will start to vibrate 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.149
 gradually it will reach the point 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:52.500
 ideal of them at her speed 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 a slower attack 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.340
 you can make the attack with the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.950
 throat with throat in practice 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:03:57.920
 looks a lot like a crowd 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:04:02.709
 The same happens in the throat can can 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.709
 being relative depends on the taste of the world 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:18.250
 difference is subtle but the difference with 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.790
 the sides is mainly used with 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:47.370
 simultaneous chords as you play more than 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:47.370
 inferior and superior malo 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:32.290
 free and then free to interrupt 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:35.290
 of the then is equivalent to the attack 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.320
 It's simple you can interrupt with 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:46.930
 throat closes the throat 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:50.580
 after you just for you can 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.580
 stop new also with the language 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.960
 attacks and exits of the notes is 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.510
 important 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.890
 all of them for each situation is a 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.340
 attack an exit is better then starts 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:19.040
 try this 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:22.729
 already touches the skunk being the habit you go 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.090
 to stop having a one -note joint 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.479
 it is always the same homogeneous for 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.630
 get more texture your sound is this 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.630
 there
