good option like some fish so salmon or
whitefish<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:07.070> but<00:02:08.070> either<00:02:08.220> way

whitefish is really good but either way

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.580 
whitefish is really good but either way
you're<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.630> put<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.960> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> pan<00:02:10.350> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you're just gonna put it in the pan and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.370 
you're just gonna put it in the pan and
saute<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.160> until<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.390> dried<00:02:12.720> stuff

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
saute that until the the dried stuff

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
saute that until the the dried stuff
gets<00:02:13.970> constituted<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.120> water<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.540> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
gets constituted with water and it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.770 
gets constituted with water and it
becomes<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.200> alive<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.530> vibrant<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
becomes more alive and vibrant and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.600 
becomes more alive and vibrant and
easier<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.960> chew<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.130> mushrooms<00:02:20.280> are

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
easier to chew so the mushrooms are

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.610 
easier to chew so the mushrooms are
gonna<00:02:20.700> plump<00:02:21.360> back<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:22.020> they<00:02:22.200> are<00:02:22.260> living

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
gonna plump back up like they are living

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.240 
gonna plump back up like they are living
and<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.820> seaweed<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> become<00:02:25.890> very

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and the seaweed is going to become very

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.330 
and the seaweed is going to become very
soft<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.360> whenever<00:02:27.930> that's<00:02:28.230> finished<00:02:28.890> we're

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
soft and whenever that's finished we're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.430 
soft and whenever that's finished we're
going<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> combine<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.880> after<00:02:30.690> draining<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
going to combine that after draining the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.780 
going to combine that after draining the
water<00:02:31.740> out<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.720> rock<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.990> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.350> look<00:02:34.590> here

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
water out of a rock so if you look here

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.990 
water out of a rock so if you look here
you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.820> really<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.950> mushrooms<00:02:38.220> coming

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can really see the mushrooms coming

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300 
you can really see the mushrooms coming
back<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.540> life<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.620> add<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.010> mushrooms

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
back to life so we add in the mushrooms

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.180 
back to life so we add in the mushrooms
and<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.420> seaweed<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> broccoli<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.070> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190

miso sauce and I'm just gonna put a
little<00:02:47.070> bit<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.280> sea<00:02:47.430> salt<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:49.530> just

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
little bit of sea salt because it's just

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
little bit of sea salt because it's just
all<00:02:49.920> depending<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.520> your<00:02:50.730> preference<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
all depending on your preference but I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
all depending on your preference but I
like<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.530> little<00:02:52.560> bit<00:02:52.740> saltier

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
like to have it a little bit saltier

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.000 
like to have it a little bit saltier
also<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> little<00:02:54.330> blood<00:02:54.570> pressure<00:02:55.010> so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
also I have a little blood pressure so

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.650 
also I have a little blood pressure so
with<00:02:56.459> low<00:02:56.610> blood<00:02:56.790> pressure<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:57.270> say<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
with low blood pressure they say to have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.570 
with low blood pressure they say to have
more<00:02:57.900> salt<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> try<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.070> more<00:02:59.190> salt<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
more salt so I try to have more salt in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.220 
more salt so I try to have more salt in
my<00:02:59.670> diet<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.570> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.870> high<00:03:01.050> blood

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
my diet but if you have high blood

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
my diet but if you have high blood
pressure<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.650> open<00:03:02.100> extra<00:03:02.370> salt<00:03:02.610> okay<00:03:03.000> so

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
pressure and open extra salt okay so

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.930 
pressure and open extra salt okay so
that's<00:03:03.480> kind<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.650> side<00:03:04.860> note<00:03:05.190> but

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
that's kind of on the side note but

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.670 
that's kind of on the side note but
basically<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:07.350> bit<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> sea<00:03:07.650> salt

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
basically just a little bit of sea salt

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770 
basically just a little bit of sea salt
goes<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> long<00:03:08.340> way<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.330> really<00:03:09.510> good<00:03:09.660> for

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
goes a long way and it's really good for

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.030 
goes a long way and it's really good for
you<00:03:09.840> tons<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.350> minerals<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
you tons of minerals and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.330 
you tons of minerals and
so<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.180> really<00:03:12.299> something<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:14.069> replace

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
so it's really something that to replace

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.970 
so it's really something that to replace
just<00:03:14.760> regular<00:03:15.030> table<00:03:15.329> salt<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.739> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
just regular table salt and that's it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.890 
just regular table salt and that's it
and<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.430> stir<00:03:17.849> it<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.659> we're<00:03:18.780> going

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and you just stir it up and we're going

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.799 
and you just stir it up and we're going
to<00:03:18.989> serve<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.439> and<00:03:19.890> enjoy<00:03:20.670> our<00:03:21.799> nieces
