overall the design looks ray as you guys
could<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.450> we<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.930> glossy<00:00:37.739> finish<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
could see we have a glossy finish at the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.069 
could see we have a glossy finish at the
bottom<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.660> more<00:00:40.079> brushed<00:00:40.530> metal<00:00:41.040> look

and underneath that the thin bezels do
have<00:00:46.440> matte<00:00:46.770> finish<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.180> perfect<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
have matte finish so it is perfect for a

of the device itself the buttons are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.310 
of the device itself the buttons are
clicky<00:00:55.190> which<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:57.270> advantage<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
clicky which are an advantage and a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
clicky which are an advantage and a
disadvantage<00:00:58.609> they<00:00:59.609> always<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.600> work<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
disadvantage they always do work and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.000 
disadvantage they always do work and
they<00:01:01.489> did<00:01:02.489> give<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:02.760> decent<00:01:03.750> feedback<00:01:04.260> but

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
they did give some decent feedback but

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
they did give some decent feedback but
it<00:01:05.250> doesn't<00:01:05.670> look<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.119> nice<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.840> touch<00:01:07.229> screens

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it doesn't look as nice as touch screens

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.859 
it doesn't look as nice as touch screens
that<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> swipe<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.420> finger

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that you just need to swipe your finger

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
over such as Dell overall I did use this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.140 
over such as Dell overall I did use this
with<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.540> air<00:01:15.810> guitar<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.380> arms<00:01:17.150> especially

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
with my air guitar on arms especially

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.440 
with my air guitar on arms especially
since<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> monitor<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.920> quite<00:01:20.250> shaky<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.119> its

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
since the monitor was quite shaky on its

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
since the monitor was quite shaky on its
stand<00:01:21.750> itself<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> price<00:01:23.490> point

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stand itself but for the price point

stand itself but for the price point
that<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.420> monitor<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.460> isn't<00:01:26.670> a

that this monitor is this really isn't a

that this monitor is this really isn't a
big<00:01:27.360> disadvantage<00:01:28.729> overall<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.360> two

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
big disadvantage overall we have two

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.270 
big disadvantage overall we have two
HDMI<00:01:31.380> 's<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.939> VGA<00:01:33.570> port<00:01:33.990> which<00:01:34.650> isn't<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
HDMI 's and a VGA port which isn't a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
HDMI 's and a VGA port which isn't a
great<00:01:35.640> arsenal<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:37.880> monitor<00:01:38.880> connections

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
great arsenal of a monitor connections

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.389 
great arsenal of a monitor connections
but<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> does<00:01:40.829> live<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.000> expectations

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
but it does live up to the expectations

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
but it does live up to the expectations
we<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.119> DisplayPort<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.229> anything

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
we do not have DisplayPort or anything

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.940 
we do not have DisplayPort or anything
else<00:01:47.220> included<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> box<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.890> is

else included in the box but this is

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.899 
else included in the box but this is
again<00:01:51.280> for<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> price<00:01:52.060> point<00:01:52.590> acceptable

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
again for the price point acceptable

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.240 
again for the price point acceptable
overall<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.210> device<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.930> really<00:01:56.619> well

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
overall this device is really well

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.580 
overall this device is really well
suited<00:01:57.700> for<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.180> multi<00:01:58.539> model<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.990> set<00:01:59.229> up<00:01:59.380> and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
suited for a multi model to set up and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.249 
suited for a multi model to set up and
that's<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:00.039> reason<00:02:00.399> I'll<00:02:00.610> review<00:02:01.179> this<00:02:01.479> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
that's the reason I'll review this the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.039 
that's the reason I'll review this the
stand<00:02:02.560> itself<00:02:02.979> as<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.549> guys<00:02:03.759> will<00:02:04.299> be<00:02:04.539> able<00:02:04.750> to

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
stand itself as you guys will be able to

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.520 
stand itself as you guys will be able to
see<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.560> clip<00:02:05.979> here<00:02:06.569> you<00:02:07.569> see<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.019> it<00:02:08.200> is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
see in this clip here you see that it is

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.410 
see in this clip here you see that it is
shaky<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.209> purple<00:02:13.209> /<00:02:13.750> black<00:02:14.910> finish<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
shaky with a purple / black finish to it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.140 
shaky with a purple / black finish to it
so<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.110> definitely<00:02:17.500> do<00:02:17.980> recommend<00:02:18.400> using<00:02:18.880> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
so I definitely do recommend using a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.619 
so I definitely do recommend using a
Negatron<00:02:19.780> arm<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
Negatron arm or if you if you have a

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.670 
Negatron arm or if you if you have a
more<00:02:22.989> stable<00:02:23.349> death<00:02:23.920> than<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.370> am<00:02:24.580> because<00:02:25.680> I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
more stable death than I am because I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.110 
more stable death than I am because I
have<00:02:27.670> an<00:02:27.910> Ikea<00:02:28.569> desk<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.310> shaky

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
have an Ikea desk and it really is shaky

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.280 
have an Ikea desk and it really is shaky
all<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.510> time<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> image

since it's a matte finish and it really

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.750

doesn't<00:02:51.040> reflect<00:02:51.670> any<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.799> images<00:02:54.489> around
