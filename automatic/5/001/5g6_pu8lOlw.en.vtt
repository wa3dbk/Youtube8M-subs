00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.960
 and then today I am going to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.630
 present a video for modÃ© sleeping 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 dogs on xbox 360 so as usual 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.910
 you need horizons and the book 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.640
 software for model cycling dogs you 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.129
 put the usb stick in your xbox 360 and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.420
 it's up to you level 3 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.170
 centers you put it on your pc with 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.539
 the backup 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.010
 so I do not explain each time 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.410
 how to do it because I have 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 already made videos like minecraft 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.760
 had said off where all the beginning explained 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.429
 so you make the beginning of the video and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.670
 to see how to do it for 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.829
 learn the basis of modding and after 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 you do the following for sleeping pattern 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.049
 dogs so there you go in games on 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.420
 aurizon you normally you have a 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.930
 sleeping dogs or click on the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 little arrow you take the backup 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.799
 no automatic game save 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.880
 you take the right backup of which 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.280
 you can see that up to him for 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.360
 hundred so when I'm going to show you a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.710
 little map etc 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.690
 there will be no spoil what are there 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 for sure I put them on the desk 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.030
 so there you take your thing makes you 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.960
 the other file or get your stuff 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.649
 - it's called hk game is 1 2 3 4 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 good it's the same thing what's there 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.420
 you click on max hk so if you 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.789
 want to have the maximum jica but I 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.740
 still removed a small 9 in case 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.030
 where if we are in negative it would not be 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.240
 not practical 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.090
 so we'll put on we'll keep 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.780
 maximum holds and the xp we will put to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.119
 remove it 1.9 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.920
 so here you can have all 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.860
 unlocked you do not have to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.830
 cochet but for the video I'm going I 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 I'm going to put everything for you 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.200
 see that it works nickel 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.260
 so it's just a little boring of everything 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.280
 click damage that is not a button of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.670
 automatic selection 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.220
 but it must take five minutes 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.810
 big max we see there so it's soon 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.280
 finished 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.080
 so you may have noticed that there is 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 already check sheets because I have 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.310
 already unlocked so spy camera so that I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.569
 believe it's the different cities 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.129
 and who you find cameras for 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.980
 for hackers and I'm not sure to 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.209
 100% but I think that's it and by 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.970
 example if you checked them all 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.280
 it means that you have all found and 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.670
 defused will not defused but 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.099
 hacked what's there then it's boks a 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.750
 found on the map 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.890
 so we'll all checked 1 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:13.420
 yeah good until home on this thomas 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.190
 on this city and after I should in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.409
 out of the video because otherwise it's going 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.670
 take a little too much time and that's 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.110
 it's not really important what 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.799
 here are all checked 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.269
 this I must check 15 45 45 60 times that 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.950
 going to be long there you can too 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.910
 change your stats 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.910
 so we're going to hire some of them at 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.019
 job 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:54.310
 this is page 2 what is the cats 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:56.859
 reis at the flat stats games where we put the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.739
 maximum you and that's so you put 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.450
 pretty much what you want so there 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:08.470
 statistics we will put them to the max 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:11.260
 by lowering them a little bit so 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.669
 there my stats and the saga is really 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.940
 mode is full but you're not 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:20.799
 obliged what and that's so I do not know 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.860
 if at risks daubanes because I 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.200
 have not done yet and this is my little 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.210
 girl games that is well shit and that's it 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.479
 so you click on save challenge 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.020
 between h between zain here you have it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.680
 moved party be you move it either 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.680
 you right click 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.540
 longval we will delete it 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.710
 letters 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:53.940
 yes you do injected and you take 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.090
 your sink holiday word skippy step 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.830
 and that's the 16th mode and so I'll tell you 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.470
 advise to make a duplicate of your 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.790
 backup in case if you want 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.560
 have for example a backup mode and 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.570
 a normal backup if you who 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.170
 so choose here we end up on the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.790
 xbox immediately 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.040
 so here I have to throw the game 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.170
 sleeping dogs so for those who do not 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.910
 do not know this game it's kind of 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.300
 so gta like in china to hong 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.000
 kong 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.570
 so there you can do pretty much what 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.280
 who has in gta where the graphics are 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 really well done could steal 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.580
 Car 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.370
 here are some side missions and 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.830
 main business so this game it is 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.430
 really well right and in addition there is 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.290
 a lot of fighting techniques 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.390
 so if you want there is a demo on 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.210
 the xbox live follow the test and that's it 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.430
 so as soon as the backup and mode and 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.980
 you press start to see that it 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.210
 works well what you can see the 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.370
 under for max but still a lot to 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.560
 you can do just about anything 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.390
 you want to buy cars at 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.640
 eat etc etc 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.590
 so here we will go into improvement 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.530
 where you can see perched at 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:19.090
 10 maximum and 254 points to spend 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.530
 we forgot to think the confirmed 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.840
 it's a bit long I will not do it 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:29.310
 everything here you can change no a 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.340
 added posts spend your points 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:38.620
 to have superior abilities 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.560
 so to the triads to fonts in 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.270
 melee training in reputation but 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.419
 I believe they are already put you have 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:51.790
 the max reputation so all unlocked and 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.160
 all all the objects hotel to find 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.360
 to double the hotels I have not that if it is 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.930
 said like that but it's the little stuff 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.990
 red who's right in front of me at 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.760
 find in the amap is there with the 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.650
 modding is good the adjet all can 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.800
 so you too can see in 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.800
 the statistics that all your words dy 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.970

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:23.500
 objects no I found them a 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:25.930
 good part here is 64 64 you saw 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.580

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.080
 not all checked 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.770
 so that's normal I do not have everything all 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:35.550
 unlocked but most what so 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:40.000
