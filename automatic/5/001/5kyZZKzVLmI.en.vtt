and<00:00:09.290> today<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.590> staring<00:00:11.010> at<00:00:11.280> two<00:00:11.639> bottles

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and today we're staring at two bottles

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.140 
and today we're staring at two bottles
of<00:00:12.420> ammonia<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.639> for<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.700> intensive

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
of ammonia and for all intensive

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.240 
of ammonia and for all intensive
purposes<00:00:15.210> these<00:00:15.780> two<00:00:16.199> bottles<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.710> ammonia

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
purposes these two bottles of ammonia

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.660 
purposes these two bottles of ammonia
look<00:00:17.460> exactly<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> same<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:20.279> reason<00:00:20.580> why

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
look exactly the same and the reason why

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.010 
look exactly the same and the reason why
we're<00:00:20.880> looking<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.180> two<00:00:21.300> bottles<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> ammonia

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we're looking at two bottles of ammonia

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.800 
we're looking at two bottles of ammonia
is<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:23.460> couple<00:00:24.000> people<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.510> sent<00:00:24.720> me

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
is because a couple people have sent me

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.920 
is because a couple people have sent me
emails<00:00:24.869> asking<00:00:25.529> me<00:00:25.830> about<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.310> fishless

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
emails asking me about the fishless

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.740 
emails asking me about the fishless
cycle<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.490> ammonia<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.240> cycle<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
cycle and how I use ammonia to cycle the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.580 
cycle and how I use ammonia to cycle the
the<00:00:31.170> filters<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> new<00:00:32.160> tank<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.469> have<00:00:34.469> been

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the filters in a new tank and have been

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
the filters in a new tank and have been
questions<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> choose<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

questions about how to choose the right
ammonia

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ammonia

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
ammonia
well<00:00:38.250> basically<00:00:38.430> first<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:39.149> obviously<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
well basically first thing obviously you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.880 
well basically first thing obviously you
want<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:41.210> ammonia<00:00:42.260> look<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
want to get ammonia look at look at the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
want to get ammonia look at look at the
label<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> back<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.000> sure<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> says

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
label at the back and make sure it says

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.979 
label at the back and make sure it says
ammonia<00:00:46.289> there's<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.750> places<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.960> there

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
ammonia there's some places out there

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.490 
ammonia there's some places out there
that<00:00:49.379> sell<00:00:49.820> scented<00:00:50.820> ammonia<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.379> know

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that sell scented ammonia you know

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
that sell scented ammonia you know
things<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.920> citrus<00:00:53.670> scented<00:00:54.539> stuff<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
things like citrus scented stuff and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959 
things like citrus scented stuff and
stay<00:00:55.530> away<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.730> want

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
stay away from all that all you want

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930 
stay away from all that all you want
100%<00:00:57.570> ammonia<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.280> though<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> label

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
100% ammonia but even though the label

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
100% ammonia but even though the label
sometimes<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:01.020> says<00:01:01.230> ammonia<00:01:03.500> there's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
sometimes just says ammonia there's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.179 
sometimes just says ammonia there's
sometimes<00:01:05.810> well<00:01:06.810> you'll<00:01:07.260> run<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.680> cases

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sometimes well you'll run into cases

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
sometimes well you'll run into cases
where<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.549> add<00:01:08.990> surfactants<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
where they add surfactants into the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
where they add surfactants into the
ammonia<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.040> sometimes<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.729> listed

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
ammonia and sometimes it's not listed

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
ammonia and sometimes it's not listed
here<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:17.100> could<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.430> bad<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
here and it that could be bad it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
here and it that could be bad it's
basically<00:01:18.210> soap<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> makes<00:01:19.049> makes<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
basically soap that makes makes the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.469 
basically soap that makes makes the
ammonia<00:01:20.310> bubble<00:01:21.439> for<00:01:22.439> better<00:01:22.979> cleaning

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
ammonia bubble for better cleaning

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
ammonia bubble for better cleaning
efficiency<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> guess<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> bubbles<00:01:26.009> are

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
efficiency I guess but the bubbles are

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.990 
efficiency I guess but the bubbles are
good<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.340> cleaning<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.670> they're<00:01:26.880> really

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
good for cleaning but they're really

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.340 
good for cleaning but they're really
really<00:01:27.180> bad<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.689> aquarium<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.110> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
really bad for your aquarium and really

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
really bad for your aquarium and really
really<00:01:28.500> bad<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.040> fish<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
really bad for your fish so you want to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.580 
really bad for your fish so you want to
make<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> type<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
make sure you want to get the type of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
make sure you want to get the type of
ammonia<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.579> does<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.650> surfactants

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
ammonia that does not have surfactants

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
ammonia that does not have surfactants
in<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.119> easy<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> tell

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in it and the one very easy way to tell

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.219 
in it and the one very easy way to tell
is<00:01:37.530> basically<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.939> shake<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> bottle<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.020> see

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
is basically to shake the bottle and see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.140 
is basically to shake the bottle and see
which<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.619> foams<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.970> two

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
which one foams up and here I have two

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.530 
which one foams up and here I have two
bottles<00:01:42.509> exactly<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.990> same<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
bottles exactly the same I think one is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
bottles exactly the same I think one is
a<00:01:45.570> generic<00:01:45.960> form<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.649> bottles<00:01:47.250> look

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
a generic form of the other bottles look

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.940 
a generic form of the other bottles look
exactly<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.909> same<00:01:48.439> except<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> labels

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
exactly the same except for the labels

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
exactly the same except for the labels
and<00:01:50.100> stuff<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and stuff and you can see there's a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
and stuff and you can see there's a
little<00:01:52.290> space<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.740> top<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.420> there's<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
little space on top here there's the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
little space on top here there's the
ammonia<00:01:55.079> level<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> air<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
ammonia level and this bit of air and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
ammonia level and this bit of air and
there's<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> ammonia<00:01:57.930> level<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.380> there's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
there's the ammonia level and there's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
there's the ammonia level and there's
right<00:01:59.280> away<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.580> can<00:01:59.730> see<00:01:59.910> already<00:02:00.060> there's

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
right away you can see already there's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.750 
right away you can see already there's
some<00:02:00.630> bubbles<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.080> this<00:02:01.260> one<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> no<00:02:02.370> bubbles

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
some bubbles in this one and no bubbles

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.300 
some bubbles in this one and no bubbles

at that no bubbles no bubbles anywhere
to<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.310> found<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.660> bubble<00:02:19.020> here<00:02:19.200> but

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
to be found one one bubble here but

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.940 
to be found one one bubble here but
technically<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.310> disappear<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:22.680> one

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
I'm going to shake it look what happens

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.030 
I'm going to shake it look what happens
all<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:32.100> foam<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.290> surfactants

and<00:03:18.600> look<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.590> bubbles<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.130> there<00:03:20.280> are

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and look for bubbles if there are

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.430 
and look for bubbles if there are
bubbles<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.630> has<00:03:21.870> some<00:03:22.049> factions

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
bubbles like this it has some factions

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.009 
bubbles like this it has some factions
in<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.340> want<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.630> does<00:03:24.870> not

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
in it you don't want this if it does not

and clear and that's the ammonia you
want<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.090> bought<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.630> one<00:03:30.840> in

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
want you can I bought this one in

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.280 
want you can I bought this one in
particular<00:03:31.290> from<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.890> local<00:03:32.250> hardware<00:03:32.549> store

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
particular from a local hardware store

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.009 
particular from a local hardware store
this<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.590> obviously<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.519> Walmart<00:03:35.880> brand

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
this is obviously the Walmart brand

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.110 
this is obviously the Walmart brand
great<00:03:37.019> value<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.459> see<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.880> does

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
great value and as you can see it does

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.380 
great value and as you can see it does
have<00:03:39.480> surfactants<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:41.120> try<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.299> local

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
have surfactants so try your local

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.240 
have surfactants so try your local
hardware<00:03:42.810> store<00:03:43.079> they<00:03:43.230> might<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.650> just

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
hardware store they might have just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.280 
hardware store they might have just
hundred<00:03:44.549> percent<00:03:45.000> ammonia<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.600> that's<00:03:46.140> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
hundred percent ammonia and that's the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.539 
hundred percent ammonia and that's the
one<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.500> want<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.709> choose<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:47.130> your<00:03:47.220> fishless

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
one you want to choose for your fishless

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.539 
one you want to choose for your fishless
cycle<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.620> how<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.799> choose<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.070> million

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
cycle so that's how you choose a million

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.509 
cycle so that's how you choose a million
for<00:03:50.670> your<00:03:50.760> future<00:03:51.030> cycle<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:52.829> guess<00:03:53.220> we'll

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
for your future cycle and I guess we'll

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.920 
for your future cycle and I guess we'll
see<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.329> next<00:03:54.570> time<00:03:54.920> later
