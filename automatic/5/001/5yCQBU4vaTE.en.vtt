00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.400 
style lick in the key of E and this lick
is<00:00:44.640> similar<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> something<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.260> would

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is similar to something that he would

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.940 
is similar to something that he would
play<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:47.059> Electric<00:00:48.059> Ladyland<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> song<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
play off Electric Ladyland the song I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.060 
play off Electric Ladyland the song I
believe<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.940> called<00:00:51.180> voodoo<00:00:51.570> child<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.320> think

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
believe was called voodoo child I think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.700 
believe was called voodoo child I think
is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> pronunciation<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.590> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is the pronunciation of it not to be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
is the pronunciation of it not to be
confused<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.670> child<00:00:57.090> which<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
confused with little child which is a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
confused with little child which is a
totally<00:00:58.440> different<00:00:58.469> sounding<00:00:59.129> song<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
totally different sounding song this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.950 
totally different sounding song this is
one<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.780> favorites<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> lick<00:01:03.600> sounds

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one of my favorites so the lick sounds

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:23.530 
one of my favorites so the lick sounds
like<00:01:04.079> this<00:01:04.289> key<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> E

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.570 

so<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.690> just<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.930> real<00:01:25.140> moody<00:01:25.710> type<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.310> blues

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so it's just a real moody type of blues

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.780 
so it's just a real moody type of blues
lick<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.360> our<00:01:27.860> really<00:01:28.860> characteristic<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lick and our really characteristic of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840 
lick and our really characteristic of
the<00:01:29.910> jimi<00:01:30.150> hendrix<00:01:30.600> sound<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.730> once<00:01:32.730> again

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the jimi hendrix sound and once again

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.600 
the jimi hendrix sound and once again
this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> key<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.690> e<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:35.010> what<00:01:35.400> we're<00:01:35.520> going

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this is the key of e so what we're going

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
this is the key of e so what we're going
to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.300> hit<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.510> open<00:01:37.050> string

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
to do is just hit the open string

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.150 
to do is just hit the open string
starting<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.440> sounds<00:01:40.740> cool<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
starting out and it sounds cool when you

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.650 
starting out and it sounds cool when you
play<00:01:41.340> by<00:01:41.550> yourself<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.330> doing<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
play by yourself if you're doing like a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.500
