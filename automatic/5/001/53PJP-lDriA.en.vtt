00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
going to need is to take two pieces of

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.119 
going to need is to take two pieces of
black<00:00:12.429> construction<00:00:12.700> paper<00:00:13.919> put<00:00:14.919> them

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
black construction paper put them

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.920 
black construction paper put them
together<00:00:15.309> and<00:00:15.789> fold<00:00:16.600> them<00:00:16.720> in<00:00:16.900> half

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
together and fold them in half

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.790 
together and fold them in half
horizontally<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.960> we're<00:00:23.230> going<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.620> take<00:00:23.770> a

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
horizontally then we're going to take a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.200 
horizontally then we're going to take a
white<00:00:24.070> pencil<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.670> we're<00:00:24.790> going<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:24.970> draw<00:00:25.180> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
white pencil and we're going to draw a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.240 
white pencil and we're going to draw a
half<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.810> butterfly<00:00:26.290> so<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.710> when<00:00:26.860> we<00:00:27.010> open

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
half of a butterfly so that when we open

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.770 
half of a butterfly so that when we open
it<00:00:27.700> up<00:00:27.820> at<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.090> end<00:00:28.270> it'll<00:00:28.570> be<00:00:28.780> symmetrical

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
it up at the end it'll be symmetrical

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:39.299 
it up at the end it'll be symmetrical
and<00:00:31.780> I'm<00:00:31.900> just<00:00:32.050> going<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.230> freehand<00:00:32.770> this<00:00:38.309> once

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
and I'm just going to freehand this once

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
you're going to cut it out keeping it

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.079 
you're going to cut it out keeping it
folded<00:00:52.629> we're<00:00:52.809> now<00:00:52.929> going<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.440> draw<00:00:53.999> we're<00:00:54.999> now

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
folded we're now going to draw we're now

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.439 
folded we're now going to draw we're now
going<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.600> draw<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:57.039> designs<00:00:57.399> for<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.670> on<00:00:58.120> the

going to draw the designs for the on the

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.849 
going to draw the designs for the on the
wings<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:01.569> you'll<00:01:01.809> want<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.050> make<00:01:02.229> these<00:01:02.499> big

wings and you'll want to make these big
enough<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.339> can<00:01:03.670> cut<00:01:03.999> out<00:01:04.030> if<00:01:04.600> they're

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
enough that you can cut out if they're

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.240 
enough that you can cut out if they're
too<00:01:05.110> small<00:01:05.379> you're<00:01:05.590> going<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.770> have<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> harder

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
too small you're going to have a harder

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:16.789 
too small you're going to have a harder
time

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
some tissue paper and fill in the parts

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
some tissue paper and fill in the parts
that<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.340> cut<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:37.640> I've<00:01:38.640> picked<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.209> purple

and yellow tissue paper what you want to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.830 
and yellow tissue paper what you want to
do<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.319> cut<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.539> they

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
do is just cut these so that they

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.249 
do is just cut these so that they
overlap<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.729> holes<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> cut<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
overlap the holes that you cut and it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:59.179 
overlap the holes that you cut and it
doesn't<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.739> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.039> perfect<00:01:58.039> we're<00:01:59.039> going

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
doesn't have to be perfect we're going

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.270 
doesn't have to be perfect we're going
to<00:01:59.250> put<00:01:59.640> some<00:01:59.880> glue<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.789> edges<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:04.280> then

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
to put some glue on the edges and then

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.059 
to put some glue on the edges and then
we're<00:02:05.459> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.849> glue<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.770> our<00:02:07.770> tissue

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
we're going to glue down our tissue

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.819 
we're going to glue down our tissue
paper<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.140> any<00:02:10.380> remaining

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
paper and if there's any remaining

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.530 
paper and if there's any remaining
hanging<00:02:11.310> over<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.549> edge<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.329> trim

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
hanging over the edge you can just trim

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.920 
hanging over the edge you can just trim
that<00:02:12.599> up<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.389> the<00:02:21.540> same<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
that up and then we do the same with a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.400 
that up and then we do the same with a
purple<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.560> top<00:02:23.060> we've<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.299> glued<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
purple on the top we've now glued the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.430 
purple on the top we've now glued the
tissue<00:02:25.650> paper<00:02:25.769> at<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> top

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
tissue paper at the bottom and the top

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
tissue paper at the bottom and the top
to<00:02:28.440> give<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.769> more<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.220> clean<00:02:29.609> finished

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
to give this more of a clean finished
