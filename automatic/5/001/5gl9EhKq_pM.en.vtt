 edge forever green tomato yes we rarely 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.939
 manages to grow thomas which 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.910
 blushes in the greenhouse hothouse 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.490
 tomatoes are very ultra early 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.769
 virtually none or not the pool is very 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.980
 early either these varieties that give 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 small crop we will talk about in n 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.780
 determinant varieties and these varieties give 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.600
 these are wonderful grams of 300 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 tomatoes that are thick like me 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.289
 until they mature this year they 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 got it all located spraying 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.050
 cold and pins in heat zircon 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.250
 necessarily and the hit always sits 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.690
 lanthanum top dressing she has so much mineral water 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.649
 there was no fun hum 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 never be under the tomatoes peppers 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.620
 today when they are healthy all the plants

 the names will surely be described 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.730
 if you really want to tear a tomato 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 take it and do it like that for evil 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.350
 it is easy to separate a tomato but the hole will be 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 no bacteria viruses go in here 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.820

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.410
 called favorite 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.410
 this skull from cherry is not easy 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.280
 this is the cherry that is due to genetic 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.490
 features 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.800

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.420
 you will not find this sweet 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.860
 no other sort she 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.170
 for two reasons 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.090
 first moment is a hybrid hybrid 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.550
 modern which possesses and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.400
 complex disease resistance is not enough 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
 the fact that he is still sick, so he is also 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 comfortable in seedlings 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.070
 it is so compact and interesting 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.410
 plant in seedlings which is not 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.510
 drawn out and very easy to grow 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.470
 just this hybrid look what 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.410
 brush it is double on this one feature 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.510
 says that you're a fork 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.000
 here is a double brush is this feature 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.280
 says volume is genetic just 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.430
 sweets i'm holding small hands 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.920
 Tomatoes are just favorites. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.370
 a hybrid she with a slight sourness 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.280
 and the skin is just sugary and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 it is this combination that makes it a hybrid 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.090
 so unique and so 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.980
 claimed for us in our conditions 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.600
 in Siberia, it grows well 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.820
 cherry tomatoes they ripen 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.549
 much faster than ordinary tomatoes 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.900
 for example in order to mature 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.170
 standard tomato for example 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.530
 it takes about 50 days and for 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.000
 order to ripen cherry and need 35-40 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.310
 days skull 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.650
 much earlier than any other tomatoes and 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.830
 pay attention that tomatoes 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.480
 that eggplants that they don't like peppers 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.380
 when they are planted very early on 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.670
 seedlings so any hybrids varieties we 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.500
 sow on seedlings no earlier than first 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470
 March numbers, seedling growing period 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.260
 tomato about 50 55 days 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.670
 respectively, we remove the period of descents 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.410
 about 5 days and it turns out 60 days from 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.519
 sowing before landing on a permanent place 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.489
 residence responsibly if we 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.769
 we land in the greenhouse approximately 20 May 25 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.819
 they must sow tomato and seedlings 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.159
 approximately 20 March 25, but not before 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.109
 if you are late with tomato sowing 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.780
 nothing terrible and not catch up and 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.389
 surpass everything you need to create it 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.250
 conditions for growth ie full 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.310
 nutrition is timely and this fertilizer 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.430
 red giant we all know abundant 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.889
 highlighting the germination period when they 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.979
 lights up continuously at 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.990
 in about 14 days in order to 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.870
 lay down generative kidneys for 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.300
 so that seedlings develop better and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.250
 Be sure to withstand the temperature during the day 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.539
 when we light up the temperature 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.030
 about 22 and 25 degrees in the evening lower 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.699
 to 16 and 18 degrees it is this one 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.699
 the regime finally gives these fruits 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.759
