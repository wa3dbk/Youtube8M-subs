some vinegar in it most people don't
realize<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:58.039> believe<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.489> taste<00:00:59.699> like

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
a really sweet puff tart that is kind of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.399 
a really sweet puff tart that is kind of
red<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> white<00:01:03.750> frosting<00:01:04.320> inside<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
red with a white frosting inside of it I

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.420 
red with a white frosting inside of it I
think<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.680> gave<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> somebody<00:01:08.189> with

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
think if I gave it to somebody with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.410 
think if I gave it to somebody with
their<00:01:08.549> eyes<00:01:08.670> closed<00:01:08.909> didn't<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
their eyes closed didn't know what it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
their eyes closed didn't know what it
was<00:01:09.770> they<00:01:10.770> were<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> say<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> tastes<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.490> a
