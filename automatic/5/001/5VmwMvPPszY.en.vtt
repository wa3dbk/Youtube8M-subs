00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.390
 guide on the mascots and we're going 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.269
 see how to beat the nishi farmer 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.740
 version 2 so always with only one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.410
 poet but this time it will be the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.830
 emperor crab so the emperor crab to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.210
 use in version pp so with 357 of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 power that made one of the countries the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.539
 more powerful of the game and with low one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 will be able to flap two more 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.140
 little beasts so here you start 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.590
 with the swirling there he will put 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.880
 sunny weather 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.719
 you take this opportunity to put the wave of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.989
 care and then we can go but 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.989
 the influx 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.930
 and therefore always the influx 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.890
 and a last influx 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.439
 and that's first ep gives you go to 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 second so there he will run away so 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.810
 before he runs away you put a 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.759
 little influx bing so he stays 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.409
 several sunny weather towers 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.090
 we take the opportunity to put a big he 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.479
 as sakho the weather will drop bond will be 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 full live so there he has one left 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.130
 turning shot put the swirling 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.780
 we're going to get the other two peta 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.780
 power the wheat so a little job here 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:08.750
 even a little bat is there 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.130
 now we can go back again 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.560
 our skin cravans that like you 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.670
 see almost crowd life so there we are 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.850
 take advantage we put a swirl this 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:26.690
 sense he can not play for now 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:29.990
 bing is here we'll let go this turn 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.570
 Here they want to put us greece 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:39.430
 in addition but and the swirling that 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.720
 proc is in second place gives 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.330
 now we come to the third 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670
 so here first it puts you drooling 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:54.680
 acid so you enjoy it yourself 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:56.570
 put a cost of more there after he goes 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:04.220
 do not care and so we enjoy it but 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:06.500
 the influx as we play before that so 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.870
 there after we begin a look for it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.340
 can just hold the year fond of good 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.370
 there is a little luck but it 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:24.170
 do not change anything at home 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:26.130
 is a swirl and then we go 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:34.190
 kill like the others 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.190
 so many rounds it's set or maybe 3 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.750
 it will be 3 and then we finish it and that's it 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.360
 you can have the wishes both 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.430
 mascots without any difficulty with this 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.790
 little toad taker see you soon for a 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.790
