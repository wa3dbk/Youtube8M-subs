on amazon it's this hip mounted
magnifier<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.420> really<00:00:15.719> useful<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
magnifier and it's really useful it's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
magnifier and it's really useful it's
adjustable<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.430> turn<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.970> knob<00:00:18.210> here

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
adjustable you can turn this knob here

can see here that it's got two sets of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
can see here that it's got two sets of
lenses<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> fold<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.640> down<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
lenses and you can fold one down if you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
lenses and you can fold one down if you
just<00:00:36.570> need<00:00:36.719> slight<00:00:37.110> magnification<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
just need slight magnification if you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
just need slight magnification if you
need<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.760> snap<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> into<00:00:40.020> place<00:00:40.290> if

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
need more you snap this into place if

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
need more you snap this into place if
you<00:00:41.070> need<00:00:41.250> even<00:00:41.280> more<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you need even more you have this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
you need even more you have this
magnifying<00:00:43.829> lens<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.090> put<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
magnifying lens that you can put in

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.760 
magnifying lens that you can put in
front<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.950> also<00:00:47.390> illuminated<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.770> nice

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
front it's also illuminated the nice

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
front it's also illuminated the nice
bright<00:00:50.070> light<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> adjusts<00:00:51.559> down<00:00:53.000> or<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.510> or

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
bright light that adjusts down or up or

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
bright light that adjusts down or up or
even<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.340> side<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
even side to side so when I got this I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
even side to side so when I got this I
thought<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.359> electronics

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
thought it would be good for electronics

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.709 
thought it would be good for electronics
work<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.309> soldering<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
work to do soldering and it really is a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
work to do soldering and it really is a
great<00:01:03.960> tool<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.320> soldering<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> printed

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
great tool for soldering on printed

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060 
great tool for soldering on printed
circuit<00:01:06.060> boards<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.500> powerful

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
circuit boards it's a lot more powerful

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.300 
circuit boards it's a lot more powerful
than<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.810> reading<00:01:10.110> glasses<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
than not than reading glasses for me and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
than not than reading glasses for me and
I<00:01:11.970> also<00:01:13.700> find<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.939> convenient<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I also find really convenient to just be

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
I also find really convenient to just be
able<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> flip<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> rather<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:16.979> taking<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
able to flip it up rather than taking my

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
able to flip it up rather than taking my
glasses<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.600> off<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.320> I've<00:01:19.439> ended<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
glasses on and off but I've ended up

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
glasses on and off but I've ended up
using<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.430> many<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:21.000> things<00:01:21.330> than<00:01:21.509> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
using it for many more things than just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
using it for many more things than just
soldering<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.479> have<00:01:24.479> used<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
soldering one thing that I have used it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
soldering one thing that I have used it
for<00:01:24.930> point<00:01:25.200> splinters<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.340> kids<00:01:26.700> feet

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
for point splinters out of my kids feet

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
for point splinters out of my kids feet
and<00:01:27.420> fingers<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:29.009> used<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> check<00:01:29.520> lice

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
scalp it was really great for that I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780 
scalp it was really great for that I
used<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> quick<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.110> cats<00:01:43.409> toenails<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.399> used

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
used it to quick my cats toenails I used

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
used it to quick my cats toenails I used
it<00:01:44.970> last<00:01:45.149> night<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.689> pull<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.049> gunk<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> a

that I was playing around but I actually
end<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.500> using<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.979> thing<00:01:53.220> almost<00:01:53.549> every<00:01:54.119> day

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
end up using this thing almost every day
