00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 remember 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.050
 to be able to handle it on the scoreboard 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.330
 Honey is different than the two teams 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 come in good time and now more 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.450
 respect I remind you creator of step 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.000
 the past the past you learn things 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.010
 of the experience and it 's because of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 the present is what commands we will try 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.129
 a good match to win 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.379
 the rice has this experience in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 liguillas that you put this blue cross and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.280
 you have not seen him in previous years for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.020
 be able to change 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 good the conviction not 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 go through bad times at the beginning and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.450
 then they go through good times here in 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 the team found a balance then 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.640
 that considers it very important for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.980
 also take the step to leave it behind 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 back moment letter of 7 if you want that 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.450
 make some scars from that past 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.480
 with morelia so the vote happened 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.000
 extra field how do you take this kind of 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.180
 music that thought different way new 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 idol of always civil magazine when 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.880
 spend negative experiences in that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 moment he tried to take out the positive for 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 get something out of that and then the center in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.120
 what is presented to have a good 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.250
 future then 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.360
 today will return a very balanced match 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.180
 the two teams arrive in a moment 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.800
 we hope in a world as it turned out to be 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.880
 something was denied that experiences to 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.130
 line posters the result of knowing 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.820
 handle party times well 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 something of the scoreboard and be quiet in 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:58.150
 every moment that the red court plays 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.660
 first to play football I am what I 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.560
 no but this is a marker that this year 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.300
 that advantage 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.960
 it could be 23 after what 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.140
 again jealousy gonzÃ¡lez if 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.140
 felt more possible to score more goals 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.450
 even be smart and know then 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 score goals in three league games 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.270
 they are closed they play someone 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.850
 density since they are going to play 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.440
 smart entry 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.760
 I'm going to give it in this group that was not 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.190
 work of chance stops the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.970
 obtaining the compassion title that is 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.970
 a disturbing reality 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.770
 on the other hand on the court and out 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.280
 also on the court that already with follow 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 going forward 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 if you're interested in people not thinking 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.020
 that was the work of nine then we won a 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.510
 title today is very important for all 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.660
 us for the people but good and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.170
 happened now how important is the space to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.860
 morning 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.300
 morelia and know how to handle the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.300
 game times to take us the 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.830
 triumph of taking us a victory and of 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.830
 keep moving forward to wait 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.650
 freedom the friend can be yourself 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.020
 you just have to go out and do what 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.630
 what have you doing not to conform 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.230
 trust and search in all minutes 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.970
 of the game when closing the next toy 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.970
 very intense to be smart to know 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.170
 we have seen with their portals their 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.410
 skills and know how to contain their 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.410
 strengths 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.120
 considering what would be very 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.340
 important for all of us 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:10.870
 again then we have that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:14.060
 explanation to always look more 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.130
 today one of the most equipment was requested 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.550
 great of history 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.260
 as scalability 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.840
 what opinion do you deserve as a man of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.450
 football and of course you can have it 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.190
 so good that a great one is gone I never had 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.250
 opportunities to work with 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.490
 we can put javier did not have ministers 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.590
 of power is treatable gives 4 that is he 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.560
 not what he taught them, he delivered football 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.480
 a great professional and that led to what 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.950
 maximum to the team that he leads during 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.200
 years he was at the front is all a 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.980
 example to follow and hopefully as a model 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.980
 there are many more
