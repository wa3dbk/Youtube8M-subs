questions<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.640> bit<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.660> not

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
questions I was a little bit and not

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to keep going a little bit because I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100

a<00:05:30.370> little<00:05:30.790> bit<00:05:31.030> more<00:05:31.240> specific<00:05:31.510> than<00:05:32.200> I

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
a little bit more specific than I

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.080 
a little bit more specific than I
thought<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.860> lot<00:05:32.890> of<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.430> questions<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:34.060> had

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
thought and a lot of the questions I had

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.780 
thought and a lot of the questions I had
never<00:05:34.830> we<00:05:35.830> had<00:05:35.950> never<00:05:36.100> talked<00:05:36.430> about<00:05:36.550> some<00:05:36.760> of

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
never we had never talked about some of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.250 
never we had never talked about some of
the<00:05:36.910> stuff<00:05:36.970> that<00:05:37.180> were<00:05:37.540> in<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.660> were<00:05:38.080> in<00:05:38.169> the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
the stuff that were in that were in the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.870 
the stuff that were in that were in the
questions<00:05:38.620> in<00:05:38.830> my<00:05:39.010> schooling<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.729> was

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
questions in my schooling so I was

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.100 
questions in my schooling so I was
getting<00:05:40.150> kind<00:05:40.360> of<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.510> lot<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.720> those<00:05:40.870> wrong

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
getting kind of a lot of those wrong

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.200 
getting kind of a lot of those wrong
which<00:05:41.320> made<00:05:41.530> me<00:05:41.650> really<00:05:41.919> nervous<00:05:42.100> um<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:43.030> it

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
which made me really nervous um and it

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.570 
which made me really nervous um and it
also<00:05:43.360> comes<00:05:43.720> with<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:43.870> really<00:05:44.200> cool<00:05:44.410> CD<00:05:44.860> but

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
also comes with a really cool CD but

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.310 
also comes with a really cool CD but
unfortunately<00:05:45.700> i<00:05:46.240> didn't<00:05:46.720> realize<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.200> the

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
unfortunately i didn't realize that the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.110 
unfortunately i didn't realize that the
CD<00:05:47.530> only<00:05:47.860> worked<00:05:48.070> for<00:05:48.490> windows-based

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
CD only worked for windows-based

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.930 
CD only worked for windows-based
computers<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.140> i<00:05:50.470> only<00:05:50.740> have<00:05:50.890> mac<00:05:51.520> computers

in<00:05:52.150> my<00:05:52.240> house<00:05:52.390> so<00:05:52.660> i<00:05:53.020> had<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.440> take<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:53.680> book

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
in my house so i had to take that book

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.110 
in my house so i had to take that book
back<00:05:54.039> because<00:05:54.370> that<00:05:54.520> was<00:05:54.700> one<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:54.970> main

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
back because that was one of the main

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.210 
back because that was one of the main
reasons<00:05:55.450> i<00:05:55.539> bought<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.289> i<00:05:56.710> couldn't<00:05:57.130> use

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
reasons i bought it and i couldn't use

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.770 
reasons i bought it and i couldn't use
it<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:57.550> it's<00:05:57.700> cool<00:05:57.910> because<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:58.300> does<00:05:58.600> the

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
it but it's cool because it does the

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.719 
it but it's cool because it does the
kind<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.020> same<00:05:59.169> thing<00:05:59.350> of<00:05:59.470> in<00:05:59.650> plex<00:05:59.919> where<00:06:00.190> you

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
kind of same thing of in plex where you

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.520 
kind of same thing of in plex where you
take<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.240> question<00:06:01.720> you<00:06:01.780> take<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.050> test<00:06:02.289> and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
take the question you take the test and

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.279 
take the question you take the test and
it<00:06:03.220> shuts<00:06:03.550> off<00:06:03.789> a<00:06:04.210> certain<00:06:04.990> number<00:06:05.140> of

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
it shuts off a certain number of

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.719 
it shuts off a certain number of
questions<00:06:05.770> it<00:06:05.979> tells<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.280> kind<00:06:06.430> of<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.520> same

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
questions it tells you kind of the same

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.340 
questions it tells you kind of the same
thing<00:06:06.789> like<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.390> nclex<00:06:07.690> like<00:06:07.840> you<00:06:07.930> pass<00:06:08.140> or

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
thing like the nclex like you pass or

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.500 
thing like the nclex like you pass or
you<00:06:08.440> fail<00:06:08.680> or<00:06:08.710> something<00:06:09.190> like<00:06:09.310> that<00:06:09.370> so<00:06:09.640> that

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
you fail or something like that so that

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.870 
you fail or something like that so that
was<00:06:10.630> really<00:06:10.660> really<00:06:11.080> cool<00:06:11.350> um<00:06:11.710> or<00:06:12.100> that<00:06:12.700> would

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
was really really cool um or that would

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.860 
was really really cool um or that would
have<00:06:12.970> been<00:06:13.090> really<00:06:13.150> cool<00:06:13.479> if<00:06:13.570> i<00:06:13.600> could<00:06:13.660> have

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
have been really cool if i could have

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.270 
have been really cool if i could have
used<00:06:13.990> it<00:06:14.140> but<00:06:14.229> i<00:06:14.320> got<00:06:14.500> i<00:06:14.620> do<00:06:14.680> have<00:06:14.890> been<00:06:15.130> that

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
used it but i got i do have been that

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.620 
used it but i got i do have been that
book<00:06:15.460> too<00:06:15.700> it's<00:06:15.880> a<00:06:15.940> really<00:06:16.090> good<00:06:16.270> review<00:06:16.600> i

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
book too it's a really good review i

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.240 
book too it's a really good review i
would<00:06:16.840> probably<00:06:17.229> definitely<00:06:17.380> get<00:06:17.860> one<00:06:18.010> when<00:06:18.160> i

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
would probably definitely get one when i

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.610 
would probably definitely get one when i
start<00:06:18.520> my<00:06:18.610> RN<00:06:18.910> program<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.660> hopefully<00:06:20.470> maybe

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
start my RN program and hopefully maybe

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.450 
start my RN program and hopefully maybe
by<00:06:20.890> then<00:06:21.130> they<00:06:21.669> will<00:06:22.240> have<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:23.050> RN<00:06:23.410> 1cd<00:06:24.220> work

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
by then they will have the RN 1cd work

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.480 
by then they will have the RN 1cd work
for<00:06:24.820> a<00:06:25.260> macintosh<00:06:26.260> but<00:06:26.680> i<00:06:26.830> will<00:06:27.039> get<00:06:27.190> that<00:06:27.340> one

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
for a macintosh but i will get that one

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.730 
for a macintosh but i will get that one
earlier<00:06:27.940> so<00:06:28.270> that<00:06:28.300> i<00:06:28.479> can<00:06:28.660> use<00:06:28.960> at<00:06:29.140> a<00:06:29.169> school<00:06:29.560> or

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
earlier so that i can use at a school or

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.580 
earlier so that i can use at a school or
something<00:06:30.160> you<00:06:30.340> know<00:06:30.370> but<00:06:31.270> um<00:06:31.419> anyways<00:06:32.289> guys
