west side all the fans and the speed
work<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.740> used<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> helped<00:00:18.000> me

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
work that we used to do and it helped me

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
work that we used to do and it helped me
explode<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> hole<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:19.619> more

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
explode out of the hole and not more

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
explode out of the hole and not more
confidence<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.490> heavy<00:00:20.640> weight<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.449> coming

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
confidence with heavy weight but coming

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.700 
confidence with heavy weight but coming
out<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> whole<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> don't<00:00:22.529> feel<00:00:22.680> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
out the whole I don't feel that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
out the whole I don't feel that
confident<00:00:23.430> which<00:00:24.029> means<00:00:24.390> if<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.660> start<00:00:24.869> adding

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
confident which means if I start adding

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.920 
confident which means if I start adding
more<00:00:25.260> weight<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.599> feeling<00:00:27.599> isn't<00:00:27.750> going

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
more weight on that feeling isn't going

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
more weight on that feeling isn't going
to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.080> able<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.410> transition<00:00:28.949> over<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> was

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to be able to transition over and I was

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.560 
to be able to transition over and I was
like<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:30.960> sense<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> bulk<00:00:31.859> easy

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
like you know what sense the bulk easy

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.540 
like you know what sense the bulk easy
method<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.070> supposed<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> hit

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
method is so that you're supposed to hit

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
method is so that you're supposed to hit
a<00:00:35.579> daily<00:00:36.000> maxing<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.510> used<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> was

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
a daily maxing and used to and I was

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.090 
a daily maxing and used to and I was
like<00:00:37.260> technically<00:00:38.239> theoretically

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
like technically theoretically

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
like technically theoretically
philosophically<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.450> throw

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
philosophically we can probably throw

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
philosophically we can probably throw
some<00:00:43.110> bands<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.879> won't<00:00:45.090> affect<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
some bands on and it won't affect the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.770 
some bands on and it won't affect the
method<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.379> long<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.129> fly<00:00:47.399> ourselves

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
method as long as you know fly ourselves

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.430 
method as long as you know fly ourselves
so<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.920> scientists<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.360> took<00:00:51.449> notes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so like way scientists do I took notes

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
so like way scientists do I took notes
of<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.980> did<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> changes<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of what I did and the changes to the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
of what I did and the changes to the
method<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> i<00:00:55.050> did<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.309> i<00:00:56.430> have

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
method that i did so that if i have

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
method that i did so that if i have
positive<00:00:57.059> results<00:00:57.090> another<00:00:57.750> repeat<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.379> i

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
positive results another repeat it if i

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
positive results another repeat it if i
have<00:00:58.590> negative<00:00:58.800> results<00:00:59.309> i<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
have negative results i know not to do

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
have negative results i know not to do
it<00:01:00.480> anymore<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> how<00:01:02.250> new<00:01:02.550> shit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it anymore because that is how new shit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.429 
it anymore because that is how new shit
gets<00:01:03.120> discovered<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.780> experiment<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
gets discovered you got experiment you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.380 
gets discovered you got experiment you
