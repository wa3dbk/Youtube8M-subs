00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:10.309
 That means there is a video for you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.309
 taken today to the topic 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.610
 so far is pretty important environment that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.949
 they so little did us users that he did 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 really that's what's in it 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.910
 Last time is so first of all so 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.960
 one or another scandal surfaced and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 because it is not what it is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 stands on it and as a competitive athlete 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.720
 can not allow such a thing if 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 you after training on 40 grams 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.339
 whey protein and then effectively 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.190
 but only 20 measures twins that 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:06.149
 damn shit and the things designed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.289
 more or less patrick or orders 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.850
 the direction and I have to say you can tell 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.020
 also a little bit the difference one 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 got me this biting funny sweet 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 as they really only limit themselves 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.119
 the minimum and focus more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.390
 on purity and on the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.240
 Effectiveness of the thing good 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 By the way, in my opinion that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.930
 most important and most beautiful moment that is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.760
 it 's just normal whey protein from what 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.619
 I can take as much as I can 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.920
 I think 20 grams after training 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.160
 It's not patrick anymore 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.990
 work less with powder 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.040
 he always says that eating right 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.040
 right one had to give 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.500
 effectively there are 90 grams in here 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.720
 a purity level of 90 percent of mine 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 opinion not bad at all and how 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.230
 said at koloss he is worth it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.509
 that you shit less 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.009
 wraps so it's very chic thing 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.550
 way , of course, everyone has to know that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.920
 of you is simply insufficient or say 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.320
 time to provide effective proteins 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 especially the whey protein way is 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.770
 known for being quite fast in 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 Of course, the organism slips off 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.640
 advantage is if something is after 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.730
 so 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.050
 a beautiful argument i know 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.630
 not if it is but i hate water 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.230
 Can not drink water and that's why 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.510
 it's so great 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.330
 that means you have easy training 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.420
 a drink that tastes good because of that 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.570
 here is no slamming and that's it 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.640
 good because you have nothing 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.500
 better than amino acids available 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 to have in training because in training 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 by bleeding your muscles like 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.410
 at no other time of the day 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.630
 And if you have amino acids in your blood 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.550
 that's dry, of course 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.320
 the special of this year is that 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.350
 ratio 8 to 1 1 means tremendously high 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.350
 is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 that of course has explained it works 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.090
 mainly because of people pulling 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.050
 pretty big role for bodybuilders 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.060
 plays because it cortisolspiegel 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.700
 presses cortisol is normal 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.700
 what to do in bodybuilding 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.290
 rather less likes because it is easy 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 a stress hormone and sisters when I 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.129
 good for muscle and yes how 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.660
 said pulling today makes sure it does 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.720
 a bit lower as well 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.800
 puts the pancreas 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.800
 which of course is not bad 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.340
 then we have the island here in ghent 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.100
 Gent is a powder that is complex 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.090
 carbohydrates and so many 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.900
 of you may be familiar with behind 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.400
 cornstarch 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.400
 it's just a supplement 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.720
 Carbohydrate provides tremendous 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.970
 to push an insulin secretion 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.800
 so it's not that you are that big 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.570
 picasso but it really is that way 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.640
 you keep your body constant 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.450
 that can be delivered in energy 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.890
 combination with the way used in the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.980
 principle simple, each of you knows it 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.940
 probably nothing big so no 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.050
 Secret behind it are let me lie 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.270
 job also 20 i do not know by heart 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.520
 now interesting what a supplement 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.330
 does not need to know before patrick tour 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.460
 I honestly admit 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.390
 that's the ah that's alfa mito me 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.160
 I have to be a little smart, too 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.640
 to be honest, to be honest completely 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.710
 Acid ensures that carbohydrates 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.660
 Constant it was then recorded 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.820
 again a better I sped that out 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.290
 carbohydrates are absorbed a bit slowly 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.940
 that is the insulin peaks are 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.940
 not as high as usual 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.529
 so to speak, they are quite whole 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.089
 sent the crystal it is a good 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.800
 meeting 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.969
 each of us knows to schedule there's 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.110
 another small feature of this 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.009
 nostalgia and just to be honest 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.129
 I did not think that way 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.020
 effective difference gives the normal 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.279
 Glutamine breaks down pretty quickly 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.559
 means you let the new business 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.599
 Half an hour is the fomc or too 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.809
 a certain part of course that's gone 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.779
 not really of advantage the peptide 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.740
 glutamine are much more resistant to those 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.800
 do not break so fast and 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.999
 Do not disintegrate that fast, of course 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.129
 also of advantage is it does not have to 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:50.259
 explain as well is the 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.370
 bioavailability is much higher than 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.110
 when we call 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.930
 are rather the means effectively 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.529
 term of it in your blood or in general 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.490
 Your body is always absorbed 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.800
 spasm 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.589
 that means I always take five and then 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.809
 again 500 again five so several times 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.309
 Of course, the supplement plan on the day 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.099
 you'll find them in the bottom of the page 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.870
 description 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.819
 yes that was the most common 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.529
 supplements without my secret weapon 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.800
 of course the area then a different in 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:24.749
 a new video 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.889
 So again for cornstarch 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:28.330
 By the way the bca stream I not only in the 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.710
 training but the whole day 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.170
 I do not know if I but the 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.850
 I think it's really bad 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:41.120
 dias and the best can then dia 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.200
 Especially not in the morning so I am 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.720
 believe it once enough talked 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.870
 If you have any questions, I believe 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.490
 a colossal nutrition facebook page where 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.050
 You can write to the people on 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.240
 next time will be a German 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.370
 be available version and website 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.960
 then I would like to read one because 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.460
 I am totally convinced of the work 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.570
 the patrick with me makes with the 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.780
 Documenting is really wonderful that way 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.410
 I have not had much appeal yet 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.930
 not used 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.940
 I was rather used to larger quantities altogether 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.200
 simply because of that because of 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.800
 purity probably not like that 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.790
 the highest was so wonderful that I 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.320
 hope you take something with you 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:25.460
 can get some new insights 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:27.140
 then try it before trying 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.510
 I forget to subscribe do not forget
