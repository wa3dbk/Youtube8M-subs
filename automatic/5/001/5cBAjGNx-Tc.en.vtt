to be used in different applications

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.750 
to be used in different applications
there's<00:00:43.409> so<00:00:43.559> many<00:00:43.649> different<00:00:44.100> applications

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there's so many different applications

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
there's so many different applications
that<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.149> should<00:00:45.449> refer<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.839> a<00:00:45.989> chart<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:47.069> I

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that you should refer to a chart but I

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.979 
that you should refer to a chart but I
can<00:00:47.339> give<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.609> a<00:00:47.699> few<00:00:48.059> different<00:00:48.210> instances

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
can give you a few different instances

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
can give you a few different instances
where<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.199> would<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.859> 40<00:00:50.129> 43<00:00:50.460> versus<00:00:51.389> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
where I would use the 40 43 versus the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.539 
where I would use the 40 43 versus the
53<00:00:52.049> 56<00:00:53.510> for<00:00:54.510> instance<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> 40<00:00:55.649> 43<00:00:56.010> I'm

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
53 56 for instance on the 40 43 I'm

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.899 
53 56 for instance on the 40 43 I'm
doing<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.299> skid<00:00:58.139> plate<00:00:58.170> oil<00:00:58.769> tank<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.639> the<00:00:59.760> big

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
doing a skid plate oil tank for the big

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.529 
doing a skid plate oil tank for the big
PM's<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:00.929> two<00:01:01.109> integrated<00:01:01.589> tank<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> oil

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
PM's and two integrated tank and the oil

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
PM's and two integrated tank and the oil
temperatures<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.739> somewhere<00:01:05.190> between

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
temperatures come in somewhere between

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.230 
temperatures come in somewhere between
160<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.360> 200<00:01:06.930> degrees<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> has

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
160 and 200 degrees so because it has

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.920 
160 and 200 degrees so because it has
sustained<00:01:09.990> temperatures<00:01:10.950> above<00:01:11.550> 150<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
sustained temperatures above 150 that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.640 
sustained temperatures above 150 that
doesn't<00:01:13.410> really<00:01:13.650> make<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.550> suitable<00:01:14.910> for<00:01:15.120> the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
doesn't really make it suitable for the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.860 
doesn't really make it suitable for the
5356<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:17.550> say<00:01:17.790> sustained<00:01:18.300> temperatures

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
5356 they say sustained temperatures

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.680 
5356 they say sustained temperatures
over<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> hundred<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.770> fifty<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> should<00:01:21.540> go

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
over a hundred and fifty you should go

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.920 
over a hundred and fifty you should go
back<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> 40<00:01:22.650> 43<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.780> talk

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
back and use the 40 43 so let's talk

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
back and use the 40 43 so let's talk
about<00:01:25.080> another<00:01:25.290> thing<00:01:25.740> maybe<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
about another thing maybe I want to do a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
about another thing maybe I want to do a
mount<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.450> off-road<00:01:27.750> car<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.440> let's<00:01:28.650> say

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
mount on an off-road car and let's say

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.690 
mount on an off-road car and let's say
it's<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.340> 50/50<00:01:30.120> 2h<00:01:30.720> 32<00:01:31.410> aluminum<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.490> want

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's a 50/50 2h 32 aluminum and I want

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's a 50/50 2h 32 aluminum and I want
to<00:01:32.790> well<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.350> 6061-t6<00:01:34.490> bracket<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to well the 6061-t6 bracket to it to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.220 
to well the 6061-t6 bracket to it to
give<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.300> little<00:01:36.480> bit<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.810> tensile

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
give it a little bit more tensile

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.560 
give it a little bit more tensile
strength<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.830> keep<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.940> rigid<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
strength and keep it more rigid on the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.930 
strength and keep it more rigid on the
car<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.400> would<00:01:41.400> choose<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> 53<00:01:42.360> 56<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
car I would choose the 53 56 for that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.149 
car I would choose the 53 56 for that
another<00:01:44.940> reason<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.450> choose<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.840> 53<00:01:46.350> 56<00:01:46.980> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
another reason to choose the 53 56 on

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
another reason to choose the 53 56 on
that<00:01:47.400> process<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.810> you're<00:01:49.080> going<00:01:49.260> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that process was is if you're going to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
that process was is if you're going to
take<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.800> go<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.190> anodized<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.570> 40

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
take it and go have it anodized the 40

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.620 
take it and go have it anodized the 40
43<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.310> show<00:01:53.550> up<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> dissimilar

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
43 will actually show up as a dissimilar

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.960 
43 will actually show up as a dissimilar
metal<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> we'll<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.860> some<00:01:56.070> streaking

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
metal and we'll have some streaking

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.490 
metal and we'll have some streaking
through<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> anodizing<00:01:59.180> the<00:02:00.180> 53<00:02:00.720> 56<00:02:01.320> will

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
through the anodizing the 53 56 will

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
through the anodizing the 53 56 will
show<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.800> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> same<00:02:02.520> color<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:03.000> lee<00:02:03.180> as

for<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.440> have<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> project<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
for that so you have a project and you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.569 
for that so you have a project and you
come<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.050> did<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.039> welding<00:02:11.310> Muslim

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
come out and you did some welding Muslim

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.589 
come out and you did some welding Muslim
40<00:02:11.849> 43<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.749> some<00:02:13.230> 53<00:02:13.739> 56<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.269> burn<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
40 43 and some 53 56 and you burn the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.610 
40 43 and some 53 56 and you burn the
flags<00:02:15.900> off<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and you have them land on the table so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140 
and you have them land on the table so
how<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.230> identify<00:02:19.790> two<00:02:20.790> different

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
how do you identify two different

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.790 
how do you identify two different
welding<00:02:21.420> rods<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.959> be<00:02:22.140> able<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.440> clarify

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
alloying element is magnesium but kind

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.470 
alloying element is magnesium but kind
of<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> touch<00:02:35.400> makes<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.120> welding<00:02:36.450> rod

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
of to the touch makes the welding rod

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.740 
of to the touch makes the welding rod
just<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.379> bit<00:02:37.530> stiffer<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:39.239> harder<00:02:39.629> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
just a little bit stiffer it's harder to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
just a little bit stiffer it's harder to
bend<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.620> little<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.970> bit

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
bend it's a little bit a little bit

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660 
bend it's a little bit a little bit
tougher<00:02:42.720> we'll<00:02:42.900> call<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:44.310> yet<00:02:44.489> it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
tougher we'll call it but yet it's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.039 
tougher we'll call it but yet it's
actually<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.450> ductile<00:02:47.180> welding<00:02:48.180> rod<00:02:48.390> but

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
actually a more ductile welding rod but

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.050 
actually a more ductile welding rod but
what<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.410> does<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.670> do<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> kind

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
what this does is we can just do a kind

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.380 
what this does is we can just do a kind
of<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.209> quick<00:02:51.450> drop<00:02:52.110> test<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> 4043

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
of a quick drop test on it with the 4043

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.370 
of a quick drop test on it with the 4043
it'll<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:54.840> kind<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.140> drop<00:02:55.680> into<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> thud<00:02:57.380> 5356

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it'll just kind of drop into a thud 5356

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.080 
it'll just kind of drop into a thud 5356
will<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> ring<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.910> has

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
will have a ring to it because it has

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.900 
will have a ring to it because it has
the<00:03:00.269> magnesium<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.079> little<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.440> harder

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the magnesium it's a little bit harder

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.900 
the magnesium it's a little bit harder
so<00:03:02.910> we'll<00:03:03.120> drop<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.390> first<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.819> then

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
so we'll drop the first one and then

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.930 
so we'll drop the first one and then
we'll<00:03:06.090> drop<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.360> second<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
we'll drop the second one the one that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
we'll drop the second one the one that
you<00:03:09.180> hear<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> obvious<00:03:10.140> ring<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.799> it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
you hear is the obvious ring and it

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.680 
you hear is the obvious ring and it
actually<00:03:11.220> does<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> couple<00:03:11.819> more<00:03:11.940> bounces<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
actually does a couple more bounces is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.500 
actually does a couple more bounces is
the<00:03:13.129> 5356<00:03:14.129> so<00:03:14.700> that's<00:03:14.879> one<00:03:15.120> way<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.299> identify

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the 5356 so that's one way to identify

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.140 
the 5356 so that's one way to identify
it<00:03:16.110> another<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.819> after<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
it another thing I like to do is after I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.199 
it another thing I like to do is after I
get<00:03:18.269> done<00:03:18.540> welding<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.860> rod<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.430> tagged<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
get done welding if the rod is tagged I

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.900 
get done welding if the rod is tagged I
try<00:03:21.690> not<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.200> burn<00:03:22.500> off<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.739> flag<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.489> don't
