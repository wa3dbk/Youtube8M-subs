00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
glitch and someone actually found a way

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
glitch and someone actually found a way
to<00:00:35.550> actually<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.660> happen

so I'm going to show it to you today by

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
so I'm going to show it to you today by
creating<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.870> new<00:00:39.989> world<00:00:40.700> we'll<00:00:41.700> call<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
creating a new world we'll call it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.740 
creating a new world we'll call it
glitch<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:45.120> still<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:45.390> in

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
glitch and it actually still works in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
glitch and it actually still works in
Minecraft<00:00:46.079> 1.7<00:00:46.739> point<00:00:46.860> eight<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> was

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
Minecraft 1.7 point eight so I was

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
Minecraft 1.7 point eight so I was
surprised<00:00:48.840> by<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.680> like

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
surprised by this because I was like

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
surprised by this because I was like
well<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> probably<00:00:50.190> had<00:00:50.550> been<00:00:50.760> fixed<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.149> now

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
well it probably had been fixed by now

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700 
well it probably had been fixed by now
but<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:51.989> still<00:00:52.199> works<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.559> going

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
but it actually still works so I'm going

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
but it actually still works so I'm going
to<00:00:52.739> show<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.329> we're<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> spawn

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
to show it to you we're going to spawn

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
to show it to you we're going to spawn
in<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.289> negative<00:00:55.800> amount<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> diamonds<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
in a negative amount of diamonds and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.189 
in a negative amount of diamonds and
then<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
then just see what we can do with it so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
then just see what we can do with it so
what<00:00:58.829> you're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.579> grab<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
what you're going to do is first grab a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.959 
what you're going to do is first grab a
bucket<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> water<00:01:01.640> basically<00:01:02.640> things<00:01:02.850> will

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
bucket of water basically things will

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.429 
bucket of water basically things will
move<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.270> bucket<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> water<00:01:03.809> stone

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.440 

redstone<00:01:07.439> redstone<00:01:07.650> repeaters<00:01:08.340> block<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
redstone redstone repeaters block of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
redstone redstone repeaters block of
redstone<00:01:09.659> although<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.619> other<00:01:10.799> ways<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
redstone although there's other ways to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.020 
redstone although there's other ways to
do<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.820> redstone<00:01:12.240> clock<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.320> course

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
do the redstone clock and then of course

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.660 
do the redstone clock and then of course
I<00:01:15.140> got<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.350> mic<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> can't<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.490> the

I got my mic in the way I can't see the
screen<00:01:18.450> over<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.229> Sukkah<00:01:20.130> p13

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
screen over here we got a Sukkah p13

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.590 
screen over here we got a Sukkah p13
seven<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.630> command<00:01:21.960> block<00:01:22.170> oh<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:23.600> they

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
seven for command block oh right they

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
seven for command block oh right they
took<00:01:24.840> away<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> ids<00:01:25.710> okay<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.680> I'm<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
took away the ids okay so I'm going to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
took away the ids okay so I'm going to
say<00:01:29.130> slick<00:01:29.640> Nick<00:01:30.060> P<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.049> give<00:01:31.200> yourself<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
say slick Nick P so give yourself a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
say slick Nick P so give yourself a
command<00:01:31.619> block<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
command block and you can do that and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.090 
command block and you can do that and
now<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.659> need<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.530> first<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
now what we need to do is first just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
now what we need to do is first just
make<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.790> structure<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.240> here

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
make this little structure right here

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.550 
make this little structure right here
we're<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:37.829> far<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.250> need

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
we're going to go out as far as we need

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.140 
we're going to go out as far as we need
and<00:01:40.560> we'll<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.950> how<00:01:41.100> far<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.759> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and we'll see how far that's to go so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
and we'll see how far that's to go so
you<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.899> keep<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.470> until<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> see

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you just keep going out until I can see

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
you just keep going out until I can see
them<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.290> we'll

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
them to this so up to then and we'll

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.950 
them to this so up to then and we'll
just<00:01:46.860> close<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.399> real<00:01:47.610> quick<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
just close this out real quick and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.990 
just close this out real quick and
so<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.860> our<00:01:51.010> main<00:01:51.160> structure<00:01:51.670> basically

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
so this is our main structure basically

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.340 
so this is our main structure basically
that's<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.420> we've<00:01:52.570> already<00:01:52.750> finished<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.290> I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
that's it we've already finished it I

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.480 
that's it we've already finished it I
always<00:01:53.440> have<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.740> put<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.040> command<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
always have to put in the command so

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.180 
always have to put in the command so
let's<00:01:54.940> go<00:01:55.090> put<00:01:55.300> down<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.570> real<00:01:55.780> fast<00:01:56.190> I'm

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
let's go put down this real fast I'm

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.220 
let's go put down this real fast I'm
just<00:01:57.400> gonna<00:01:57.490> make<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:57.790> quick<00:01:58.120> simple<00:01:58.540> setup<00:01:58.870> you

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
did so yeah this is the setup so I'm

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.660 
did so yeah this is the setup so I'm
going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.560> go<00:02:08.679> back<00:02:08.860> over<00:02:09.100> here<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.550> these

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
going to go back over here so these

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.830 
going to go back over here so these
slimes<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.179> way<00:02:10.300> they<00:02:10.420> won't<00:02:10.539> affect

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
slimes in the way they won't affect

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.320 
slimes in the way they won't affect
anything<00:02:11.110> go<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.040> f3<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.910> can<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.180> our

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
anything go to f3 and you can see our

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.190 
anything go to f3 and you can see our
XYZ<00:02:14.020> there<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:14.650> go<00:02:14.740> here<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.100> type<00:02:15.280> slash

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
XYZ there we go here we type slash

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
XYZ there we go here we type slash
summon<00:02:17.700> space<00:02:18.700> item<00:02:20.010> space<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.640> have

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
summon space item space and then we have

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.020 
summon space item space and then we have
to<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.970> XYZ<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.930> where<00:02:23.140> we're<00:02:23.290> standing<00:02:23.530> is

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to the XYZ so where we're standing is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.260 
to the XYZ so where we're standing is
negative<00:02:25.030> seven<00:02:25.720> eight<00:02:25.989> seven<00:02:26.850> space<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
negative seven eight seven space and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.479 
negative seven eight seven space and
then<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:30.340> Y<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.030> -<00:02:31.570> eight<00:02:31.780> -<00:02:32.050> for<00:02:33.010> Z

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
then for for Y and then - eight - for Z

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.440 
then for for Y and then - eight - for Z
and<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.500> go<00:02:35.650> here

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
and then we have to go here

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.440 
and then we have to go here
item<00:02:37.450> :<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.820> then<00:02:40.560> we'll<00:02:41.560> do<00:02:42.300> we're<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.390> to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
item : and then we'll do we're going to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.350 
item : and then we'll do we're going to
do<00:02:43.630> ID<00:02:43.989> let's<00:02:44.860> say<00:02:44.980> uh<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.459> ID<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.940> diamonds

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
do ID let's say uh the ID for diamonds

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.900 
do ID let's say uh the ID for diamonds
is<00:02:46.690> two<00:02:47.140> six<00:02:47.470> four<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.489> we're<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.820> do

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
is two six four so we're going to do

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.979 
is two six four so we're going to do
that<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.209> we<00:02:49.300> might<00:02:49.450> try<00:02:49.630> something<00:02:49.930> else

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
that but we might try something else

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.710 
that but we might try something else
later<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:51.100> count<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:54.330> hundred<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.570> then

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
later and then count to hundred and then

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.000 
later and then count to hundred and then
another<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.080> these<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.799> more<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
another one of these and one more to

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.530 
another one of these and one more to
fish<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.310> off<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:58.320> our<00:02:59.519> command<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
fish it off so this is our command so

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.850 
fish it off so this is our command so
now<00:03:01.690> all<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.019> have<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:04.440> put<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.560> here

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
now all we have to do is a put in here

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.699 
now all we have to do is a put in here
and<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:07.570> going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> spawn<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.080> bunch<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.410> items

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
and it's going to spawn a bunch of items

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.199 
and it's going to spawn a bunch of items
right<00:03:08.799> here<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.190> it's<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.459> glitched<00:03:09.790> when<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
right here and it's so glitched when it

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.120 
right here and it's so glitched when it
goes<00:03:10.360> into<00:03:10.570> water<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.530> actually<00:03:11.739> makes

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
goes into water that it actually makes

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.410 
goes into water that it actually makes
them<00:03:12.310> negative<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:12.970> I'm<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.269> show<00:03:13.390> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
them negative so I'm going to show you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.970 
them negative so I'm going to show you
real<00:03:13.690> quick<00:03:13.900> we're<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.620> put<00:03:14.709> water<00:03:14.830> here

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
real quick we're going to put water here

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.830 
real quick we're going to put water here
it's<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> go<00:03:15.519> down<00:03:15.730> maybe<00:03:16.630> get<00:03:16.750> our

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
it's going to go down maybe get our

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.970 
it's going to go down maybe get our
block<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.230> redstone<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.709> then<00:03:17.830> we're<00:03:17.950> just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
block of redstone and then we're just

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.460 
block of redstone and then we're just
going<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.660> going<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.810> spam<00:03:20.170> as

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
going to do that it's going to spam as

going to do that it's going to spam as
you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.830> see<00:03:20.950> spamming<00:03:21.370> me<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:22.390> if<00:03:22.720> we

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
you can see spamming me and then if we

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.350 
you can see spamming me and then if we
stand<00:03:23.110> here<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:24.640> giving<00:03:25.000> us<00:03:25.090> negative

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
stand here it's giving us negative

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.060 
stand here it's giving us negative
diamonds<00:03:25.989> look<00:03:26.110> down<00:03:26.290> there<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.560> my<00:03:26.590> half<00:03:26.830> bar

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
diamonds look down there on my half bar

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.270 
diamonds look down there on my half bar
and<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.720> flying<00:03:29.080> out<00:03:29.320> here<00:03:29.560> but

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
and there it is like flying out here but

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.100 
and there it is like flying out here but
it's<00:03:30.459> giving<00:03:30.790> me<00:03:30.910> negative<00:03:31.180> diamonds<00:03:31.930> which

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
it's giving me negative diamonds which

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's giving me negative diamonds which
is<00:03:32.230> amazing<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:32.860> look<00:03:33.040> at<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.209> that's

is amazing so look at that that's

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.270 
is amazing so look at that that's
basically<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.810> glitch<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.140> mean<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.769> still

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
basically the glitch I mean it still

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.580

actually<00:03:48.579> like<00:03:48.700> covering<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.269> command<00:03:49.660> block

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
actually like covering the command block

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.500 
actually like covering the command block
next<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.010> badly<00:03:51.730> glitch<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.390> is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
there is just going off the screen let's

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.879 
there is just going off the screen let's
see<00:03:57.250> what<00:03:57.370> happens<00:03:57.610> if<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.870> add<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.930> diamond<00:03:59.709> to

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
see what happens if we add a diamond to

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.620 
see what happens if we add a diamond to
it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.550

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
just add hyphens and adds the back now

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.020 
just add hyphens and adds the back now
it's<00:04:06.750> less<00:04:06.930> negative<00:04:07.140> always<00:04:07.680> fun<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.970> is

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
it's less negative always fun this is

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.520 
it's less negative always fun this is
amazing<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.870> looks<00:04:10.050> like<00:04:10.230> when<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> get

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
amazing and it looks like when I get

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.040 
amazing and it looks like when I get
here<00:04:10.920> why<00:04:11.700> does<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.090> make<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.300> second<00:04:12.810> stack

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
here why does just make a second stack

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.530 
here why does just make a second stack
is<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.610> seen<00:04:14.940> go<00:04:15.060> cut<00:04:15.270> put<00:04:15.420> them

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
is that what I seen go cut put them

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.780 
is that what I seen go cut put them
together<00:04:15.860> okay<00:04:16.860> that's<00:04:17.280> weird

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
together okay that's weird

together okay that's weird
this<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.150> obviously<00:04:18.540> glitch<00:04:19.040> that's<00:04:20.040> amazing

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
this is obviously glitch that's amazing

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.200 
this is obviously glitch that's amazing
now<00:04:20.670> let's<00:04:21.330> try<00:04:21.420> something<00:04:21.660> else<00:04:21.840> let's<00:04:22.170> try

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
now let's try something else let's try

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.330 
now let's try something else let's try
let's<00:04:24.210> try<00:04:24.300> wool<00:04:24.750> let's<00:04:25.620> see<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.950> works<00:04:26.130> for

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
let's try wool let's see if it works for

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.930 
let's try wool let's see if it works for
a<00:04:26.370> wool

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.310 

indeed<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.090> does<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.480> works<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:30.810> any<00:04:30.990> item

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
indeed it does it works for any item

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.570 
indeed it does it works for any item
this<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.680> amazing

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
this is that amazing

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.190 
this is that amazing
let's<00:04:33.030> do<00:04:33.120> command<00:04:33.420> block<00:04:33.600> let's<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:33.900> command

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
let's do command block let's do command

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600 
let's do command block let's do command
block<00:04:34.380> let's<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:34.680> negative<00:04:35.070> command<00:04:35.370> blocks

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
block let's get negative command blocks

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.550 
block let's get negative command blocks
up<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:35.910> here<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.810> three<00:04:37.020> seven<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:39.240> yeah<00:04:39.560> there

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
up in here one three seven so yeah there

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.230 
up in here one three seven so yeah there
you<00:04:40.710> go<00:04:40.740> negative<00:04:41.220> command<00:04:41.730> blocks<00:04:41.970> just

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
you go negative command blocks just

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.130 
you go negative command blocks just
flying<00:04:42.480> everywhere

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
flying everywhere

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.500 
flying everywhere

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.910 
yeah that's a glitch pretty much that's
all<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.270> want<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.540> show<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:28.530> think<00:05:28.650> it's

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
all I want to show you but I think it's

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.070 
all I want to show you but I think it's
really<00:05:29.130> cool<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.720> do<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:30.990> yourself

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
really cool and you can do it yourself

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.360 
really cool and you can do it yourself
you<00:05:31.410> just<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.740> have<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.980> go<00:05:32.100> into<00:05:32.340> a

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
you just have to have it go into a

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.160 
you just have to have it go into a
running<00:05:32.730> water<00:05:32.910> source<00:05:33.210> let<00:05:33.810> me<00:05:33.870> see<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.080> it

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
running water source let me see if it

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.510 
running water source let me see if it
works<00:05:34.350> without<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.650> running<00:05:34.950> water<00:05:35.040> source<00:05:35.370> I

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
works without the running water source I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.670 
works without the running water source I
would<00:05:35.670> think<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.420> just<00:05:37.050> works<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.650> should

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
would think it just works like it should

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.300 
would think it just works like it should
know<00:05:38.520> it's<00:05:38.700> still<00:05:38.910> doing<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:40.100> it's<00:05:41.100> still

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
know it's still doing that it's still

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.550 
know it's still doing that it's still
doing<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:41.960> I'm<00:05:42.960> always<00:05:43.110> scared<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.500> the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
doing that I'm always scared of the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.240 
doing that I'm always scared of the
water<00:05:43.680> just<00:05:44.520> like<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.850> water<00:05:45.030> even<00:05:45.450> matter<00:05:46.250> or

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
water just like the water even matter or

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.640 
water just like the water even matter or
is<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.460> just<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.670> messed<00:05:47.880> up<00:05:48.000> command<00:05:48.560> what<00:05:49.560> if

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
is it just a messed up command what if

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.810 
is it just a messed up command what if
we<00:05:49.710> just<00:05:49.920> do<00:05:50.100> like<00:05:51.770> now<00:05:52.770> I'm<00:05:52.920> curious<00:05:53.160> okay<00:05:53.640> I'm

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
we just do like now I'm curious okay I'm

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.860 
we just do like now I'm curious okay I'm
going<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.000> keep<00:05:54.150> going<00:05:54.330> with<00:05:54.450> this<00:05:54.570> video

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
going to keep going with this video

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.200 
going to keep going with this video
we're<00:05:55.380> doing<00:05:55.590> some<00:05:55.740> science<00:05:55.920> now<00:05:56.220> let's<00:05:56.910> move

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
we're doing some science now let's move

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:06.550 
we're doing some science now let's move
the<00:05:58.190> Z<00:05:59.600> to<00:06:02.330> 260<00:06:04.100> so<00:06:05.100> let's<00:06:05.400> try<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.510> then

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
the Z to 260 so let's try that and then

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.170 
the Z to 260 so let's try that and then
we'll<00:06:07.560> change<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.980> item<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.730> something<00:06:09.120> I

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
we'll change the item to something I

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.720 
we'll change the item to something I
haven't<00:06:09.330> done<00:06:09.420> yet<00:06:09.540> let's<00:06:10.080> just<00:06:10.260> do<00:06:10.490> um<00:06:13.730> let's

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
haven't done yet let's just do um let's

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.030 
haven't done yet let's just do um let's
do<00:06:14.850> 5<00:06:15.180> that's<00:06:15.660> I<00:06:16.080> don't<00:06:16.530> remember<00:06:16.650> well<00:06:16.860> block

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
do 5 that's I don't remember well block

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.000 
do 5 that's I don't remember well block
that<00:06:17.220> is<00:06:17.370> but<00:06:17.610> let's<00:06:17.640> try<00:06:17.910> that<00:06:18.320> okay<00:06:19.320> so<00:06:19.380> it's

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
that is but let's try that okay so it's

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.280 
that is but let's try that okay so it's
doing<00:06:20.460> them<00:06:20.580> over<00:06:20.790> here<00:06:21.060> now<00:06:21.240> here<00:06:21.600> it<00:06:21.690> is<00:06:21.780> it's

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
doing them over here now here it is it's

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.490 
doing them over here now here it is it's
dirt<00:06:22.560> or<00:06:23.100> no<00:06:23.280> it's<00:06:23.460> wood<00:06:23.960> it's<00:06:24.960> doing<00:06:25.320> it<00:06:25.410> again

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
dirt or no it's wood it's doing it again

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.620 
dirt or no it's wood it's doing it again
okay<00:06:26.220> I<00:06:26.250> stand<00:06:26.760> corrected<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.360> water

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
okay I stand corrected the water

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.270 
okay I stand corrected the water
actually<00:06:28.020> has<00:06:28.350> nothing<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.680> do<00:06:28.830> with<00:06:28.860> it<00:06:29.130> it's

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
actually has nothing to do with it it's

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.340 
actually has nothing to do with it it's
just<00:06:29.430> a<00:06:29.520> messed<00:06:29.730> up<00:06:29.820> command<00:06:30.240> I<00:06:30.480> don't<00:06:31.200> know

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
just a messed up command I don't know

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.930 
just a messed up command I don't know
why<00:06:31.590> this<00:06:31.800> youtuber<00:06:32.250> said<00:06:32.400> I<00:06:32.430> had<00:06:32.610> to<00:06:32.700> do<00:06:32.820> in

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
why this youtuber said I had to do in

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.980 
why this youtuber said I had to do in

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
the water

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.810 
the water
it<00:06:34.320> basically<00:06:34.500> is<00:06:35.040> glitched<00:06:35.400> out<00:06:35.610> wherever

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
it basically is glitched out wherever

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.000 
it basically is glitched out wherever
you<00:06:36.030> do<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:36.570> yeah<00:06:36.990> just<00:06:37.260> do<00:06:37.380> this<00:06:37.560> come<00:06:37.830> in

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010

that's it that's all you need to do it's

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.930 
that's it that's all you need to do it's
just<00:06:40.140> completely<00:06:40.500> screwed<00:06:40.980> up<00:06:41.100> maybe<00:06:41.760> it's

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
just completely screwed up maybe it's

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.280 
just completely screwed up maybe it's
because<00:06:42.030> there's<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.330> capital<00:06:42.720> I<00:06:42.810> I<00:06:42.840> don't<00:06:43.110> know

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
because there's a capital I I don't know

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.230 
because there's a capital I I don't know
I<00:06:43.350> wonder<00:06:43.770> why<00:06:43.920> this<00:06:44.250> is<00:06:44.370> so<00:06:44.520> weird<00:06:44.790> but<00:06:44.940> look<00:06:45.120> I

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
just got like negative wood right now

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.810 
just got like negative wood right now
it's<00:06:47.190> amazing<00:06:47.670> and<00:06:48.410> we<00:06:49.410> can<00:06:49.650> just<00:06:49.800> like<00:06:50.010> keep

see<00:06:52.440> if<00:06:52.500> we<00:06:52.620> can<00:06:52.830> go<00:06:53.640> faster<00:06:54.030> whoa<00:06:54.830> can<00:06:55.830> I<00:06:55.890> like

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
see if we can go faster whoa can I like

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.760 
see if we can go faster whoa can I like
split<00:06:56.610> okay<00:06:56.940> can't<00:06:57.180> split<00:06:57.590> taking<00:06:58.590> like

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
split okay can't split taking like

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.290 
split okay can't split taking like
stacks<00:06:59.010> together<00:06:59.340> that<00:06:59.580> is<00:06:59.700> so<00:06:59.730> bizarre<00:07:00.090> and

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
stacks together that is so bizarre and

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.730 
stacks together that is so bizarre and
then<00:07:00.660> they<00:07:00.780> just<00:07:00.930> disappear<00:07:01.380> when<00:07:01.470> you<00:07:01.500> punch

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
then they just disappear when you punch

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.830 
then they just disappear when you punch
something<00:07:02.100> how<00:07:02.640> amazing<00:07:03.120> is<00:07:03.240> that<00:07:03.270> to<00:07:03.630> glitch

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
something how amazing is that to glitch

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.090 
something how amazing is that to glitch
it<00:07:04.020> works<00:07:04.200> at<00:07:04.320> one<00:07:04.410> point<00:07:04.560> eight<00:07:04.710> point<00:07:04.890> seven

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
it works at one point eight point seven

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.910 
it works at one point eight point seven
and<00:07:05.660> I<00:07:06.660> mean<00:07:06.870> it<00:07:07.020> didn't<00:07:07.260> look<00:07:07.350> like<00:07:07.410> one<00:07:07.710> point

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
and I mean it didn't look like one point

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.350 
and I mean it didn't look like one point
eight<00:07:08.010> when<00:07:08.160> this<00:07:08.280> guy<00:07:08.430> was<00:07:08.550> doing<00:07:08.790> it<00:07:08.910> so<00:07:09.090> this

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
eight when this guy was doing it so this

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.670 
eight when this guy was doing it so this
