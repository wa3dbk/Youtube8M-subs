really hot this season there's so many
different<00:00:06.569> ways<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.720> can<00:00:07.020> design<00:00:07.200> them<00:00:07.589> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
different ways you can design them and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.140 
different ways you can design them and
they<00:00:07.830> look<00:00:07.980> great<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.189> just<00:00:08.490> about<00:00:08.700> anybody

they look great on just about anybody
the<00:00:09.990> best<00:00:10.200> thing<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.500> if<00:00:10.650> they're<00:00:10.800> easy<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
the best thing is if they're easy to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.200 
the best thing is if they're easy to
make<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.400> bulk<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.820> they<00:00:11.910> aren't<00:00:12.120> too

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
make in bulk and they aren't too

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.299 
make in bulk and they aren't too
difficult<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.750> make<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
difficult to make so we're just going to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.680 
difficult to make so we're just going to
show<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.639> few<00:00:14.849> different<00:00:14.940> kinds<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.509> them

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
show you a few different kinds of them

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210 
show you a few different kinds of them
including<00:00:16.500> different<00:00:16.680> tricks<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
including different tricks and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
techniques you can use to make your

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.890 
techniques you can use to make your
design<00:00:19.020> stand<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:20.300> these<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> standard

plain<00:00:27.180> ones<00:00:27.390> without<00:00:27.539> stones<00:00:27.930> you'd<00:00:28.170> probably

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
plain ones without stones you'd probably

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.310 
plain ones without stones you'd probably
just<00:00:28.880> engrave<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> name<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> message<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just engrave a name or a message on to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.459 
just engrave a name or a message on to
them<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> these<00:00:32.550> ones<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.910> diamonds

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
them and these ones with diamonds

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
them and these ones with diamonds
they're<00:00:34.469> pretty<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:34.980> ready<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.399> wear<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
they're pretty much ready to wear and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690 
they're pretty much ready to wear and
they<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> design<00:00:37.020> themselves<00:00:37.579> we<00:00:38.579> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
they kind of design themselves we can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459 
they kind of design themselves we can
still<00:00:38.940> add<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.239> accents<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> kind<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
still add some accents to it to kind of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
still add some accents to it to kind of
liven<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.250> little<00:00:41.370> bit<00:00:41.930> one<00:00:42.930> trick<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
liven it up a little bit one trick that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
liven it up a little bit one trick that
we<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.800> instead<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.700> putting

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we can do is instead of just putting

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.229 
we can do is instead of just putting
jump<00:00:45.329> rings<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.739> plain<00:00:47.239> we

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
jump rings here it's just so plain we

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.990 
jump rings here it's just so plain we
can<00:00:48.390> wire<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.230> small<00:00:49.890> faceted<00:00:50.399> bead<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can wire up a small faceted bead just to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
can wire up a small faceted bead just to
give<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.270> bit<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> sparkle<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.320> nice

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
give a little bit of sparkle a nice

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.380 
give a little bit of sparkle a nice
little<00:00:52.980> accent<00:00:53.399> maybe<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.090> more<00:00:54.300> color<00:00:55.010> or

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
little accent maybe some more color or

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.869 
little accent maybe some more color or
we<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:58.100> some<00:00:59.100> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> bead<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.730> put

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we can use some kind of a bead and put

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.599 
we can use some kind of a bead and put
it<00:00:59.969> directly<00:01:00.030> onto<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.930> chain<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it directly onto the chain like I have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.370 
it directly onto the chain like I have
use<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.619> little<00:01:04.619> cz<00:01:04.979> round<00:01:05.220> dose<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.930> know

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
use a little cz round dose and you know

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
use a little cz round dose and you know
instantly<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.400> tell<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> difference

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
instantly you can tell the difference

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
instantly you can tell the difference
it's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> bling<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.850> too<00:01:12.030> much

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's a little bit of bling not too much

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's a little bit of bling not too much
just<00:01:13.369> makes<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> stand<00:01:14.670> out<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.060> bit

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just makes it stand out a little bit

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
just makes it stand out a little bit
more<00:01:18.049> another<00:01:19.049> type<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> bar<00:01:19.619> necklace<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> one

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
more another type of bar necklace is one

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
more another type of bar necklace is one
where<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> take<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.970> beads<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.009> why<00:01:23.009> wrap

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
where you take the beads and why wrap

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
where you take the beads and why wrap
them<00:01:23.460> together<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.900> basically<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
them together what we do is basically we

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.070 
them together what we do is basically we
take<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> wire<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> wrap<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> chain<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
take a wire and wrap it to the chain and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
take a wire and wrap it to the chain and
then<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.680> add<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> beads<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> close<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> on

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
then we add the beads and close it on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020 
then we add the beads and close it on
the<00:01:30.000> other<00:01:30.119> side<00:01:30.710> just<00:01:31.710> keep<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.549> mind<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.790> hard

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the other side just keep in mind a hard

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
the other side just keep in mind a hard
wire<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.540> better<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> soft<00:01:34.770> wire

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
wire is better for this and soft wire

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.880 
wire is better for this and soft wire
because<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.450> holds<00:01:36.780> its<00:01:36.900> shape<00:01:36.960> better<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because it holds its shape better it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.690 
because it holds its shape better it
keeps<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> nice<00:01:38.549> shape<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:40.350> method<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
keeps this nice shape this method for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
keeps this nice shape this method for
wire<00:01:41.880> wrapping<00:01:41.909> gives<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> lot<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.140> room

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
wire wrapping gives you a lot more room

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
wire wrapping gives you a lot more room
to<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.680> creative<00:01:43.850> because<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.240> many

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to be creative because there's so many

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
to be creative because there's so many
different<00:01:45.450> types<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.990> beads<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.439> use<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
different types of beads you can use I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.139 
different types of beads you can use I
use<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.420> pave<00:01:48.930> cz<00:01:49.470> beads<00:01:49.740> cubic<00:01:50.700> zirconium

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
use the pave cz beads cubic zirconium

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240 
use the pave cz beads cubic zirconium
beads<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.829> pearls

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
beads for this but you can use pearls

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.850 
beads for this but you can use pearls
you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.750> semi-precious<00:01:54.750> gemstones<00:01:55.500> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
you can use semi-precious gemstones you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.609 
you can use semi-precious gemstones you
can<00:01:56.040> use<00:01:56.360> metal<00:01:57.360> beads<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> mix<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
can use metal beads you can mix and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.469 
can use metal beads you can mix and
match<00:01:58.680> whatever<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.090> whatever<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
match whatever you can do whatever you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.880 
match whatever you can do whatever you
like<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.860> great<00:02:03.469> another<00:02:04.469> thing<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like and that's great another thing is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
like and that's great another thing is
that<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.490> bar<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.030> doesn't<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> be

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that this bar it doesn't have to be

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.459 
that this bar it doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:02:07.020> straight

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
perfectly straight

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.820 
perfectly straight
you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.399> curve<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.360> bit

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you can curve it a little bit

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.240 
you can curve it a little bit
and<00:02:11.830> curb<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.860> hangs<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.220> little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and curb it so that it hangs a little

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.270 
and curb it so that it hangs a little
bit<00:02:18.520> nicer<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.270> can<00:02:19.480> actually<00:02:20.140> make<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> into

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
bit nicer you can actually make it into

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.390 
bit nicer you can actually make it into
a<00:02:22.120> straight<00:02:22.750> angle<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> triangle<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
a straight angle like a triangle or a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
a straight angle like a triangle or a
rectangle<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.390> some<00:02:26.140> other<00:02:26.320> crazy<00:02:26.680> shape<00:02:27.070> I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
rectangle or some other crazy shape I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.990 
rectangle or some other crazy shape I
like<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.200> method<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.680> lot<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.760> looks

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
like this method a lot and it looks

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.380 
like this method a lot and it looks
awesome

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
awesome

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.150 
awesome
the<00:02:34.390> last<00:02:34.600> trick<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.410> using<00:02:35.890> parts

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
the last trick I have is using parts

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.550 
the last trick I have is using parts
that<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.400> meant<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:37.060> other<00:02:37.270> things<00:02:37.560> I'm

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that are meant for other things I'm

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.640 
that are meant for other things I'm
talking<00:02:38.950> about<00:02:39.040> these<00:02:40.290> dividers<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.440> are

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
talking about these dividers that are

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920 
talking about these dividers that are
meant<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:41.950> multi<00:02:42.760> strand<00:02:43.150> bracelets<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
meant for multi strand bracelets and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.670 
meant for multi strand bracelets and
necklaces<00:02:45.090> these<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.270> used<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.290> keep<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
necklaces these are used to keep the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.340 
necklaces these are used to keep the
spacing<00:02:47.950> between<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.459> beads<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.240> same<00:02:49.480> but

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
spacing between the beads the same but

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.870 
spacing between the beads the same but
they're<00:02:50.650> great<00:02:50.830> for<00:02:50.980> bar<00:02:51.160> necklaces<00:02:51.670> because

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
they're great for bar necklaces because

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.220 
they're great for bar necklaces because
they're<00:02:52.150> already<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.510> shape<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.750> we<00:02:52.930> want

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
they're already the shape that we want

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.620 
they're already the shape that we want
and<00:02:53.620> they<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.340> holes<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:54.910> them<00:02:55.030> already<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
and they have holes in them already and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.160 
and they have holes in them already and
best<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.800> all<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.310> haven't<00:02:57.880> seen<00:02:58.060> anybody<00:02:58.270> do

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
best of all I haven't seen anybody do

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.210 
best of all I haven't seen anybody do
this<00:02:59.380> design<00:02:59.920> yet<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:02.010> you're<00:03:03.010> kind<00:03:03.160> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
this design yet so you're kind of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.740 
this design yet so you're kind of
getting<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.550> jam-packed<00:03:03.760> exclusive<00:03:04.540> right

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
getting a jam-packed exclusive right

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.140 
getting a jam-packed exclusive right
here<00:03:05.190> maybe<00:03:06.190> things<00:03:06.430> will<00:03:06.550> change<00:03:06.610> after<00:03:07.060> this

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
here maybe things will change after this

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.840 
here maybe things will change after this
video<00:03:07.420> comes<00:03:07.660> out<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.020> don't<00:03:08.380> know<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.670> saw

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
video comes out I don't know but you saw

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.699 
video comes out I don't know but you saw
it<00:03:09.880> here<00:03:10.150> first

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
it here first

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.710 
it here first
the<00:03:12.010> way<00:03:12.130> we<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.760> basically<00:03:13.240> we<00:03:13.510> just

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the way we do it is basically we just

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680 
the way we do it is basically we just
take<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.990> wire<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.910> make<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> normal<00:03:16.480> wire

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
take the wire and we make a normal wire

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.910 
take the wire and we make a normal wire
wrap<00:03:16.989> on<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:18.610> outside<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.500> goes<00:03:20.709> through

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
wrap on the outside so it goes through

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.880 
wrap on the outside so it goes through
the<00:03:21.010> chain<00:03:21.450> through<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.630> hole<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.050> on<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
the chain through the hole and on to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.479 
the chain through the hole and on to
whatever<00:03:24.780> bead<00:03:25.780> or<00:03:26.080> pendant<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.920> have<00:03:27.130> I

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
whatever bead or pendant that you have I

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.220 
whatever bead or pendant that you have I
use<00:03:28.300> these<00:03:28.540> flat<00:03:28.870> diamond<00:03:29.590> ones<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:31.230> they

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
use these flat diamond ones and they

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.650 
use these flat diamond ones and they
look<00:03:32.470> great<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.550> can<00:03:33.700> use<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.000> drop<00:03:34.269> bead

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
look great I you can use that drop bead

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.550 
look great I you can use that drop bead
also<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.170> round<00:03:35.530> bead<00:03:35.970> whatever<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:38.470> do

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
also a round bead whatever and we do

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.190 
also a round bead whatever and we do
that<00:03:38.769> using<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.820> wire<00:03:39.970> only<00:03:40.239> on<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.750> outside

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that using the wire only on the outside

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.870 
that using the wire only on the outside
where<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.280> connects<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> chain<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.760> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
where it connects to the chain for the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.240 
where it connects to the chain for the
Center<00:03:46.239> ones<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.750> use<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> head<00:03:47.200> pin<00:03:47.410> because

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
Center ones we use a head pin because

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.970 
Center ones we use a head pin because
there's<00:03:48.610> no<00:03:48.730> chains<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> connect<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
there's no chains to connect it to it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.580 
there's no chains to connect it to it
just<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.940> pepper<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.930> head<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.350> right

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
just the pepper the the head is right

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.100 
just the pepper the the head is right
here<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.640> wire<00:03:55.209> up<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.540> loop<00:03:55.690> onto<00:03:55.870> it

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
here and you wire up the loop onto it

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.610 
here and you wire up the loop onto it
right<00:03:56.230> there<00:03:59.040> and<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.720> method<00:04:02.110> also<00:04:02.260> works

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
right there and this method also works

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.780 
right there and this method also works
on<00:04:03.010> dividers<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:05.370> stones<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.580> them

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
on dividers that have stones in them

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.240
