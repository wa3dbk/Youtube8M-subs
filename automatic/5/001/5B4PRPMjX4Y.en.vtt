00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hello the other day, you gave me a gift 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.360
 huge pumpkin and I'll prepare a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 super simple cream for 4 people 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.039
 we need a kilo of pumpkin and what 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.039
 first thing we do is peel it 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.160
 i 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.160
 and then surround it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.339
 today 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.339
 good 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 Y 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.830
 we put a saucepan to the fire with abundant 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.040
 extra virgin olive oil and when 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.450
 it's hot we add the pumpkin and the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.450
 sautÃ© about 5 minutes 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.879
 after that time we will add a little 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.879
 of cumin 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.970
 a pinch of salt and pepper 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.560
 and we remove it and let it sautÃ© 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 another five minutes plus this recipe is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.180
 a version of one that I've seen in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.549
 queen magazine and the originality is that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.259
 It is done with very little water as you see 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.740
 when it takes and ten minutes add 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 water but very little we barely cover the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 pumpkin and let it cook until 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.480
 be well tender 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.700
 if the water has been consumed and is not 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.830
 list everything because we add a little 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.830
 more and like that until it's soft 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 and in that moment we beat it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.650
 and this is that easy and how is it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.290
 So simple recipe in a couple of days 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 I play another to make up for good I hope 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 that you have enjoyed a hug until 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.970
 then
