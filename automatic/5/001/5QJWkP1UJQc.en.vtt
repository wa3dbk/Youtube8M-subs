00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
definitely did a pretty good job the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.560 
definitely did a pretty good job the
thing<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.650> trashed<00:01:04.339> these<00:01:04.820> Jeter's<00:01:05.330> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.100 
them so that dirt has just been sitting
there<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.790> when<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.120> do<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.690> becomes<00:01:11.780> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
there and when you do that it becomes a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.410 
there and when you do that it becomes a
lot<00:01:12.350> tougher<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.860> clean<00:01:13.130> say<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:13.909> rocked
