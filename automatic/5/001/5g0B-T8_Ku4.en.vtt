00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.220
 Welcome to my place today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.250
 I eat delicious cake without soil and that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.289
 this time with apples on it and cinnamon and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.699
 sugar so we know that 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:25.279
 and we need the following ingredients 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:28.650
 we need two pudding powder packets 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:34.290
 two teaspoons baking powder 1 packet 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.809
 vanilla sugar four eggs a butter one 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 half lemon so the juice of it or 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 the rent depending on what you have there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:50.660
 two apples a bit cinnamon sugar 250 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 grams of sugar and a kilo of quark 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 First, you can butter in one 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 heat pot and a little bit again 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:07.049
 let cool down 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 First we need a baking pan 26 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:18.830
 centimeter course and this fat we 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.830
 just like that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.890
 in the meantime, you can do that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.890
 oven already at 150 degrees 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.539
 for me today is friday and saturday 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 always unable to bake cakes 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.460
 is this time on friday 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 because this cake already has four 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.689
 I would say to cool down for hours 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 best actually over night so he 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.330
 is really nice cold because then catches 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:59.520
 He starts again and becomes something 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.850
 makes it firmer in consistency so then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.470
 you continue mixing then we are the times 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.470
 dough and that comes first 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.730
 eur 2 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.500
 and 3 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.890
 and last but not least only at 4 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 We are leaving that completely beautiful 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 hit 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.410
 like my dear does not work 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.450
 I noticed the camera has gone out 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.850
 and I do not know where we are 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 are given 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.310
 actually everything comes in the bowl 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.739
 hein the lemon or half the lemon 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.860
 or lime it off 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.380
 the two cups of fine pudding 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.780
 powder just so pure without boiling 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.610
 that happens in the oven then mine 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.380
 Trinka apartment again by two 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.060
 Teaspoon baking powder and mix again 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.060
 the mother I do have to the conclusion 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.670
 the load was like that 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.660
 carefully 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.660
 enter 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.150
 gradually 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.150
 very good 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.830
 but it is very important that the butter 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.830
 not so hot anymore 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.980
 because otherwise it starts 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.980
 klocke 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.370
 and now we just need it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.370
 every day when the mold is done 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:40.640
 a little smear what I am now 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.910
 still do I take a 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.910
 bit scared 

00:04:53.799 --> 00:05:09.319
 but what is going on in Saxony that is it 

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.009
 is just in the evening a4 and the 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.739
 open beta 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.369
 so now i start to see the apples 

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:16.789
 how it works 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:18.979
 yes, I think that's you and it's doing 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.869
 I go fast and now I have 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:31.189
 just stick to the apples like that 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:34.029
 a little bit like quark or cheesecake 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.029
 Press mass 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.540
 So as I said there are many 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.120
 possibilities open 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.310
 you can do it with strawberries 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.840
 I think this cake is strawberries 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.720
 not so my favorite i thought 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.930
 It tastes great but as I said I have 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.930
 thought 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.520
 it just comes in now 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.470
 little sugar I think apple fits there 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.470
 super great are even too great 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.100
 just as you like as well as that and 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.720
 the whole thing simply in the oven 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.569
 for one hour 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.330
 you have to be the best I do not know 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:33.199
 it should be about yes so already and the 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.800
 Upper deck spatially golden brown gold money 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.110
 his 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.150
 but you see he does not rise to that 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.870
 The cake is so high that is whole 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.099
 normal 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.250
 so I show I was there again 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.340
 spokesman i'll show you the apple cake 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:53.330
 apple cheesecake when he is done and 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.160
 yes I am happy if you have this video 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.470
 If you maybe consider it 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.330
 do it yourself and try it yourself 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.919
 Of course about prescription suggestions 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.740
 I sometimes especially great me 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:11.810
 So much fun and he looks then 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:13.280
 after an hour of delicious as I said 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.060
 he really has to spend a lot of time now 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.580
 cooling down 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.370
 So 34 hours, so four hours 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.320
 at least I will let him first 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.669
 Cool outside and then if he does 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.669
 somewhat cold, I put in the 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:30.470
 fridge and enjoy that when 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:32.979
 her cold is so much fun and 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.979
 good hunger
