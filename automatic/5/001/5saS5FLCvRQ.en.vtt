00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.950 

and<00:01:37.730> then<00:01:37.850> take<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.210> whole<00:01:38.450> shape<00:01:38.750> that

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
and then take that whole shape that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.360 
and then take that whole shape that
you're<00:01:39.080> playing<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.470> move<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.710> two<00:01:39.860> frets<00:01:40.130> up
