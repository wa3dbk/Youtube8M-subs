Healy<00:01:34.630> had<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> CNN<00:01:35.350> show<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.130> know<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.400> was

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
Healy had a CNN show you know I was

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.150 
Healy had a CNN show you know I was
waiting<00:01:37.300> with<00:01:37.390> bated<00:01:37.780> breath<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.320> think<00:01:38.950> that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
waiting with bated breath I think that

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.830 
waiting with bated breath I think that
you<00:01:39.369> know<00:01:39.490> there's<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.150> certain<00:01:40.450> type<00:01:40.810> of

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you know there's a certain type of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.530 
you know there's a certain type of
following<00:01:41.530> for<00:01:42.010> CNN<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:42.760> don't<00:01:43.060> think<00:01:43.420> that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
following for CNN and I don't think that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.930 
following for CNN and I don't think that
they<00:01:43.690> were<00:01:43.750> quite<00:01:44.080> ready<00:01:44.740> for<00:01:45.040> what<00:01:45.550> deal<00:01:45.759> was

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
they were quite ready for what deal was

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.210
