00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.859 
time because there are a lot of things
to<00:01:37.619> choose<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:37.970> themer<00:01:38.970> displays<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.570> with

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to choose from themer displays them with

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
to choose from themer displays them with
nice<00:01:40.170> large<00:01:40.530> thumbnail<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.369> makes<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
nice large thumbnail so it makes it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.749 
nice large thumbnail so it makes it
easier<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> choose<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.110> ones<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.409> like

easier to choose which ones you like
upon<00:01:44.759> clicking<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.750> notice<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
upon clicking one you will notice a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
upon clicking one you will notice a
series<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> screenshots<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.790> swipe

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
series of screenshots you can swipe

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700 
series of screenshots you can swipe
through<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> neat<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
through what is neat about this is that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.160 
through what is neat about this is that
these<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.939> pages<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> home

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
these are actually the pages of the home

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.289 
these are actually the pages of the home
screen<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> exactly<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.149> ever

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
screen and this is exactly what ever

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.510 
screen and this is exactly what ever
look<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> install<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.430> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
look like if you install it I think this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
look like if you install it I think this
is<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> great<00:01:56.969> way<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.509> user<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.110> preview

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
is a great way for a user to preview

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.260 
is a great way for a user to preview
their<00:01:58.740> themes<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> almost<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
their themes because it is almost like a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
their themes because it is almost like a
simulation<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.200> home<00:02:01.350> screen<00:02:01.590> before

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
simulation of your home screen before

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.270 
simulation of your home screen before
you<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.719> being<00:02:03.930> said

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
you actually use it with that being said

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
you actually use it with that being said
every<00:02:05.280> theme<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.270> contains<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
every theme is different and contains a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
every theme is different and contains a
different<00:02:07.110> setup<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.619> stylized<00:02:08.129> widgets<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
different setup of stylized widgets so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.880 
different setup of stylized widgets so
it<00:02:08.879> really<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.200> user<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.649> apply

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it really is up to the user to apply

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.580 
it really is up to the user to apply
what<00:02:11.069> they

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
what they

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.260 
what they
so<00:02:12.590> once<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.830> find<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.100> theme<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.730> just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
so once you find a theme you like just

hit<00:02:14.390> apply<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.320> download<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.830> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
hit apply and it will download it and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.340 
hit apply and it will download it and
automatically<00:02:16.490> set<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.320> your

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
automatically set it up so you have your

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.960 
automatically set it up so you have your
theme<00:02:18.680> installed<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.550> looking<00:02:19.670> great

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
theme installed and it's looking great

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.730 
theme installed and it's looking great
but<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.660> where<00:02:20.810> themer<00:02:21.080> gets<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.470> little

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
but this is where themer gets a little

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.920 
but this is where themer gets a little
hard<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.010> work<00:02:22.160> with<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:23.240> these<00:02:23.420> themes<00:02:23.720> are

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
hard to work with see these themes are

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.930 
hard to work with see these themes are
set<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.770> way<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:24.950> icons<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.790> widgets

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
set up in a way where icons and widgets

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.030 
set up in a way where icons and widgets
are<00:02:26.270> meant<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.900> be<00:02:26.930> placing<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> location

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
are meant to be placing the location

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.800 
are meant to be placing the location
they<00:02:28.190> are<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.330> essentially

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
they are because that is essentially

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.900 
they are because that is essentially
what<00:02:29.840> these<00:02:30.290> things<00:02:30.320> are<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.460> why<00:02:31.610> once

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
what these things are that is why once

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.030 
what these things are that is why once
you<00:02:32.030> apply<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.300> theme<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.020> widgets<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.590> icons

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040

meant to be messed with another thing to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.810 
meant to be messed with another thing to
mention<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.320> that<00:02:48.860> changing<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.640> wallpaper

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
mention is that changing the wallpaper

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.670 
mention is that changing the wallpaper
can<00:02:50.240> also<00:02:50.360> kill<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> integrity<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> theme

can also kill the integrity of the theme

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680 
can also kill the integrity of the theme
because<00:02:52.010> each<00:02:52.280> themes<00:02:52.700> wallpapers<00:02:53.450> are

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
because each themes wallpapers are

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.600 
because each themes wallpapers are
designed<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.260> look<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:54.680> part<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.250> if

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
designed to look like it's part of it if

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.760 
designed to look like it's part of it if
