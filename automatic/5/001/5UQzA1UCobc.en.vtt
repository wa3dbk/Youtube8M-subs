00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.099
 so much desire for all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.460
 guys i'm always gz roxas always 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.650
 su magna and today I am here with another 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.480
 video this time on how to go up by 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
 level quickly on call of duty 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 black ops two more than anything else is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 various tips or excerpts let's say from da 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 video and to play at the time I do not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.050
 I'm at the very high level I 'm at mi 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
 looks like prestige level 50 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 about 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 but my account was completely 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.559
 reset due to a bug when I was at the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 second prestige that in the end I would be 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.809
 about the fifth prestige eg 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 but let's start immediately then the first one 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.449
 I advise you to choose the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 game modes you most prefer e 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 that guarantees you the most points possible in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840
 I was playing this domain game 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.689
 but I have to say that the one I play that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 often it is confirmed killing 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.510
 this is because a kill is worth 50 points 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.030
 and every confirmed chip is worth it 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 one hundred while each tile denied it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.409
 worth 25 as well as ensuring that the points 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 experience let's say a normal one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.200
 killing in most 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.869
 game mode then one hundred to the limit 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.299
 125 for example if we are on the flag 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.810
 allows you to call in my opinion the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.369
 series of points much faster 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 because al can do for example for 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.150
 regarding places 34 kills ne 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 two or three will suffice 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.640
 another advice I can give you is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 to alternate very much the all 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.740
 accessories and the specialties you have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.479
 in your class for this vi 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 I recommend using wild cards 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.250
 for example in most of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.219
 my classes I use two wild cards one 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.590
 to have a second specialty in one 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.229
 category and another to have three 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.440
 accessories on a weapon this brings various 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 advantages then use for example two 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 specialty allows you to complete 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.140
 at the same time the challenges are for the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.610
 first specialty than for the second 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.740
 let's take a phantom example e 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.440
 inflexible at the same time 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.320
 using the unlock the challenge for 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.230
 the wild card specialty avidity 1 e 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.330
 this will guarantee us other points instead 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.300
 as for the wild card of three 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.670
 accessories allows us to complete the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.470
 challenges for the titles of three accessories 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.810
 which guarantee if not wrong about 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 5000 points each plus that of the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 wild card 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.500
 and this can be really great 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.330
 way to gain experience on my own 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.530
 opinion other other tips we say for 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 level up are those of 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.360
 reuse and download 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.850
 the call of duty elite application either 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.470
 on the apple devices that android 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.300
 then this application in my opinion 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.070
 it is very useful because in addition to keeping 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 account of your recent matches 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.810
 allows to evaluate the percentage 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.360
 that remains to complete a challenge 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.799
 in fact one of the best ways to get serious 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.920
 level to complete precisely 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.380
 these challenges and having available to the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.940
 data that allow us to know which ones 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.100
 challenges are the next to be 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.810
 completed can be really useful 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.840
 these are some of the images 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.650
 coming from the application you want 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.450
 see on the screen another tip is 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.600
 that of using series 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.549
 specifications for example use low series 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.010
 as for example places that the 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.320
 jorge counterattack allows us to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.760
 get points easily and call him 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.070
 in fact indeed as well 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.780
 you will know are ten points for each assist 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.959
 but there are 10 points for each asset 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.790
 so a good counterattack 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.160
 technique could be use a 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 new and a wavi counterattack to do 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.019
 of general points and to help the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.360
 your team to win which is another 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.100
 very important factor then play 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.600
 for targets, take the plates 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.419
 catch the flags and say this 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.190
 could be a food could 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.109
 equal to a slight decrease of 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.210
 rat and dead killings but in the end it is not 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.640
 so important in black ops two are 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.930
 more important are defeated victories e 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.729
 with d 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.610
 and I was just talking about being from 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.620
 points like third we recommend a series 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.979
 of points instead able to procure 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.740
 killings such as a helicopter 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.039
 stealth that an attack is not too high 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.630
 lightning-fast or in extremis maybe if 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.970
 you don't need detail 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.639
 kills a peat fixer such that there is 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.190
 allows to get killings with 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.370
 really easy weapons 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.470
 in fact despite during the game 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.789
 we receive only 25 points for a 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.250
 killing for example with the helicopter 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.660
 stealth at the end of the game if you go to 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.479
 check in the report for a 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.789
 engraving will be worth 100 points then 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:12.699
 being able to use the last rick 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.380
 that increase their chances of 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.289
 killing and own points to 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.259
 same time as final a past that 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.940
 grant us many killings there 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.810
 really allows you to earn 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.810
 many points 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.669
 one last piece of advice I can give you 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.740
 although it is rather obvious and to look for 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.400
 to make more blows to the head with weapons 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.130
 possible 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.110
 I know it's a pretty hard thing to 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.419
 particularly if you do n't have a great deal 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.900
 connection that's why I haven't yet 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.810
 all weapons 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.580
 sorry but also the real ones 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.659
 they will compensate with new camouflage 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.229
 and obviously with as many points 2,500 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.630
 if I'm not mistaken up to the crypt here 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.180
 however we get up to 5,000 and then 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.479
 their 5000 and prestige went in over to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.070
 weapons that guarantee you more each time 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.990
 experience points though necessary 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.300
 unlocked we will come to unlock a 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.659
 total of 15,000 points just for having 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.900
 camouflage and loans completed 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.270
 then weapons of today's video 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.030
 finished thank you for following me 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.180
 up to here I thank guana for having me 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.699
 given this possibility and we'll see each other 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.310
 I leave you with the next video 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.270
 end of this gameplay and so much trouble e 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.270
 for everyone beautiful 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.330
 under master and blow struck in 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.560
 waiting for coordinates 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.460
 and I want the time of the mission 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.460
 possible nyt elena 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.810
 then we see
