gonna go over which types of lines
better<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:40.090> why<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.920> as<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.100> can<00:00:42.190> see<00:00:42.250> here

recommend<00:00:59.140> power<00:00:59.350> Pro<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.489> difference

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
recommend power Pro the difference

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.290 
recommend power Pro the difference
between<00:01:00.909> power<00:01:01.210> Pro<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.260> other<00:01:02.379> two<00:01:02.680> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
between power Pro and the other two is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.030 
between power Pro and the other two is
power<00:01:04.300> Pro<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.900> know<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.350> guys<00:01:05.560> I'm<00:01:05.800> sure<00:01:05.830> you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
power Pro I know you guys I'm sure you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.070 
power Pro I know you guys I'm sure you
can't<00:01:06.220> see<00:01:06.370> on<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.610> video<00:01:06.820> but<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.810> it's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
can't see on the video but it it's

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.160 
can't see on the video but it it's
rougher<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.890> doesn't<00:01:09.220> have<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.630> these<00:01:10.960> have

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
rougher it doesn't have this these have

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.230 
rougher it doesn't have this these have
like<00:01:11.320> slick<00:01:11.770> coatings<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.820> it's<00:01:13.030> like<00:01:13.210> a

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
like slick coatings on it it's like a

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.630 
like slick coatings on it it's like a
coating<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.780> makes<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.229> smoother<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.460> can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
coating that makes it smoother you can

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.290 
coating that makes it smoother you can
cast<00:01:15.909> smoother<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:18.100> makes<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> line<00:01:19.030> more

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
cast smoother and it makes the line more

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.830 
cast smoother and it makes the line more
durable<00:01:19.870> but<00:01:20.530> why<00:01:20.829> I<00:01:20.860> recommend<00:01:21.369> this<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:21.880> it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
durable but why I recommend this is it's

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.560 
durable but why I recommend this is it's
it's<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.530> lot<00:01:23.710> more<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.250> rugged<00:01:24.579> made<00:01:25.360> for

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
it's a lot more like rugged made for

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.380 
it's a lot more like rugged made for
throwing<00:01:25.810> in<00:01:25.960> moss<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.530> stuff<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
throwing in moss and stuff and it

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.060 
throwing in moss and stuff and it
because<00:01:29.110> when<00:01:29.290> you're<00:01:29.409> throwing<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.649> frog<00:01:29.890> your

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
because when you're throwing a frog your

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.530 
because when you're throwing a frog your
line<00:01:30.280> doesn't<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.729> torn<00:01:30.939> off<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.210> much<00:01:31.360> it's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
line doesn't get torn off that much it's

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.760 
line doesn't get torn off that much it's
not<00:01:31.630> under<00:01:31.899> water<00:01:32.079> it's<00:01:32.259> not<00:01:32.320> going<00:01:32.439> through

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
not under water it's not going through

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.550 
not under water it's not going through
brush<00:01:33.039> usually<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:34.299> hopping<00:01:34.659> along<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.200> so

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
brush usually just hopping along and so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.709 
brush usually just hopping along and so
this<00:01:36.130> stuff<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:37.060> stuff's<00:01:37.299> probably<00:01:37.630> your

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
this stuff this stuff's probably your

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.709 
this stuff this stuff's probably your
best<00:01:37.840> bet<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:39.060> stealth<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.299> power<00:01:40.509> Pro

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
best bet for that stealth and power Pro

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.380 
best bet for that stealth and power Pro
pretty<00:01:40.990> sure<00:01:41.110> kind<00:01:41.439> of<00:01:41.500> similar<00:01:41.920> price<00:01:42.390> fire

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
pretty sure kind of similar price fire

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.429 
pretty sure kind of similar price fire
line<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:44.170> little<00:01:44.409> more<00:01:44.680> expensive<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:47.079> I

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
line is a little more expensive and I

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.099 
line is a little more expensive and I
know<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:48.369> guys<00:01:48.490> probably<00:01:48.850> use<00:01:49.030> FX<00:01:49.509> sunlight

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
know you guys probably use FX sunlight

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.690 
know you guys probably use FX sunlight
and<00:01:50.350> I've<00:01:50.619> never<00:01:50.859> tried<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.369> know<00:01:51.430> it's

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
and I've never tried it I know it's

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.399 
and I've never tried it I know it's
probably<00:01:51.850> really<00:01:52.270> good<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:52.960> out<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.289> my

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
probably really good it's just out of my

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.050 
probably really good it's just out of my
budget<00:01:53.680> right<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.039> because<00:01:54.579> it's<00:01:54.969> really

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
budget right now because it's really

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.520 
budget right now because it's really
expensive<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.909> yeah<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.299> I'd<00:01:59.020> recommend

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
expensive and so yeah so I'd recommend

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.870 
expensive and so yeah so I'd recommend
if<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.679> only<00:01:59.829> have<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.009> frog<00:02:00.219> on<00:02:00.310> throw<00:02:00.609> power

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
if you only have a frog on throw power

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.380 
if you only have a frog on throw power
Pro<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.280> if<00:02:03.670> you're<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.060> doing<00:02:04.210> an

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
Pro if you if you're just doing an

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.209 
Pro if you if you're just doing an
all-around<00:02:05.049> rod<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.679> you<00:02:05.770> mean<00:02:06.070> you'll

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
all-around rod that you mean you'll

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.490 
all-around rod that you mean you'll
throw<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.880> frog<00:02:07.119> we<00:02:07.270> also<00:02:07.479> throw<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.869> jig<00:02:08.259> or

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
throw on the frog we also throw a jig or

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.450 
throw on the frog we also throw a jig or
something<00:02:09.130> like<00:02:09.220> that

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
something like that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.930 
something like that
I'd<00:02:09.880> recommend<00:02:10.179> these<00:02:10.479> two<00:02:10.720> kinds<00:02:11.670> fire<00:02:12.670> lines

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I'd recommend these two kinds fire lines

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.610 
I'd recommend these two kinds fire lines
a<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.210> bit<00:02:13.330> higher<00:02:13.600> quality<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
a little bit higher quality it's a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.010 
a little bit higher quality it's a
little<00:02:14.980> more<00:02:15.100> expensive<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.450> use<00:02:16.630> stealth

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
little more expensive and I use stealth

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.530 
little more expensive and I use stealth
on<00:02:17.230> almost<00:02:17.470> all<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.800> my<00:02:17.950> reels<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.270> little

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
on almost all of my reels it's a little

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.700 
on almost all of my reels it's a little
in<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:20.890> inexpensive<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:23.320> lasts

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
in it it's more inexpensive and it lasts

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.010 
in it it's more inexpensive and it lasts
about<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.010> same<00:02:24.220> that's<00:02:24.520> just

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
about the same that's just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.050 
about the same that's just
Cass<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> little<00:02:25.680> smoother<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.880> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
Cass a little smoother and it's just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.100 
Cass a little smoother and it's just
kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.570> little<00:02:27.660> bit<00:02:27.870> higher<00:02:28.080> quality

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
kind of it's a little bit higher quality

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.040 
kind of it's a little bit higher quality
than<00:02:29.330> fiber<00:02:30.330> than<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:30.990> spider<00:02:31.890> wire<00:02:32.190> but

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
than fiber than a spider wire but

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.340 
than fiber than a spider wire but
they're<00:02:34.050> pretty

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
they're pretty

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.980 
they're pretty
these<00:02:34.740> guys<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.040> pretty<00:02:35.250> similar<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
these guys are pretty similar like I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.840 
these guys are pretty similar like I
said<00:02:37.050> stealth<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> little<00:02:37.980> bit<00:02:38.070> cheaper<00:02:38.460> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
said stealth so a little bit cheaper and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.300 
said stealth so a little bit cheaper and
these<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.420> coated<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.890> reason<00:02:41.160> why

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
these are coated and so the reason why

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.550 
these are coated and so the reason why
they're<00:02:41.460> better<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.870> flippin<00:02:43.320> if<00:02:43.440> you're

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
they're better for the flippin if you're

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
they're better for the flippin if you're
if<00:02:43.740> you're<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.950> jig<00:02:44.190> fisherman<00:02:44.670> pick<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.510> either

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
if you're a jig fisherman pick up either

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.810 
if you're a jig fisherman pick up either
one<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> these<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.860> they're<00:02:47.550> come

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
one of these because they're come

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.640 
one of these because they're come
they're<00:02:48.240> covered<00:02:48.630> with<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.870> coat<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
they're covered with the coat the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.130 
they're covered with the coat the
special<00:02:50.040> coating<00:02:50.400> helps<00:02:51.330> protect<00:02:51.870> against

special coating helps protect against

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.710 
special coating helps protect against

abrasion resistance when you're when

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.850

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
you're pitching in to cover and you're

hitting true branches the smooth coating
over<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.660> protect<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.200> line<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.680> make

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
over this will protect the line and make

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.920 
over this will protect the line and make
it<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.040> flavor<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.450> line<00:03:03.720> will

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
it not flavor so this this line will

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.310 
it not flavor so this this line will
fray<00:03:04.170> much<00:03:04.470> faster<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.700> stealth<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.750> fire

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
fray much faster then stealth or fire

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.210 
fray much faster then stealth or fire
line<00:03:07.790> that's<00:03:08.790> why<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> say<00:03:09.420> use<00:03:09.710> power<00:03:10.710> Pro<00:03:11.040> on

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.710 
line that's why I say use power Pro on

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
and it's a little more string life so

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.490 
and it's a little more string life so
for<00:03:53.880> frog<00:03:54.120> fishing<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.630> recommend<00:03:54.960> Power<00:03:55.170> Pro
