00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 as always good first very well 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.050
 technical but you know that these things 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 I always get more and 755 good I think 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.550

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 doing this then I'm going fourth then 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.970
 obviously I do not know if it is that it is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 listening well and makes me move away 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.440
 little the micro because always the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340
 always continuously giving the blow of 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.060
 command so it was not a question will and that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.410
 was this definitely never play 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.380
 I'm always hitting the knob I do not know 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:35.759
 if it is higher 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 we are maintaining the fourth position 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.560
 that is not bad, although good is less than 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560
