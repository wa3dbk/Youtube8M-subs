you so check this out it's aluminum

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
you so check this out it's aluminum
alright<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.239> aluminum<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> ah<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:39.780> we

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
alright that is aluminum but ah then we

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.150 
alright that is aluminum but ah then we
flip<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
flip it over here and you can see that
is<00:00:44.160> plastic<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.239> exactly<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> same

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is plastic that's exactly the same

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.970 
is plastic that's exactly the same
plastic<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.670> old<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.710> here's<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> old

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
plastic as the old one here's the old

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.000 
plastic as the old one here's the old
one<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.879> move<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.420> over<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> way

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
one let's move them over to the way

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
one let's move them over to the way
there's<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> old<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> new<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.719> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there's the old there's a new can you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
there's the old there's a new can you
tell<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> difference<00:00:55.219> switch<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.370> around

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
tell the difference switch them around

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
tell the difference switch them around
can<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> tell<00:00:57.239> which<00:00:57.510> ones<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:59.250> have

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609

can you tell which ones which you have
no<00:01:00.090> idea<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.530> why

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
no idea which one is which you know why

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.750 
no idea which one is which you know why
because<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.090> bottom<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> exactly<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> same

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
because that bottom is exactly the same

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.560 
because that bottom is exactly the same
plastic<00:01:05.960> aluminum<00:01:07.159> they<00:01:08.159> changed<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> top

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
plastic aluminum they changed that top

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.300 
plastic aluminum they changed that top
little<00:01:09.990> section<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.659> he<00:01:13.020> did

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
little section there that's all he did

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.410 
little section there that's all he did
you<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.670> that's<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.900> plastic<00:01:17.420> that's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you look at that's all plastic that's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.219 
you look at that's all plastic that's
all<00:01:18.630> plastic<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:21.060> chip<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> higher

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
all plastic this chip here the higher

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.850 
all plastic this chip here the higher
resolution<00:01:22.799> chip<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.780> definitely<00:01:25.500> does

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
resolution chip that definitely does

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
resolution chip that definitely does
look<00:01:26.040> different<00:01:26.720> than<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.350> old<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> they

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
look different than the old one so they

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.800 
look different than the old one so they
also<00:01:33.570> made<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.860> faders<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.540> knobs

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
also made all the faders are and knobs

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.190 
also made all the faders are and knobs
are<00:01:37.079> thinner<00:01:37.759> pop<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.110> going

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
are thinner pop one off and you're going

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.370 
are thinner pop one off and you're going
to<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.520> difference<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.990> why

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to see the difference they did that why

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
to see the difference they did that why
do<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.799> did<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> save<00:01:44.490> some

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
do you think they did that save some

do you think they did that save some
money<00:01:45.829> right<00:01:47.750> one<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> other<00:01:48.990> things<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
money right one of the other things I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
money right one of the other things I
did<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:50.220> change<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.850> way<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.180> print<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
did they change the way this print is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.499 
did they change the way this print is
that<00:01:51.869> print<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.500> underneath<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:54.240> top

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that print is now underneath the top

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
that print is now underneath the top
finish<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.619> won't<00:01:55.860> wear<00:01:56.009> off<00:01:57.590> mine<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> never

is the work controller and it's been

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
is the work controller and it's been
used<00:02:04.829> quite<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> bit<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.030> like
