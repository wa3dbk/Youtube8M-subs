with one orange clip and six starts so I
brought<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.190> rate<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.430> drum<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.790> see<00:02:31.970> what

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
brought up the rate of drum to see what

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.590 
brought up the rate of drum to see what
that<00:02:32.810> looks<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.200> in

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
back well wouldn't work on that side try

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.490 
back well wouldn't work on that side try
this<00:03:02.040> other<00:03:02.340> side<00:03:05.480> no<00:03:06.480> goes<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.140> backwards

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
this other side no goes and backwards

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.830

everybody knows how to do this from all
shots<00:04:48.520> also<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.000> prime<00:04:50.270> indicator<00:04:51.280> is

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
shots also the the prime indicator is

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.390 
shots also the the prime indicator is
right<00:04:52.610> there<00:04:52.850> it's<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.600> slit<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.400> when

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
right there it's that slit and when

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.720 
right there it's that slit and when
that's<00:04:55.900> when<00:04:56.900> it's<00:04:57.050> not<00:04:57.230> primed<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:58.310> slit<00:04:58.700> is

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
that's when it's not primed that slit is

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.450 
that's when it's not primed that slit is
black<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.360> that<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.410> simply<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:01.010> reverse
