 nerve and sadness is a tear to the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.610
 principle the girl's emotions were going 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.650
 to be many reaching up to 27 that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.500
 they included surprise pride and confidence 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.540
 but the writers quickly noticed 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 that there were too many characters and a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.620
 small viewer could reach 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.100
 so confused that reduced 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.230
 5 although surely they saw everywhere 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
 that the director of the film is pete docter 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.000
 we emphasize that he is not the only one behind 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.310
 of the movie since docter co-directed 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.050
 with romney del carmen who was also 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.570
 part of the creation of the story 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.910
 prior to the execution of the script 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.100
 unlike other characters 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.350
 animated children's movies the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 team of designers suffered a lot 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.640
 with the emotions since they were not 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.160
 concrete beings the idea was that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.080
 were full of energy then 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.170
 you had to represent that materiality 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.050
 on the big screen talking about the team 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.410
 of designers behind this film were 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.210
 literally 45 animators less than the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.000
 half of a standard equipment for 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.210
 pixar projects rightly cost them 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.490
 both the story is very innovative and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.680
 possibly crossed his mind to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.320
 more than one especially when it is 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.810
 adolescent adopt happened the same 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.000
 but when his daughter was going through 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.400
 that process so as a parent I look for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530
 understand it and there he had the idea of 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.360
 represent a developing mind with 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.360
 many 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.760
