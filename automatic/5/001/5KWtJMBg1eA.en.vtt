our California dates I have three of
them<00:02:04.749> here<00:02:04.959> and<00:02:06.060> they're<00:02:07.060> fantastic<00:02:07.240> for

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
them here and they're fantastic for

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.339 
them here and they're fantastic for
adding<00:02:08.229> sweetness

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
adding sweetness

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.670 
adding sweetness
and<00:02:09.469> this<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:09.829> they<00:02:10.009> look<00:02:10.159> like<00:02:10.429> Biman<00:02:11.420> bulk

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and this is they look like Biman bulk

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.119 
and this is they look like Biman bulk
they<00:02:12.680> last<00:02:13.189> for<00:02:13.549> months<00:02:13.939> on<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.180> shelf<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:15.129> also

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
they last for months on the shelf I also

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.330 
they last for months on the shelf I also
buy<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.459> almonds<00:02:16.909> in<00:02:16.999> bulk<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.129> storm<00:02:19.129> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
buy the almonds in bulk and storm and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.789 
buy the almonds in bulk and storm and
half-gallon<00:02:19.670> mason<00:02:19.849> jars<00:02:20.389> so<00:02:21.319> that's<00:02:21.499> it<00:02:21.650> I

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
half-gallon mason jars so that's it I

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.440 
half-gallon mason jars so that's it I
throw<00:02:21.980> them<00:02:22.099> all<00:02:22.219> in<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> blender<00:02:22.700> here<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
throw them all in the blender here and I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.030 
throw them all in the blender here and I
start<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.959> most<00:02:24.139> 5<00:02:24.349> worst<00:02:24.590> ones<00:02:24.799> first

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
start with the most 5 worst ones first

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.830 
start with the most 5 worst ones first
like<00:02:25.249> the<00:02:25.340> carrots<00:02:25.700> I'll<00:02:26.090> chuck<00:02:26.450> those<00:02:26.659> in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
like the carrots I'll chuck those in

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.649 
like the carrots I'll chuck those in
there<00:02:26.959> first<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.000> they're<00:02:29.450> closer

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
there first so that the they're closer

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.990 
there first so that the they're closer
to<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.900> blades<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.099> I'll<00:02:31.219> throw<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.579> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
to the blades and then I'll throw in the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.089 
to the blades and then I'll throw in the
broccoli<00:02:32.359> and<00:02:33.760> probably<00:02:34.760> almonds<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.799> just

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
broccoli and probably almonds and just

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.619 
broccoli and probably almonds and just
proceed<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.609> go<00:02:37.700> ahead<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.969> dump<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.329> this<00:02:38.450> in

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
proceed to go ahead and dump all this in

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.050 
proceed to go ahead and dump all this in
there<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.069> we'll<00:02:40.069> blend<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.519> here<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:40.909> is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
there and we'll blend it up here it is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.990 
there and we'll blend it up here it is
all<00:02:41.239> ready<00:02:41.389> to<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:41.689> it's<00:02:42.049> filled<00:02:42.319> up<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:43.790> gonna

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
all ready to go it's filled up I'm gonna

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.610 
all ready to go it's filled up I'm gonna
blend<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.359> on<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.780> highest<00:02:45.139> setting

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
blend this on the highest setting

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.170 
blend this on the highest setting
probably<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.219> three<00:02:46.430> or<00:02:46.579> four<00:02:46.609> minutes<00:02:47.000> to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
probably for three or four minutes to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.939 
probably for three or four minutes to
really<00:02:47.359> break<00:02:47.569> down<00:02:47.629> especially<00:02:48.139> that<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:48.949 
really break down especially that the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.990 
really break down especially that the
kale<00:02:49.159> leaves<00:02:49.400> they<00:02:49.669> tend<00:02:49.909> to<00:02:51.579> they<00:02:52.579> tend<00:02:52.790> to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
kale leaves they tend to they tend to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.349 
kale leaves they tend to they tend to
take<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.629> lot<00:02:53.719> more<00:02:53.989> processing<00:02:54.939> so<00:02:55.939> here<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.209> go

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
take a lot more processing so here we go

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.119 
take a lot more processing so here we go
it's<00:02:56.689> all<00:02:56.780> finished<00:02:56.989> blended<00:02:57.769> together<00:02:57.889> a

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
it's all finished blended together a

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.629 
it's all finished blended together a
nice<00:02:58.430> creamy<00:02:58.879> consistency<00:03:00.370> they<00:03:01.370> got<00:03:01.519> to

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
nice creamy consistency they got to

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.520 
nice creamy consistency they got to

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.550 
problem
you<00:03:37.759> may<00:03:37.879> notice<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.689> tends<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.049> thicken<00:03:39.439> up

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
you may notice it it tends to thicken up

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.740 
you may notice it it tends to thicken up
in<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.189> refrigerator<00:03:40.729> so<00:03:41.060> just<00:03:41.389> add<00:03:41.569> some

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
in the refrigerator so just add some

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.439 
in the refrigerator so just add some
water<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.169> stir<00:03:42.379> it<00:03:42.439> in<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.909> get<00:03:43.909> back<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.359> that

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
water and stir it in to get back to that

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.409 
water and stir it in to get back to that
consistency<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.259> want<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:46.060> I'm<00:03:47.060> thinking

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
consistency you want and I'm thinking

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.149 
consistency you want and I'm thinking
you<00:03:47.479> can<00:03:47.599> even<00:03:47.720> probably<00:03:48.290> freeze<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.829> in<00:03:49.009> the

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
you can even probably freeze this in the

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.819 
you can even probably freeze this in the
pint<00:03:49.879> jars<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.479> haven't<00:03:51.229> tried<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.530> yet<00:03:51.650> but

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
pint jars I haven't tried it yet but

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.949 
pint jars I haven't tried it yet but
it's<00:03:51.919> on<00:03:52.040> my<00:03:52.069> list<00:03:52.219> of<00:03:52.519> things<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.759> do<00:03:52.939> so<00:03:53.810> there

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
it's on my list of things to do so there

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.780 
it's on my list of things to do so there
you<00:03:54.019> have<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.319> that's<00:03:54.439> how<00:03:54.979> you<00:03:55.489> make<00:03:55.639> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
you have it that's how you make and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.059 
you have it that's how you make and
store<00:03:55.969> juice<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.629> I'm<00:03:57.319> still<00:03:57.620> losing<00:03:57.769> weight

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
store juice and I'm still losing weight

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.159 
store juice and I'm still losing weight
and<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.849> will<00:03:58.879> too<00:03:59.150> if<00:03:59.299> you<00:03:59.419> drink<00:03:59.840> enough<00:03:59.930> of
