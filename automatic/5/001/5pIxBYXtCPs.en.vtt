00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
one more than any other game that we

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
one more than any other game that we
recall<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> time<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.719> gave<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> way

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
recall at the time really gave you a way

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
recall at the time really gave you a way
to<00:01:01.379> mitigate<00:01:01.770> luck<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> draw<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to mitigate luck of the draw which is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
to mitigate luck of the draw which is
the<00:01:03.690> reason<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.170> stopped<00:01:04.439> playing<00:01:04.619> CCGs<00:01:05.570> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the reason we stopped playing CCGs you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
the reason we stopped playing CCGs you
know<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.140> what<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> call<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I'm no mana hosed in in magic where you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.550 
I'm no mana hosed in in magic where you
just<00:01:10.590> draw<00:01:10.830> no<00:01:11.700> lands<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.780> another<00:01:13.229> turn<00:01:13.409> no

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just draw no lands for another turn no

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
just draw no lands for another turn no
lands<00:01:13.830> no<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.189> no<00:01:14.280> lands<00:01:14.490> yeah<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
lands no that's right no lands yeah and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.219 
lands no that's right no lands yeah and
you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.119> Mulligan's<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.020> if

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you can have Mulligan's but you know if

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.420 
you can have Mulligan's but you know if
there's<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.680> nothing<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.280> about

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there's just nothing you can do about

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.080 
there's just nothing you can do about
luck<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> draw

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
luck of the draw

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
luck of the draw
you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.409> everything<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you know because everything kind of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
you know because everything kind of
based<00:01:20.310> itself<00:01:20.640> off<00:01:20.820> magic<00:01:21.210> gather<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
based itself off magic gather and this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
based itself off magic gather and this
did<00:01:22.170> too<00:01:22.549> but<00:01:23.549> again<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.360> more

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
did too but again we like this one more

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.609 
did too but again we like this one more
than<00:01:24.659> any<00:01:24.689> others<00:01:24.990> both<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
than any others both because of the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
than any others both because of the
brilliant<00:01:26.340> asymmetry<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> how<00:01:27.090> each<00:01:27.270> player

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
brilliant asymmetry and how each player

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.789 
brilliant asymmetry and how each player
is<00:01:27.630> playing<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.110> different<00:01:28.409> game<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.560> yet

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is playing a very different game and yet

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
is playing a very different game and yet
it's<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.070> balanced<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's very balanced and because in this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
it's very balanced and because in this
game<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:31.860> actions<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> have

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
game you could take actions if you have

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.620 
game you could take actions if you have
bad<00:01:32.700> draw<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.210> keep<00:01:33.360> drawing<00:01:33.509> cards

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bad draw let's just keep drawing cards

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
bad draw let's just keep drawing cards
until<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.229> good<00:01:34.380> ones<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.549> least<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
until you get good ones so at least it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
until you get good ones so at least it
was<00:01:36.360> better<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> other<00:01:36.960> ones<00:01:37.140> but

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
was better than the other ones but

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
was better than the other ones but
eventually<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.250> did<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.549> stop<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.060> stop

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
eventually we did still stop it and stop

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
eventually we did still stop it and stop
playing<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.950> storage<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
playing and put it all in in storage I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.440 
playing and put it all in in storage I
wonder<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> should<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.939> those<00:01:42.060> cards<00:01:42.299> out

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
wonder if I should get those cards out

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.490 
wonder if I should get those cards out
and<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:43.200> worth<00:01:43.380> anything

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and see if they're worth anything

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.960 
and see if they're worth anything
because<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:45.899> stop<00:01:46.140> playing<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> runner

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
because we did stop playing that runner

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.190 
because we did stop playing that runner
because<00:01:47.970> even<00:01:48.479> though<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.659> mitigates<00:01:48.960> luck

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
because even though this mitigates luck

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.510 
because even though this mitigates luck
of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> draw<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> doesn't<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.009> rid<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
of the draw it doesn't get rid of it and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.999 
of the draw it doesn't get rid of it and
