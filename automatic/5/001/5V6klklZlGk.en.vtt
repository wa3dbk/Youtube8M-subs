 perfections is to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 goes to put the topic because of the traction 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.399
 which is made of metal 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.020
 it is much stronger than a rope masturbation 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.170
 often enough to tear well how often in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 depending on the operation of the motorcycle but 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.219

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.979
 rubles in height in length that is about 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.240
