00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.680 
now it's just a shame the League of won
this<00:05:15.860> year<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.669> has<00:05:16.880> died<00:05:17.090> off<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.300> little<00:05:17.479> bit

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
this year and has died off a little bit

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.110 
this year and has died off a little bit
mainly<00:05:17.900> because<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.620> people<00:05:19.610> leaving

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
mainly because of the people leaving

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.200 
mainly because of the people leaving
like<00:05:20.270> hammers<00:05:20.570> Rodriguez<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.550> Falcao<00:05:22.550> it

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
like hammers Rodriguez and Falcao it

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.480 
like hammers Rodriguez and Falcao it
does<00:05:23.419> bring<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.930> value<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:24.650> obviously<00:05:25.340> the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
does bring the value and obviously the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.740 
does bring the value and obviously the
plane<00:05:25.669> timing<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.120> spend<00:05:26.360> will<00:05:26.449> league<00:05:26.570> on

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
plane timing to spend will league on

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.020 
plane timing to spend will league on
teams<00:05:26.990> down<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:27.710> hopefully<00:05:28.070> that<00:05:28.430> changes

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
teams down but hopefully that changes

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.390 
teams down but hopefully that changes
maybe<00:05:29.270> it<00:05:29.690> might<00:05:29.930> be<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.340> hopefully<00:05:31.340> I'm

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
maybe it might be the hopefully I'm

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.520 
maybe it might be the hopefully I'm
hoping<00:05:32.210> he<00:05:32.360> changes<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.900> BPL<00:05:33.229> for<00:05:33.440> his
