so you can use the jailbreakme com

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.170 
so you can use the jailbreakme com
forever<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.040> roll<00:00:32.610> back<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.090> the

it's going to process glass cydia for
your<00:02:32.220> SHSH<00:02:32.700> blobs<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:38.599> then<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.230> also

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
your SHSH blobs and then you can also

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.559 
your SHSH blobs and then you can also
use<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.709> tilt<00:02:41.010> utility<00:02:41.579> if<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.060> use<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.540> to

save<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.079> SHSH<00:02:43.709> file<00:02:44.189> you<00:02:44.879> can<00:02:45.030> click<00:02:45.299> start

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
save your SHSH file you can click start

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.979 
save your SHSH file you can click start
tss<00:02:46.500> server<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.879> that'll<00:02:48.359> make<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.720> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
tss server and then that'll make it so

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.069 
tss server and then that'll make it so
that<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:49.590> instead<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.549> using<00:02:51.079> apple's

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
that you can instead of using apple's

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.069 
that you can instead of using apple's
servers<00:02:52.439> to<00:02:53.069> verify<00:02:53.549> your<00:02:53.700> firmware<00:02:54.000> file<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
servers to verify your firmware file it

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.750 
servers to verify your firmware file it
will<00:02:55.319> use<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:56.689> the<00:02:57.689> tss<00:02:58.140> server<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.400> verify

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
will use this the tss server to verify

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.490 
will use this the tss server to verify
your<00:02:59.790> firmware<00:03:00.090> file<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.319> can

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
your firmware file and then you can

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.319 
your firmware file and then you can
downgrade<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.909> need<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:04.909> ok<00:03:05.909> there<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.209> go

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
downgrade if you need to ok there we go

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.369 
downgrade if you need to ok there we go
it<00:03:06.840> says<00:03:08.329> your<00:03:09.329> ssh<00:03:10.069> has<00:03:11.069> been<00:03:11.400> saved<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
it says your ssh has been saved and

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.960 
it says your ssh has been saved and
that's<00:03:13.379> all<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:13.920> backup<00:03:14.370> your<00:03:14.400> SHSH

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that's all you do to backup your SHSH

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.030 
that's all you do to backup your SHSH
blobs<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.930> can<00:03:16.170> downgrade<00:03:16.409> your<00:03:16.769> firmware

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
blobs so you can downgrade your firmware

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.420 
blobs so you can downgrade your firmware
