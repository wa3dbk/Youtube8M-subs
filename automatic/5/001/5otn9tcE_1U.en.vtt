00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
doing it's been about a month since my

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.120 
doing it's been about a month since my
surgery<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.620> think<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> doctor<00:00:08.010> got

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
surgery and I think the doctor got

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.580 
surgery and I think the doctor got
really<00:00:08.370> great<00:00:08.670> results<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:10.050> still<00:00:10.380> kind<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
really great results I can still kind of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.890 
really great results I can still kind of
tell<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:10.800> they're<00:00:11.130> not<00:00:11.160> exactly<00:00:11.969> perfect<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
tell that they're not exactly perfect I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.600 
tell that they're not exactly perfect I
do<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.559> another<00:00:13.860> appointment<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> few

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
do have another appointment in a few

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
do have another appointment in a few
weeks<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.900> talk<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
weeks and we're going to talk about the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
weeks and we're going to talk about the
possibility<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.940> second

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
possibility of going in for a second

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
possibility of going in for a second
surgery<00:00:19.340> he<00:00:20.340> fixed<00:00:20.910> them<00:00:21.920> horizontally<00:00:22.920> but

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
surgery he fixed them horizontally but

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
surgery he fixed them horizontally but
there's<00:00:23.250> still<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> vertical<00:00:23.939> element<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.660> he

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
there's still a vertical element that he

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
there's still a vertical element that he
wasn't<00:00:25.350> able<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.880> surgery<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
wasn't able to do all in one surgery I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.570 
wasn't able to do all in one surgery I
guess<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> only<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.230> two<00:00:28.980> muscles<00:00:29.369> at<00:00:29.460> one

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
guess you can only do two muscles at one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.620 
guess you can only do two muscles at one
time<00:00:29.869> safely<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.250> may<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:33.030> may<00:00:33.600> not

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
time safely so may going again may not

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.270 
time safely so may going again may not
depending<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.500> says

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
depending on what he says

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
depending on what he says
I'm<00:00:35.670> certainly<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.360> happy<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.110> things

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I'm certainly very happy with how things

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.139 
I'm certainly very happy with how things
turned<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.879> really

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
turned out I don't think you can really

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
turned out I don't think you can really
tell<00:00:39.329> unless<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.920> stare<00:00:41.430> at

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
tell unless you really really stare at

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
tell unless you really really stare at
me<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.780> they're<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.050> perfect<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
me that they're not perfect but like I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
me that they're not perfect but like I
said<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.180> happy<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.660> his<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> he

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
said I'm very happy with his work and he

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.080 
said I'm very happy with his work and he
got<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.160> closer<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> thought<00:00:47.789> he

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
got it a lot closer than I thought he

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.260 
got it a lot closer than I thought he
even<00:00:48.329> could<00:00:49.309> redness<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> swelling<00:00:50.640> has<00:00:51.239> gone

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
even could redness and swelling has gone

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.410 
even could redness and swelling has gone

scratchiness and it doesn't feel any
different<00:01:05.220> than<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.450> usually<00:01:06.600> does

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
different than it usually does

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.399 
different than it usually does
I<00:01:07.369> did<00:01:08.369> notice<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.330> more

I did notice I have a lot more

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
I did notice I have a lot more
peripherally<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.159> over<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
peripherally going on over here then I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
peripherally going on over here then I
knew<00:01:12.570> existed<00:01:12.840> before<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.390> notice<00:01:15.390> cars<00:01:16.020> coming

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
knew existed before I notice cars coming

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
knew existed before I notice cars coming
at<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.790> driving<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.420> when

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
at me now when I'm driving or when

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
at me now when I'm driving or when
you're<00:01:18.840> walking<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> street<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> know

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you're walking down the street you know

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.740 
you're walking down the street you know
mailboxes<00:01:21.210> seem<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.740> fly<00:01:22.740> right<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
mailboxes seem to fly right by you and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.090 
mailboxes seem to fly right by you and
that's<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> definitely

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that's something that I definitely

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
that's something that I definitely
didn't<00:01:26.340> pick<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.729> before<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.890> there's<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
didn't pick up on before so there's a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
didn't pick up on before so there's a
whole<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.689> over<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.140> which

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
whole lot more going on over here which

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.760 
whole lot more going on over here which
is<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.740> neat<00:01:32.659> 3d<00:01:33.659> vision<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
is really neat 3d vision you know I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880 
is really neat 3d vision you know I
don't<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.729> I'll<00:01:35.850> ever<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.420> um<00:01:36.890> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
don't know if I'll ever get that um the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.940 
don't know if I'll ever get that um the
only<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.680> went<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
only way I really might is if we went in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
only way I really might is if we went in
for<00:01:40.979> another<00:01:41.220> surgery<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
for another surgery and this was a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
for another surgery and this was a
hundred<00:01:43.470> percent<00:01:43.500> exactly<00:01:44.040> aligned<00:01:44.729> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hundred percent exactly aligned like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
hundred percent exactly aligned like
this<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:47.189> there's<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this one is and then there's the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
this one is and then there's the
