the<00:00:17.400> pecs<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.940> muscles<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.539> are

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the pecs are muscles that are

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.359 
the pecs are muscles that are
chronically<00:00:19.260> shortened<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:19.980> people

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
chronically shortened with people

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.640 
chronically shortened with people
everything<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.689> our<00:00:21.840> arms<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.380> front

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
everything we do our arms are in front

everything we do our arms are in front
of<00:00:22.769> us<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.760> muscles<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.449> very<00:00:24.689> short

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of us so these muscles get very short

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.380 
of us so these muscles get very short
and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> shoulders<00:00:25.890> pull<00:00:26.160> forward<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.240> what

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and the shoulders pull forward so what

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.670 
and the shoulders pull forward so what

involved unless you want to for a
different<00:02:04.640> kind<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:04.940> effect<00:02:05.360> there<00:02:05.600> are<00:02:05.630> some

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
different kind of effect there are some

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.950 
different kind of effect there are some
people<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.590> like<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.160> engage<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:08.270> neck<00:02:08.509> but

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
people that like to engage the neck but

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.690 
people that like to engage the neck but
for<00:02:09.110> our<00:02:09.259> purposes<00:02:09.800> we're<00:02:10.130> going<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.369> keep<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
for our purposes we're going to keep it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.020 
for our purposes we're going to keep it
nice<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.030> neutral<00:02:11.810> very<00:02:12.170> relaxed<00:02:13.160> neck

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.250 

feeling<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.090> nice<00:02:17.270> wave<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> spine

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
feeling a nice wave in the spine

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.460 
feeling a nice wave in the spine
excellent

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
excellent

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.710 
excellent
so<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.220> modification<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.270> some<00:02:23.450> people

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
so one modification and some people

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.199 
so one modification and some people
refer<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.320> as<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.530> body<00:02:24.860> roll<00:02:25.130> instead<00:02:26.090> of

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
refer to this as a body roll instead of

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.080 
refer to this as a body roll instead of
feeling<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.690> only<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.260> upper<00:02:27.470> body<00:02:28.090> we're

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
feeling it only in the upper body we're

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.640 
feeling it only in the upper body we're
actually<00:02:29.240> going<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.630> engage<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.200> pelvis<00:02:30.620> a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
actually going to engage the pelvis a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.130 
actually going to engage the pelvis a
little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.250> makes<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.180> movement<00:02:32.360> larger<00:02:32.959> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
little bit makes the movement larger and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.140 
little bit makes the movement larger and
richer<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.190> what<00:02:34.340> I'm<00:02:34.459> now<00:02:34.640> going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:35.000> do<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
richer so what I'm now going to do is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.170 
richer so what I'm now going to do is
start<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.720> bent<00:02:35.930> knee<00:02:36.230> come<00:02:37.100> forward<00:02:37.910> up

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
start with a bent knee come forward up

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.740 
start with a bent knee come forward up
back<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:39.800> legs<00:02:40.070> have<00:02:40.310> straightened<00:02:40.700> as<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
back here my legs have straightened as I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.530 
back here my legs have straightened as I
contract<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.890> knees<00:02:43.190> bend<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.150> pull<00:02:44.390> me

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
contract the knees bend to pull me

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.020 
contract the knees bend to pull me
forward<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.740> I'm<00:02:45.890> sort<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.250> pushing<00:02:46.820> off<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
forward so I'm sort of pushing off the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.740 
forward so I'm sort of pushing off the
knees<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:48.709> have<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> forward<00:02:49.430> body<00:02:49.670> roll<00:02:49.970> arms

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
knees to have a forward body roll arms

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.400 
knees to have a forward body roll arms
can<00:02:50.989> be<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.290> by<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.650> sides<00:02:52.630> out<00:02:53.630> up

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
can be down by your sides out up

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.090 
can be down by your sides out up
overhead<00:02:57.040> possibilities<00:02:58.040> are<00:02:58.190> endless<00:03:00.100> up

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
overhead possibilities are endless up

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.920 
overhead possibilities are endless up
back

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.000 

good<00:03:05.560> now<00:03:06.189> the<00:03:06.250> reverse<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.420> movement

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
good now the reverse of this movement

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.949 
good now the reverse of this movement
starts<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.219> bent<00:03:09.489> knee<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:10.000> tuck<00:03:10.689> in<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
starts with a bent knee a tuck in the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.660 
starts with a bent knee a tuck in the
pelvis<00:03:11.379> I'm<00:03:11.530> engaging<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.219> low<00:03:12.400> belly

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
pelvis I'm engaging the low belly

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.399 
pelvis I'm engaging the low belly
pushing<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.299> belly<00:03:13.480> button<00:03:13.689> straight<00:03:14.230> back

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
pushing the belly button straight back

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.009 
pushing the belly button straight back
to<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.650> spine<00:03:15.090> rolling<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.569> hip<00:03:16.750> bones

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
to the spine rolling the hip bones

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.670 
to the spine rolling the hip bones
forward<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.640> chest<00:03:18.939> follows<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.379> it's<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
forward and the chest follows so it's a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.280 
forward and the chest follows so it's a
sit<00:03:21.010> tuck<00:03:22.530> roll<00:03:23.530> up<00:03:24.299> sit<00:03:25.299> tuck<00:03:26.010> roll<00:03:27.010> up<00:03:28.290> last

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
sit tuck roll up sit tuck roll up last

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.079 
sit tuck roll up sit tuck roll up last
one<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:31.239> that's<00:03:31.359> your<00:03:31.629> undulation
