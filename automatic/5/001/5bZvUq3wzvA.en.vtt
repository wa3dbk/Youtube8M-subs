00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
talk about the new lazy man what is it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490 
talk about the new lazy man what is it
it's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.279> scorpion<00:00:17.789> GBC<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> first

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it's a scorpion GBC this is the first

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.220 
it's a scorpion GBC this is the first

blue laser diode and green laser diode

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.750 
blue laser diode and green laser diode
wait<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.500> said<00:00:25.680> blue<00:00:25.890> laser<00:00:26.130> diode<00:00:26.550> that's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
wait you said blue laser diode that's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.550 
wait you said blue laser diode that's
right<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> said<00:00:27.060> blue<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.110> first<00:00:28.350> in<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
right I said blue the first in the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
right I said blue the first in the
industry<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.070> include<00:00:29.310> fabian<00:00:29.760> technology<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
industry to include fabian technology a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
industry to include fabian technology a
blue<00:00:30.990> laser<00:00:31.199> diode<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.039> will<00:00:32.189> also<00:00:32.550> color

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
blue laser diode that will also color

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200 
blue laser diode that will also color
mix<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> green<00:00:33.539> to<00:00:33.809> create<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> cyan<00:00:35.210> so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
mix with the green to create a cyan so

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
mix with the green to create a cyan so
what<00:00:36.329> type<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.510> effective<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.199> it<00:00:37.379> that

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
what type of effective is it that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.049 
what type of effective is it that
sparkly<00:00:38.069> effect<00:00:38.159> or<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.609> it<00:00:38.699> more<00:00:38.819> patterns

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
sparkly effect or is it more patterns

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.939 
sparkly effect or is it more patterns
this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.769> than<00:00:40.859> the

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
this is a little bit different than the

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.410 
this is a little bit different than the
storm<00:00:41.190> series<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:41.699> create<00:00:41.999> the<00:00:42.059> dots<00:00:42.239> all

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
storm series which create the dots all

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.689 
storm series which create the dots all
over<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.690> place<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.499> is<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.949> an<00:00:44.309> aerial

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
over the place this is more of an aerial

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.099 
over the place this is more of an aerial
effect<00:00:44.999> when<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.359> fog<00:00:45.569> or<00:00:45.749> haze<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
effect when you have fog or haze in the

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.709 
effect when you have fog or haze in the
room<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.949> tons<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.460> patterns<00:00:47.879> built<00:00:48.210> into

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
room there's tons of patterns built into

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
room there's tons of patterns built into
the<00:00:48.839> laser<00:00:49.019> itself<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.679> basically<00:00:50.399> what

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the laser itself and basically what

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.919 
the laser itself and basically what
you're<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.819> to<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.089> trigger<00:00:51.359> any<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
you're going to do is trigger any of

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.540 
you're going to do is trigger any of
those<00:00:52.019> patterns<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.889> and<00:00:53.100> then

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
those patterns that you like and then

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.129 
those patterns that you like and then
using<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.059> channels<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> MX<00:00:54.929> you

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:55.139 
using the other channels of the MX you

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:57.559 
using the other channels of the MX you
can<00:00:55.289> manipulate<00:00:55.589> that<00:00:56.100> pattern<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:57.089> expand

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
can manipulate that pattern the expand

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.569 
can manipulate that pattern the expand
it<00:00:57.719> shrink<00:00:58.139> it<00:00:58.319> make<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.679> spin<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> rotate

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it shrink it make it spin make it rotate

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
it shrink it make it spin make it rotate
change<00:01:00.569> the<00:01:00.719> color<00:01:00.959> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.409> green<00:01:01.620> no

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
change the color you want green no

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
change the color you want green no
problem<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.459> want<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.819> blue<00:01:03.149> no<00:01:03.389> problem

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
problem you want just blue no problem

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
problem you want just blue no problem
you<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> mix<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> sy<00:01:05.700> n<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.090> no

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you want to mix it make it sy n it's no

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.819 
you want to mix it make it sy n it's no
problem<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> any<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.289> patterns<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.710> do

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
problem and any of the patterns will do

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.910 
problem and any of the patterns will do
it<00:01:07.950> including<00:01:08.430> laser<00:01:08.579> sky<00:01:08.939> wow<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.740> great

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it including laser sky wow so it's great

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
it including laser sky wow so it's great
for<00:01:11.159> throwing<00:01:11.310> patterns<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.850> walls<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:12.329> floors

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
for throwing patterns on walls or floors

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
for throwing patterns on walls or floors
but<00:01:12.780> also<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> shoot<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> crowds<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but also to shoot it over the crowds and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
but also to shoot it over the crowds and
create<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.969> sky<00:01:15.270> effect<00:01:15.630> Oh<00:01:15.869> totally<00:01:16.350> that's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
create that sky effect Oh totally that's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
create that sky effect Oh totally that's
totally<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.039> designed<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.539> very<00:01:18.539> cool

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
totally what it's designed for very cool

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
totally what it's designed for very cool
right<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.289> taking<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.829> demo<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right now you're taking a little demo of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.099 
right now you're taking a little demo of
it<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> quick<00:01:21.600> cut<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:22.079> to

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
it we're going to do a quick cut over to

00:01:22.109 --> 00:02:14.510 
it we're going to do a quick cut over to
another<00:01:22.770> view
