olympus pen ep-1 have the world's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.859 
olympus pen ep-1 have the world's
fastest<00:00:16.040> autofocus<00:00:16.219> system<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.480> we<00:00:17.599> put<00:00:17.779> that

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
fastest autofocus system and we put that

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.749 
fastest autofocus system and we put that
to<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.110> test

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
to the test

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.370

compared to the previous EP to model the
ep-3<00:00:21.680> now<00:00:22.039> I'd<00:00:22.189> say<00:00:22.369> built-in<00:00:22.789> flash<00:00:23.000> gun<00:00:23.210> on

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.560 
there's area here for big improvements
to<00:03:27.470> still<00:03:27.739> be<00:03:27.860> made<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:29.030> build<00:03:29.269> quality<00:03:29.420> is

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
to still be made the build quality is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.390 
to still be made the build quality is
very<00:03:29.630> good<00:03:29.840> overall<00:03:30.500> except<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.010> perhaps<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
very good overall except for perhaps the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.949 
very good overall except for perhaps the
new<00:03:31.519> grip<00:03:31.760> which<00:03:31.910> we're<00:03:32.090> not<00:03:32.209> overly<00:03:32.570> keen<00:03:32.780> on

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
new grip which we're not overly keen on

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.930 
new grip which we're not overly keen on
and<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.709> pictures<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.190> very<00:03:34.400> good<00:03:34.549> quality

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
and the pictures are a very good quality

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.150 
and the pictures are a very good quality
as<00:03:35.060> well<00:03:35.329> one<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.440> drawbacks<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:37.010> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
as well one of the drawbacks is the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.640 
as well one of the drawbacks is the
battery<00:03:37.610> which<00:03:37.790> has<00:03:37.820> 300<00:03:38.570> 350<00:03:39.110> shots<00:03:39.470> per

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
battery which has 300 350 shots per

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.140 
battery which has 300 350 shots per
charge<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.190> should<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.549> be<00:03:40.730> able<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.970> fit

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
charge and should really be able to fit

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.390 
charge and should really be able to fit
more<00:03:41.180> power<00:03:41.570> in<00:03:41.750> per<00:03:42.019> each<00:03:42.200> charge<00:03:42.590> but

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
more power in per each charge but

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.220 
more power in per each charge but
overall<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.150> very<00:03:44.360> strong<00:03:44.660> camera<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.170> a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
overall this is very strong camera and a

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.319 
overall this is very strong camera and a
step<00:03:45.470> forward<00:03:45.769> for<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.950> pen<00:03:46.220> series<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.209> we

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
step forward for the pen series that we

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.880 
step forward for the pen series that we
awarded<00:03:47.720> 88%<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.859> our<00:03:49.220> recommended<00:03:49.609> award
