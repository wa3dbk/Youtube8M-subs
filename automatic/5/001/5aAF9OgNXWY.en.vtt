400 one and it looks like we have some

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.830 
400 one and it looks like we have some
caps<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.580> also<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.210> cables

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.530 

next<00:02:58.840> let's<00:02:58.990> go<00:02:59.140> ahead<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.590> unbox<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.610> remote

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
next let's go ahead and unbox the remote

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.900 
next let's go ahead and unbox the remote
this<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.470> side<00:03:02.710> remote<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> camera

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
this is the side remote for the camera

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.550 
this is the side remote for the camera
itself<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.630> your<00:03:07.930> battery<00:03:08.290> grip

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
itself I think this is your battery grip

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.470 
itself I think this is your battery grip
it<00:03:09.040> has<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.730> few<00:03:11.220> programmable<00:03:12.220> keys<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.760> you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
it has a few programmable keys and you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.300 
it has a few programmable keys and you
also<00:03:13.660> select<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> batteries<00:03:14.620> right<00:03:14.950> up<00:03:15.160> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
also select the batteries right up and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.090 
also select the batteries right up and
do<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.000> screws<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.830> plug<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.860> would

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
do it and just screws on plug it would

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.890 
do it and just screws on plug it would
with<00:03:18.280> any<00:03:18.490> battery<00:03:19.240> grip<00:03:19.560> next<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:21.220> have<00:03:21.490> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
with any battery grip next we have a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.290 
with any battery grip next we have a
power<00:03:22.900> source<00:03:23.520> which<00:03:24.520> is<00:03:24.550> pretty<00:03:25.090> much<00:03:25.240> a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
power source which is pretty much a

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.410 
power source which is pretty much a
power<00:03:25.600> brick<00:03:25.900> with<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.950> thing<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.550> in<00:03:27.730> so

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
power brick with the thing to go in so

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.000 
power brick with the thing to go in so
if<00:03:28.780> you're<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.230> shooting<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.620> play<00:03:29.860> or

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
if you're going to be shooting a play or

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.290 
if you're going to be shooting a play or
something<00:03:30.070> with<00:03:30.460> this<00:03:30.610> which<00:03:30.820> we<00:03:30.970> actually

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
something with this which we actually

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.460 
something with this which we actually
did<00:03:31.540> we<00:03:31.690> shot<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.200> hobbit<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:33.360> 4k<00:03:34.360> with<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
did we shot the hobbit in 4k with the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.010 
did we shot the hobbit in 4k with the
epic<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.490> that<00:03:36.820> was<00:03:37.030> very<00:03:37.209> good<00:03:37.570> we<00:03:37.780> obviously

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
epic and that was very good we obviously

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.570 
epic and that was very good we obviously
use<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.830> we<00:03:38.920> don't<00:03:39.070> have<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.280> go<00:03:39.400> through

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
use that so we don't have to go through

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.790 
use that so we don't have to go through
a<00:03:39.640> bunch<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.880> batteries<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:41.080> then<00:03:41.350> we<00:03:41.620> have

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
a bunch of batteries and then we have

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.510 
a bunch of batteries and then we have
some<00:03:42.220> batteries<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.870> have<00:03:44.080> our<00:03:44.520> SSD

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
some batteries and then we have our SSD

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.320 
some batteries and then we have our SSD
which<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:47.940> 64<00:03:48.940> gig<00:03:49.150> cards<00:03:49.570> based<00:03:50.170> slide<00:03:50.500> in

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
which is 64 gig cards based slide in

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.580 
which is 64 gig cards based slide in
right<00:03:52.709> here

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
right here

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.369 
right here
and<00:03:55.680> then<00:03:56.129> you're<00:03:56.580> ready<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.849> shoot<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:58.290> I'm

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
and then you're ready to shoot so I'm

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.690 
and then you're ready to shoot so I'm
going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.530> come<00:03:58.680> back<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.980> second<00:03:59.370> with<00:03:59.610> this

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
going to come back in a second with this
