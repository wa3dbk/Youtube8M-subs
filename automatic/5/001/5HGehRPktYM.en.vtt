past your center level and make sure you
take<00:00:19.700> very<00:00:20.030> small<00:00:20.240> sections<00:00:21.020> if<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:22.550> take

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
take very small sections if you take

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.400 
take very small sections if you take
large<00:00:23.029> sections<00:00:23.420> you're<00:00:23.840> going<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.020> wind<00:00:24.230> up

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
large sections you're going to wind up

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.740 
large sections you're going to wind up
with<00:00:24.439> scissor<00:00:24.800> marks<00:00:25.450> so<00:00:26.450> we<00:00:26.480> want<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:26.689> take

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
with scissor marks so we want to take

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.510 
with scissor marks so we want to take
extremely<00:00:27.230> small<00:00:27.619> sections<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.369> hair

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
extremely small sections of the hair

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.580 
extremely small sections of the hair
longer<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.000> hair<00:00:29.150> on<00:00:29.330> top<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:30.170> lower<00:00:30.380> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
longer the hair on top the lower the

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.430 
longer the hair on top the lower the
taper<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.330> another<00:00:32.330> another<00:00:32.809> thing<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.260> kind

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
taper and another another thing to kind

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.080 
taper and another another thing to kind
of<00:00:33.500> remember<00:00:33.770> or<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.520> give<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:34.730> an<00:00:34.820> idea<00:00:34.910> of

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
of remember or to give you an idea of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.729 
of remember or to give you an idea of
how<00:00:35.210> high<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:35.600> go<00:00:35.660> is<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:36.260> never<00:00:36.470> want

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
how high you can go is you never want

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.250 
how high you can go is you never want
the<00:00:36.860> taper<00:00:37.100> higher<00:00:37.790> than<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.180> bang<00:00:38.360> area<00:00:38.750> so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
the taper higher than the bang area so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.110 
the taper higher than the bang area so
obviously<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.040> bang<00:00:40.220> area<00:00:40.580> is<00:00:40.640> right<00:00:40.820> around

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
obviously the bang area is right around

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.960 
obviously the bang area is right around
here<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.769> temple<00:00:43.070> area<00:00:43.220> so<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.760> can't

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
here just to the temple area so we can't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.700 
here just to the temple area so we can't
go<00:00:44.090> any<00:00:44.300> higher<00:00:44.390> than<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:45.530> actually

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
go any higher than that and we actually

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.290 
go any higher than that and we actually
got<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.040> leave<00:00:46.220> off<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.730> little<00:00:46.760> bit<00:00:47.090> lower

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
got to leave off just a little bit lower

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.120 
got to leave off just a little bit lower
so<00:00:47.450> we<00:00:47.720> leave<00:00:47.870> ourself<00:00:48.260> enough<00:00:48.530> room<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.739> blend

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
so we leave ourself enough room to blend

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.740 
so we leave ourself enough room to blend
so<00:00:49.820> we're<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.120> start<00:00:50.300> out<00:00:50.420> with<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.600> tip

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
so we're going to start out with the tip

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.319 
so we're going to start out with the tip
of<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.960> blade<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:51.680> very<00:00:51.950> slowly<00:00:52.340> arc<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
of the blade and very slowly arc the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.799 
of the blade and very slowly arc the
blade<00:00:53.570> away<00:00:53.809> from<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> head<00:00:55.360> let<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.480> Clipper

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
blade away from the head let the Clipper

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.090 
blade away from the head let the Clipper
work<00:00:58.989> down<00:00:59.989> just<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.440> drive<00:01:00.710> home<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.950> point

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
work down just to drive home the point

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.790 
work down just to drive home the point
again<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.360> didn't<00:01:02.719> do<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.200> top<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.680> work

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
again if we didn't do the top and work

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.710 
again if we didn't do the top and work
our<00:01:03.950> way<00:01:04.129> down<00:01:04.160> if<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.180> remember<00:01:05.479> how<00:01:05.600> much

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
our way down if you remember how much

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.950 
our way down if you remember how much
hair<00:01:06.020> with<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.800> customer<00:01:07.310> had<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:08.780> wouldn't

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
hair with the customer had you wouldn't

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.940 
hair with the customer had you wouldn't
be<00:01:09.020> able<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.200> do<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.440> step<00:01:09.619> there<00:01:09.830> would<00:01:09.920> be

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
be able to do this step there would be

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.499 
be able to do this step there would be
too<00:01:10.160> much<00:01:10.280> hair<00:01:10.550> here<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:10.880> would<00:01:11.030> lose<00:01:11.240> sight

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
too much hair here you would lose sight

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.969 
too much hair here you would lose sight
of<00:01:11.539> these<00:01:11.810> teeth<00:01:12.050> cutting<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.530> hair<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
of these teeth cutting the hair the

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.050 
of these teeth cutting the hair the
elephant<00:01:13.789> blade<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.899> comb<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.850> then<00:01:16.970> we

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
elephant blade on the comb and then we

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.920 
elephant blade on the comb and then we
switched<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.539> tip<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.899> blade

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
switched to the tip of the blade

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.900 
switched to the tip of the blade
and<00:01:20.770> we're<00:01:20.950> blended<00:01:21.340> kill<00:01:22.210> all<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.390> blade<00:01:23.910> to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
and we're blended kill all the blade to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.680 
and we're blended kill all the blade to
the<00:01:24.940> tip<00:01:25.180> of<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.360> blade

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.090 

so<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.800> do<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.010> we're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.310> work<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> tapering<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:34.230> tail

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
going to work on tapering out the tail

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.040 
going to work on tapering out the tail

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
in the middle so the Clippers in the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.730 
in the middle so the Clippers in the
open<00:01:37.380> position<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.230> get<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
open position now when I get to this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
open position now when I get to this
area<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.370> hairline<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:42.030> where<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> beard

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
scooping motion and then in the corners
we<00:01:51.870> don't<00:01:52.050> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.230> go<00:01:52.320> into<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.800> all<00:01:53.220> right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.360 

so<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.690> go<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.110> across

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

okay<00:02:02.370> then<00:02:02.580> we're<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.970> close<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
okay then we're going to close the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
okay then we're going to close the
Clipper<00:02:03.720> halfway<00:02:04.080> down<00:02:04.729> we're<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
Clipper halfway down we're going to do

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.110 
Clipper halfway down we're going to do
it<00:02:06.090> again<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.510> not<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.930> high
