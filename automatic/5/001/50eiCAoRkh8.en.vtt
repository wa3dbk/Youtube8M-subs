always jump in their face and then I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
always jump in their face and then I
usually<00:01:14.460> interceptor<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> then

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
usually interceptor right there and then

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840
