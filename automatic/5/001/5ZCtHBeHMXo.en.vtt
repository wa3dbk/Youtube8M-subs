strip<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> kind<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.770> stripper<00:02:21.100> these<00:02:21.220> guys

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
strip so kind of a stripper these guys

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.520 
strip so kind of a stripper these guys
is<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.940> easy<00:02:22.060> way<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.240> do<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.380> reason

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
is the easy way to do this the reason

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.640 
is the easy way to do this the reason
for<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> hole<00:02:24.460> punch<00:02:24.700> itself<00:02:25.650> is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
for that is the hole punch itself is

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.860 
for that is the hole punch itself is
only<00:02:27.220> gonna<00:02:27.430> fit<00:02:27.610> one<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.730> these<00:02:27.850> at<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> time<00:02:28.240> so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
only gonna fit one of these at a time so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
only gonna fit one of these at a time so
we<00:02:28.960> actually<00:02:29.080> want<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.440> be<00:02:29.560> able<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:30.010> hang<00:02:30.460> on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
we actually want to be able to hang on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.680 
we actually want to be able to hang on
to<00:02:30.820> these<00:02:31.740> as<00:02:32.740> we're<00:02:33.190> punching<00:02:33.430> them<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.850> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
to these as we're punching them out and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.810 
to these as we're punching them out and
that's<00:02:34.870> gonna<00:02:35.050> help<00:02:35.200> us<00:02:35.380> quit<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> bit<00:02:38.670> too<00:02:39.670> much

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
that's gonna help us quit a bit too much

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.400 
that's gonna help us quit a bit too much
about<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.020> they<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.260> need

about this and to do they do need

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.250 
about this and to do they do need
someone<00:02:44.560> petrels<00:02:45.040> tokens<00:02:45.370> actually<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.260> got

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
someone petrels tokens actually I got

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.890 
someone petrels tokens actually I got
lots<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.530> them<00:02:47.680> Tetris<00:02:48.070> dudes<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.430> my<00:02:48.459> army<00:02:48.880> and

feed them through the hole punch so what

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.230 
feed them through the hole punch so what
you<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.580> now<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.730> clip<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.090> hole<00:02:58.209> punch
