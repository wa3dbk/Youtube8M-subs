00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.259
 one collects stamps the other 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.029
 beermat 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.639
 Everyone has their own idea 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.380
 of freizeitgestaltung glass Opel man 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 and his colleague collect fish 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 Passion seven meters long and four 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 meter wide is the aquarium which in the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.570
 over time 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 with a water depth of around two 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 meters the basin comes to around 65,000 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.060
 liter what a fulfillment of around 430 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.590
 Bathtub corresponds 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 with the ones still in the house next to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.200
 basin come back around 230 were 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 for lungs which constantly between 29 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 and reach 30 degrees for it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 the animals also good is the great 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.879
 Of course, the disc has to be enormous 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 withstand water pressure 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.570
 not for nothing is here an extreme 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.700
 stable glass wall has been installed 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 So we have a slice of the 3 x 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.399
 19 millimeters glued on each other so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.260
 we come to about 6 cm the disc bends 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.910
 a very little bit after 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.320
 Outside, however, has no other problems 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 if one of these slices should travel 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.400
 would the other two slices too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 still hold 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 Every amount of fish is in the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.250
 There are seven different types of mega ponds 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 of pipes salma and welse frolicking 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.659
 in the water was so nice and peaceful 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.770
 Also has a lot of technology 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.450
 necessary we have a lot of technology so 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 it starts that we have an endless band 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 have the filter at a certain degree 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 of the pollution itself cleans 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.829
 then comes the biological treatment 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 Of course those with a lot of oxygen 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.360
 without oxygen and then the whole thing 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 aquarium of 200,000 liters 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 The hour pumps operated accurately and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 naturally also heated if the animals 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.259
 also a peaceful impression 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.390
 they are safe to provide stuffed animals 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.549
 not when la saw film to the basin 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.979
 he has to clean the diver equipment 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.020
 grab around two tons of sand remains 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 consciously away from the one there 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 buried weeks could be bad for him 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.259
 inflict injuries 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 the two friends are doing one thing here 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.369
 the largest private aquariums in 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.770
 germany it certainly belongs to a lot 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.650
 perseverance and endurance 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.489
 Such a hobby on a permanent basis 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.489
 to operate 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.789
