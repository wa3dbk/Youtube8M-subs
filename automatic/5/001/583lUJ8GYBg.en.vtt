assume the act stands for extremely
large<00:00:15.680> because<00:00:16.100> these<00:00:16.250> headphones<00:00:16.490> are<00:00:16.880> huge

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359

let's<00:00:17.779> talk<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:17.990> little<00:00:18.109> bit<00:00:18.410> of<00:00:18.470> what<00:00:18.619> I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
let's talk a little bit of what I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.829 
let's talk a little bit of what I
thought<00:00:19.070> of<00:00:19.250> these<00:00:19.400> headphones<00:00:19.699> after<00:00:20.570> having

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839 
thought of these headphones after having

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.749 
thought of these headphones after having
spent<00:00:21.050> some<00:00:21.230> time<00:00:21.410> with<00:00:21.589> them<00:00:21.740> so<00:00:22.369> to<00:00:22.429> start

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
spent some time with them so to start

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.569 
spent some time with them so to start
with<00:00:22.970> on<00:00:23.210> their<00:00:23.779> sound<00:00:24.109> these<00:00:24.679> have<00:00:25.009> a<00:00:25.310> little

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
with on their sound these have a little

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.359 
with on their sound these have a little
bit<00:00:25.759> of<00:00:26.179> a<00:00:26.480> exaggerated<00:00:27.439> bass<00:00:27.650> response<00:00:27.890> when

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
bit of a exaggerated bass response when

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.279 
bit of a exaggerated bass response when
it<00:00:28.460> comes<00:00:28.669> to<00:00:28.849> a<00:00:28.880> studio<00:00:29.240> headphone<00:00:29.810> but

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
it comes to a studio headphone but

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.440 
it comes to a studio headphone but
certainly<00:00:30.829> not<00:00:31.060> exaggerated<00:00:32.060> when<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.270> comes

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
certainly not exaggerated when it comes

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.870 
certainly not exaggerated when it comes
to<00:00:32.570> an<00:00:32.689> overall<00:00:33.020> everyday<00:00:33.620> hue<00:00:33.860> center<00:00:34.340> so

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
to an overall everyday hue center so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.520 
to an overall everyday hue center so
what<00:00:35.000> do<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:35.150> mean<00:00:35.330> by<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.690> well<00:00:36.080> essentially

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
what do I mean by that well essentially

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.100 
what do I mean by that well essentially
if<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.430> were<00:00:37.490> to<00:00:37.700> gauge<00:00:37.910> these<00:00:38.210> or<00:00:38.540> sort<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.960> you

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
if I were to gauge these or sort of you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.770 
if I were to gauge these or sort of you
know<00:00:39.140> draw<00:00:39.740> out<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.160> EQ<00:00:40.670> spectrum<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.540> how

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
know draw out the EQ spectrum on on how

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.660 
know draw out the EQ spectrum on on how
they<00:00:41.990> would<00:00:42.170> sound<00:00:42.470> in<00:00:42.680> terms<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.160> balanced

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
they would sound in terms of a balanced

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.330 
they would sound in terms of a balanced
headphone<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.570> know<00:00:44.660> we<00:00:44.780> sort<00:00:45.020> of<00:00:45.140> have<00:00:45.350> you

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
know let's show this is like what it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.150 
know let's show this is like what it
beats<00:00:47.810> by<00:00:47.990> dre<00:00:48.050> headphones<00:00:48.230> sounds<00:00:48.890> like<00:00:49.010> so

beats by dre headphones sounds like so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.850 
beats by dre headphones sounds like so
it's<00:00:49.310> kind<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.490> like<00:00:49.670> whoa<00:00:50.320> no<00:00:51.320> middle<00:00:51.680> and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
it's kind of like whoa no middle and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.980 
it's kind of like whoa no middle and
then<00:00:51.950> whoa<00:00:52.190> for<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.820> highs<00:00:53.000> right<00:00:53.450> so<00:00:53.840> you've

then whoa for the highs right so you've

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.050 
then whoa for the highs right so you've
got<00:00:54.140> a<00:00:54.170> really<00:00:54.440> exaggerated<00:00:55.220> low<00:00:55.520> hang<00:00:55.700> you

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
got a really exaggerated low hang you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.970 
got a really exaggerated low hang you
got<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.210> really<00:00:56.450> exaggerated<00:00:57.320> high<00:00:57.530> end<00:00:57.770> and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
got a really exaggerated high end and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.550 
got a really exaggerated high end and
sort<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.580> lacking<00:00:59.090> middle<00:00:59.420> when<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.350> comes

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
sort of a lacking middle when it comes

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.280 
sort of a lacking middle when it comes
to<00:01:00.710> these<00:01:00.860> headphones<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:02.000> have<00:01:02.240> a<00:01:02.630> little

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
to these headphones you have a little

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.859 
to these headphones you have a little
bit<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.710> bump<00:01:03.950> with<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.610> bass<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.180> sort<00:01:05.810> of

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
bit of a bump with the bass and sort of

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.989 
bit of a bump with the bass and sort of
a<00:01:05.990> nice<00:01:06.140> balance<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:06.859> for<00:01:07.369> everything<00:01:07.820> else

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
a nice balance for for everything else

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:10.380 
a nice balance for for everything else
so<00:01:08.630> they<00:01:08.960> have<00:01:09.320> an<00:01:09.530> increased<00:01:09.890> bass<00:01:10.100> response

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
so they have an increased bass response

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.700 
so they have an increased bass response
if<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.539> were<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.780> sort<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.049> draw<00:01:12.229> like<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.409> set

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
if you were to sort of draw like a set

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.679 
if you were to sort of draw like a set
eyes<00:01:12.859> or<00:01:13.100> they're<00:01:13.249> kind<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.520> just<00:01:13.579> like<00:01:13.820> flat

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
eyes or they're kind of just like flat

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.080 
eyes or they're kind of just like flat
you<00:01:15.079> know<00:01:15.109> it's<00:01:15.619> just<00:01:15.890> super<00:01:16.429> flat<00:01:16.759> there's

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
you know it's just super flat there's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.149 
you know it's just super flat there's
nothing<00:01:17.539> sort<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:17.990> exaggerated<00:01:18.799> about<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
nothing sort of exaggerated about the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.889 
nothing sort of exaggerated about the
bass<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.609> so<00:01:19.969> these<00:01:20.119> sort<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.569> come<00:01:20.719> in<00:01:20.869> a

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
bass and so these sort of come in a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.989 
bass and so these sort of come in a
little<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.530> over<00:01:21.770> something<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.640> when

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
little bit over something like that when

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.639 
little bit over something like that when
it<00:01:23.090> comes<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.479> bass<00:01:23.630> response<00:01:23.840> but

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
it comes to the bass response but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.160 
it comes to the bass response but
definitely<00:01:25.219> way<00:01:25.549> below<00:01:26.090> some<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.990> other

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
definitely way below some of the other

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.929 
definitely way below some of the other
headphones<00:01:27.710> from<00:01:27.950> rhythms<00:01:28.310> which<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.670> really
