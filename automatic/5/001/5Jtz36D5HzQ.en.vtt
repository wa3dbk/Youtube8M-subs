we tried him on offense but quickly

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.969 
we tried him on offense but quickly
realized<00:02:01.049> he's<00:02:01.409> probably<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
realized he's probably more of a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
realized he's probably more of a
defensive<00:02:02.130> player<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> our<00:02:03.570> first

in<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> past<00:02:06.810> set<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.530> stop<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
in a past set and you know you stop that
