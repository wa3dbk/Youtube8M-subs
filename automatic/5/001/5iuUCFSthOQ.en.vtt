going to start with talking about some
of<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:40.860> toys<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.670> came<00:00:42.090> through<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:42.960> path

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of these toys that came through my path

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.459 
of these toys that came through my path
that<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.780> creating<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.200> whole

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that are really creating a whole

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
that are really creating a whole
different<00:00:47.070> approach<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.239> doing

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
different approach to what I'm doing

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.850 
different approach to what I'm doing
sound-wise<00:00:50.390> compositional<00:00:51.390> everything<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
sound-wise compositional everything the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
sound-wise compositional everything the
first<00:00:53.100> pedal<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> talk<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first pedal that I want to talk about is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.150 
first pedal that I want to talk about is
try<00:00:54.629> logic<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.800> logic<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.370> incredible<00:00:57.030> eq

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
try logic for logic is an incredible eq

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.330 
try logic for logic is an incredible eq
that<00:00:59.239> I<00:01:00.239> started<00:01:01.230> experimenting<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that I started experimenting with it and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
that I started experimenting with it and
the<00:01:02.550> main<00:01:02.730> purpose<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> try<00:01:03.719> logic<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.229> me

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the main purpose of the try logic for me

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.000 
the main purpose of the try logic for me
is<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> vintage<00:01:05.189> instrument<00:01:06.799> 59p<00:01:07.799> base

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
is I have a vintage instrument 59p base

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
is I have a vintage instrument 59p base
that<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> don't<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.180> any<00:01:09.479> active

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that I don't want to put any active

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990 
that I don't want to put any active
electronics<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> alter

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
electronics on it I don't want to alter

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.859 
electronics on it I don't want to alter
the<00:01:12.600> already<00:01:13.530> sound<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.520> bass<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.540> through

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the already sound of the bass so through

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.160 
the already sound of the bass so through
the<00:01:16.020> try<00:01:16.229> logic<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.830> able<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:18.170> boost

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the try logic I'm able to get a boost

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
the try logic I'm able to get a boost
and<00:01:19.470> sound<00:01:20.009> tone<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.200> affect<00:01:22.710> my

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and sound tone that will not affect my

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310 
and sound tone that will not affect my
instrument<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.270> enhances<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
instrument at all it enhances it and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
instrument at all it enhances it and
basically<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.939> any<00:01:27.299> instrument

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
basically if you have any instrument

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
basically if you have any instrument
that<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.560> vintage<00:01:29.040> instrument<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.570> an

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that is a vintage instrument or just an

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.030 
that is a vintage instrument or just an
instrument<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:31.590> want<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> outer

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
instrument that you don't want to outer

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
instrument that you don't want to outer
and<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.880> able<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> some

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and you want to be able to have some

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
and you want to be able to have some
type<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.470> outboard<00:01:35.100> preamp<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.720> help

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
type of outboard preamp that will help

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.100 
type of outboard preamp that will help
you<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:38.130> enrich<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.850> sound<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.869> best

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you just enrich your sound and the best

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
you just enrich your sound and the best
way<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.500> describe<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.490> going

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
way that I can describe it is just going

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.630 
way that I can describe it is just going
from<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.329> circle<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.710> huge<00:01:44.130> circle

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
from a little circle to a huge circle

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.749 
from a little circle to a huge circle
it's<00:01:45.299> your<00:01:45.509> tone<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> make<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's your tone and you can just make it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's your tone and you can just make it
bigger<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> same<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.530> keep<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
bigger but at the same time keep the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.569 
bigger but at the same time keep the
authentic<00:01:51.210> sound<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> I'll<00:01:52.259> play<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.579> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
authentic sound and I'll play you the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
authentic sound and I'll play you the
original<00:01:53.670> sound<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> bass<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.350> I'll

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
original sound of the bass and then I'll

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
original sound of the bass and then I'll
play<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> try<00:01:56.280> logic<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.790> you'll<00:01:56.880> be

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
play you with a try logic and you'll be

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.149 
play you with a try logic and you'll be
able<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> difference<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
able to see the difference and what can

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.899 
able to see the difference and what can
the<00:01:59.610> preamp<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.549> you're<00:02:02.549> hearing<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the preamp do for you you're hearing the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.520 
the preamp do for you you're hearing the
tone<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.420> instrument<00:02:03.500> pure<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> now

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
tone of the instrument pure as is now

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
tone of the instrument pure as is now
with<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> try<00:02:07.829> logic<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.429> able<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:09.569> some

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
with the try logic I'm able to get some

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.640 
with the try logic I'm able to get some
gain<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.640> tone<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.750> bigger

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
gain and my same tone just got bigger

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
gain and my same tone just got bigger
but<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.840> distorted<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.069> by<00:02:17.069> any<00:02:17.280> way<00:02:17.489> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
but not distorted or by any way this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
but not distorted or by any way this
guy's<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.780> changed<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.500> same<00:02:19.709> tone<00:02:19.980> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
guy's was changed as the same tone that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.789 
guy's was changed as the same tone that
I<00:02:20.250> had<00:02:20.489> before<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.870> TRO<00:02:28.019> logic<00:02:28.319> offers<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.769> a

I had before the TRO logic offers you a

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.789 
I had before the TRO logic offers you a
switch<00:02:29.129> for<00:02:29.430> mid<00:02:29.910> those<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.200> low<00:02:31.530> mids

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.479 
switch for mid those in and low mids
which<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.120> crucial<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.260> get<00:02:34.920> different

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
pre-op like in my case and then you just

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.500 
pre-op like in my case and then you just
want<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.079> enhance<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.760> gives<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> gain

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
and a volume and it's one of the most

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.530 
and a volume and it's one of the most
clean<00:02:57.829> preamps<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.130> ever<00:02:59.310> tried<00:03:02.540> if

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
clean preamps that I have ever tried if

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.150 
clean preamps that I have ever tried if
you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.840> hear<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.319> same<00:03:04.709> tone<00:03:05.540> just

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
you can hear is the same tone just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.500 
you can hear is the same tone just
enhance<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.879> better<00:03:09.150> word<00:03:09.360> to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
enhance I don't have a better word to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.390 
enhance I don't have a better word to
describe<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.410> don't<00:03:10.769> feel<00:03:10.829> like<00:03:11.190> as

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.880 

mmm

mmm
by<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:30.150> kicking<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.960> preamp<00:03:31.319> in<00:03:31.470> now<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> have

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
by just kicking the preamp in now I have

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.870 
by just kicking the preamp in now I have
instead<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.990> I<00:03:36.560> got<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.730> right<00:03:41.730> now

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
instead of is I got this and right now

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.240 
instead of is I got this and right now
I'm<00:03:42.060> flat<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> still<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.470> add<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:44.040> bit

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
I'm flat so I still can add a little bit

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:57.070 
I'm flat so I still can add a little bit
more<00:03:44.459> volume<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.800> from<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.950> preamp

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.449 

and<00:03:59.120> that's<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.390> from<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.870> tri<00:04:01.080> logic<00:04:01.560> again

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
and that's just from the tri logic again

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.420 
and that's just from the tri logic again
it's<00:04:02.940> an<00:04:03.150> incredible<00:04:03.840> versatile<00:04:04.410> piece<00:04:05.280> of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
it's an incredible versatile piece of

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670 
it's an incredible versatile piece of
equipment<00:04:05.880> because<00:04:06.000> as<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.959> see<00:04:07.110> as<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> pedal

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
equipment because as you see as a pedal

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.800 
equipment because as you see as a pedal
that<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.950> can<00:04:08.130> put<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.370> your<00:04:08.459> gig<00:04:08.700> bag<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.150> you

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
that you can put in your gig bag if you

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.259 
that you can put in your gig bag if you
have<00:04:09.989> say<00:04:10.440> 23<00:04:11.070> different<00:04:11.459> bases<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.180> you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
have say 23 different bases that you

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.030 
have say 23 different bases that you
want<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.510> try<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.830> pick<00:04:14.010> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
want to try it on you can just pick it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.860 
want to try it on you can just pick it
up<00:04:14.250> use<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.820> with<00:04:14.940> one<00:04:15.120> base<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.600> said<00:04:15.750> with

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
up use it with one base you said with

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.720 
up use it with one base you said with
the<00:04:15.989> other<00:04:16.140> one<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.799> don't<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.609> an

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
the other one you don't have to have an

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.009 
the other one you don't have to have an
onboard<00:04:18.269> preamp<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:20.400> will<00:04:20.609> definitely

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
onboard preamp and it will definitely

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.900 
onboard preamp and it will definitely
really<00:04:22.019> really<00:04:22.410> change<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.460> enhance

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
really really change and enhance

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.120 
really really change and enhance
yourself<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.230> you<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
yourself so there you have it that's the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.410 
yourself so there you have it that's the
