00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.380
 we know you have been working in the usa for a long time 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.940
 constantly participate in the State Department briefings 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.550
 communicate with local officials 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 Here is such a tactic of care and such from 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 specific answers to specific questions 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.449
 at the State Department this is a frequent occurrence in 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.580
 Generally yes, but well at least there is an opportunity 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.920
 ask these questions you know even avoiding 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 the answer says a lot protective i 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 susan wines and here on the eve we became 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.930
 witness your dialogue with jennifer 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.230
 psaki let's see angel 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 Russia and pro-Russian separatists 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 illegally invaded Ukraine in that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.489
 including in Donetsk, Ukraine is obliged and has 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 full right to defend we of course 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.590
 We hope that both parties will comply 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
 conditions of the Minsk agreements but we have this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.640
 until we see and there are only masses 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.680
 talk and no real support 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the peace process of the country of Russia 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 I ask precisely the actions of the Ukrainian 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.130
 governments could you give more 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.229
 a clear answer whether these 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.439
 actions Minsk agreements could 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.360
 would not give any specifics 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.729
 I think I’ll dwell on that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.770
 said whether they match Minsk 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.750
 agreements you say action 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 Russia does not match as 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.080
 matches her actions of Ukraine yet 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 First of all, it is important 2 so that Russia 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.549
 illegally in the brake on Ukraine on 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.979
 territory of a sovereign state 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.470
 what do you mean sovereign 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.210
 the country has no right to defend myself 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.610
 I ask the actions of Ukraine you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 shy away from the world and believe everything is already 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is said that when it comes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 about the shelling of civilian objects with 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 Ukraine side you say it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.780
 requires investigation and when happens 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 the incident in which you blame 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.799
 separatists then you speak immediately 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.860
 with condemnation that’s what 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.259
 so many questions I don't think that everything 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.120
 It is as you say there are 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 cases when immediately 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.330
 the name is required and is required 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.280
 investigation into the fine discussion in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 General psaki so nothing really said 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.900
 yes you know I was direct like me 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 it seemed a simple question namely 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 Does Ukraine act ? 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 Minsk agreements like 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.300
 get an answer yes or no i was 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 obviously and not only to me it seems that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 the representative tried to get away from direct 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.860
 answer question all the time 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.850
 leading the conversation away raise 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.250
 State Department thinks about Russia you already 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 understood to get an answer about how the us 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.640
 regard the actions of Ukraine was 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 impossible at this briefing
