00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.960
 for me 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.940
 from now the university of 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.830
 Seville will not withdraw or suspend or 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.629
 expelling students who are 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.009
 catch by copying on an exam if a 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.779
 teacher discovers a student 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.700
 doing it you will have to let it finish 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.560
 the test and inform in writing to a 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020
 commission that will decide if the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.119
 student has copied or not and what measure should 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.980
 adopt in this respect we have 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.510
 wanted to know the opinion of the community 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.180
 university in the region about this 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.769
 issue in centers like the ucam understand 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.660
 that these kinds of issues should 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:39.000
 solve in the classroom 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.649
 examining yourself is a right of the student is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 the argument that is based on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.269
 The University of Seville to adopt 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 this measure a regulation that despite 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.980
 be respectable attending to freedom 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.379
 of autonomy of the universities could 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.809
 have negative consequences between 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.239
 they the excessive bureaucratization of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.269
 issue or the empowerment of the picaresque 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.970
 among the students and it is used then 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.190
 to delay a resolution of the professor 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.460
 to occasionally question the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.670
 figure of the teacher and well then this 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 can really make the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 problem of what is really 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 when I usually say it's a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.140
 situation that is usually solved in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 the classroom in centers like the university 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 catholic are antonio prefer to bet 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.229
 by alternative measures such as 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.450
 student awareness or 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.789
 education in values ​​to avoid that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.900
 students copy in an exam colors 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:39.010
 for a conviviality 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.530
 that also implies in many cases 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.870
 respect for the authority of the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.730
 cohabitation or relationships in terms 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:51.640
 of cooperation of equal respect for 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.680
 other non-polemic partners aside 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.300
 the best option to pass an exam 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.300
 it's still this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.659
