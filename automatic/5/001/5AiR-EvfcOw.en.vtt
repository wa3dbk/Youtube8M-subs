00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
another standout for me and the reason

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.120 
another standout for me and the reason
that<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.799> stands<00:03:54.070> out<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.700> well<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:56.140> yes<00:03:56.950> it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
that it stands out so well is the yes it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.039 
that it stands out so well is the yes it
does<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.459> a<00:03:57.489> lot<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.790> electric<00:03:58.420> guitar<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:58.900> it

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
does have a lot of electric guitar on it

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.020 
does have a lot of electric guitar on it
and<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.320> electric<00:03:59.739> guitar<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.850> well

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
and the electric guitar is really well

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.300 
and the electric guitar is really well
done<00:04:01.060> but<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.200> thing<00:04:02.230> about<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
done but the thing about it is the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.150 
done but the thing about it is the
melody<00:04:03.730> guitar<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.600> actually<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.230> steel<00:04:05.799> guitar

the only complaint that I really do have

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:42.049 
the only complaint that I really do have
is<00:05:40.349> the<00:05:40.619> vocals<00:05:40.979> are<00:05:41.069> a<00:05:41.129> little<00:05:41.399> distant<00:05:41.879> they

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:42.059 
is the vocals are a little distant they

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.249 
is the vocals are a little distant they

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
could have been closer in the mix

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.529 
could have been closer in the mix
brought<00:05:43.679> up<00:05:43.829> a<00:05:43.949> little<00:05:44.219> bit<00:05:44.399> they<00:05:45.239> kind<00:05:45.479> of

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
brought up a little bit they kind of

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.799 
brought up a little bit they kind of
seem<00:05:45.779> a<00:05:45.839> little<00:05:46.169> far<00:05:46.499> away<00:05:46.759> and<00:05:47.759> it<00:05:48.149> feels<00:05:48.479> like

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:48.809
