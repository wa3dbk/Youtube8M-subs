okay<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.490> little<00:00:02.970> bit<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> little

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay now this is a little bit a little

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.849 
okay now this is a little bit a little
bit<00:00:03.540> interesting<00:00:04.020> because<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.560> I'm

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
bit interesting because I'm going to I'm

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.400 
bit interesting because I'm going to I'm
going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.130> go<00:00:05.310> into<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.970> phase<00:00:06.960> here<00:00:07.230> we're

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
going to go into this phase here we're

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.230 
going to go into this phase here we're
going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.589> talk<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:07.890> plenty<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.670> then<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
going to talk about plenty and then you

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.030 
going to talk about plenty and then you
see<00:00:09.480> how<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.929> all<00:00:10.080> relates<00:00:10.880> hate<00:00:11.880> money<00:00:13.040> these

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
see how it all relates hate money these

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120 
see how it all relates hate money these

as your purchasing power are all codes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
as your purchasing power are all codes
they<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.750> greed<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.350> value<00:00:23.010> both<00:00:23.670> as

specific<00:00:24.630> frequency<00:00:25.289> I'm<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> explain

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
specific frequency I'm going to explain

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859 
specific frequency I'm going to explain
a<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.640> more<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.029> frequency<00:00:27.630> for

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
a little bit more about frequency for

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
a little bit more about frequency for
those<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> might<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.769> familiar<00:00:28.920> they

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
those of you might not be familiar they

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.120 
those of you might not be familiar they

collective your brain is automatically
programmed<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.590> identify<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:42.059> globe<00:00:42.350> which

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
programmed to identify the globe which

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
would be the agreed on energetic values

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
would be the agreed on energetic values
you<00:00:47.579> therefore<00:00:48.149> stay<00:00:48.210> within<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> confines

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you therefore stay within the confines

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.760 
you therefore stay within the confines
of<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.370> code<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.480> value<00:00:51.930> placed<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.440> each

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of that code the value placed on each

of that code the value placed on each
increment<00:00:53.280> such<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.120> $20<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.070> my

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
increment such as $20 and so on so my

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.410 
increment such as $20 and so on so my
point<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.180> making<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.129> these<00:00:59.420> what

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
point here that I'm making is these what

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
point here that I'm making is these what
we<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.930> spend<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.800> call<00:01:02.039> money

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we what we spend what we call money

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
we what we spend what we call money
which<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.660> lives

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
which is really what all of our lives

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
which is really what all of our lives
are<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.439> tied<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> like

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
are really tied into this is like

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
are really tied into this is like
ultimately<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.670> end-all<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.630> all

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
ultimately the end-all to what we all

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.920 
ultimately the end-all to what we all
seem<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.729> thing<00:01:12.740> what<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.890> call

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
seem to see is this thing what we call

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
seem to see is this thing what we call
identify<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.229> $20<00:01:16.979> $50<00:01:17.700> whatever<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> case

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
identify as $20 $50 whatever the case

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.100 
identify as $20 $50 whatever the case
may<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.979> codes<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.600> wonder

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
may be these are all codes you wonder

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
may be these are all codes you wonder
how<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:24.030> figure<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:25.380> $50<00:01:26.130> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
how you can figure what $50 really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
how you can figure what $50 really
represents<00:01:27.210> okay<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.650> we're<00:01:29.040> dealing

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
represents okay because we're dealing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.320 
represents okay because we're dealing
with<00:01:29.369> energy<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.659> important

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
with energy it's really important

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.260 
with energy it's really important
to<00:01:31.420> understand<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.800> everything<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.820> linked

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
to understand that everything is linked

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.760 
to understand that everything is linked
to<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> pattern<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:36.300> $50<00:01:37.300> in<00:01:37.630> your<00:01:38.020> mind<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
to a pattern that $50 in your mind and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.640 
to a pattern that $50 in your mind and
in<00:01:38.860> my<00:01:39.040> mind<00:01:39.420> collectively<00:01:40.420> you<00:01:40.870> have<00:01:41.080> agreed

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
in my mind collectively you have agreed

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.690 
in my mind collectively you have agreed
on<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.330> frequency<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:45.130> immediately

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
on what that frequency is so immediately

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.090 
on what that frequency is so immediately
you<00:01:45.880> hear<00:01:46.060> $50<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.960> your<00:01:47.140> mom<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.410> cannot<00:01:47.770> even

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
you hear $50 in your mom you cannot even

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.850 
you hear $50 in your mom you cannot even
we<00:01:48.700> could<00:01:48.910> not<00:01:49.060> even<00:01:49.360> try<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.570> write<00:01:49.900> down<00:01:49.930> what

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
we could not even try to write down what

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.700 
we could not even try to write down what
that<00:01:51.040> means<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.550> us<00:01:51.580> but<00:01:52.180> we<00:01:52.330> all<00:01:52.570> have<00:01:53.080> this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
that means to us but we all have this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.620 
that means to us but we all have this
code<00:01:54.160> of<00:01:54.700> what<00:01:55.000> $50<00:01:55.630> represents<00:01:56.230> okay<00:01:57.570> okay<00:01:58.570> so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
code of what $50 represents okay okay so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.290 
code of what $50 represents okay okay so
how<00:01:58.900> does<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.110> work<00:01:59.500> well<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.670> most<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.210> all

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
how does this work well in most of all

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.930 
how does this work well in most of all
societies<00:02:02.080> throughout<00:02:02.530> time<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.640> have<00:02:03.790> been

these classes are aware that they are

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
are in in other words you can only

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.520 
are in in other words you can only
fathom<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.739> monetary<00:02:36.519> value<00:02:37.450> assigned<00:02:38.230> to

fathom the monetary value assigned to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.210 
fathom the monetary value assigned to
that<00:02:39.220> class<00:02:39.700> codes<00:02:40.120> there<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.500> specific

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that class codes there is a specific

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.630 
that class codes there is a specific
level<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.900> current<00:02:43.900> hence<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.769> word<00:02:44.920> currency

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
level of current hence the word currency

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.630

which<00:02:46.540> flows<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.230> each<00:02:47.380> class<00:02:47.680> okay<00:02:48.280> I'm<00:02:48.519> going

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
which flows in each class okay I'm going

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.699 
which flows in each class okay I'm going
to<00:02:48.700> go<00:02:48.850> into<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.209> little<00:02:49.420> bit<00:02:49.630> deeper<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
to go into that little bit deeper the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.940 
to go into that little bit deeper the
lower<00:02:50.980> class<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.760> unfamiliar<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.680> code

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
lower class is unfamiliar with the code

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.750 
lower class is unfamiliar with the code
associated<00:02:54.700> with<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.900> upper<00:02:56.260> class<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
associated with the upper class and the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.220 
associated with the upper class and the
extremes<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.810> value<00:02:59.440> assigned

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
extremes in value assigned

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.759 
extremes in value assigned
these<00:03:00.560> two<00:03:00.890> classes<00:03:01.550> are<00:03:01.849> at<00:03:02.030> opposite<00:03:02.480> ends

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
these two classes are at opposite ends

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.180 
these two classes are at opposite ends
okay<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.489> basically<00:03:04.760> what<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.390> saying<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:06.190> we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
okay so basically what I'm saying is we

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.680 
okay so basically what I'm saying is we
are<00:03:07.489> taught<00:03:07.909> from<00:03:08.330> day<00:03:08.690> one<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:11.420> were

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
are taught from day one that we were

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.589 
are taught from day one that we were
really<00:03:12.200> assigned<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.610> class<00:03:14.000> we<00:03:14.480> are

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
really assigned to a class we are

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.690 
really assigned to a class we are
assigned<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.170> whether<00:03:15.409> we<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.799> in<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.459> lower

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
assigned to whether we are in the lower

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580 
assigned to whether we are in the lower
class<00:03:17.060> or<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.660> middle<00:03:17.930> class<00:03:18.140> or<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.560> upper

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
class or the middle class or the upper

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.970 
class or the middle class or the upper
middle<00:03:19.040> class<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:19.879> all<00:03:20.150> codes<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.379> begin

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
middle class it's all codes so you begin

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.070 
middle class it's all codes so you begin
to<00:03:22.310> live<00:03:22.760> by<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.060> code<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.870> your

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
to live by that code and your

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.309 
to live by that code and your
understanding<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:25.160> money<00:03:25.549> is<00:03:26.090> only<00:03:26.750> then

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
understanding of money is only then

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.640 
understanding of money is only then
defined<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.370> understood<00:03:28.690> by<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:30.110> class

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
defined and understood by that class

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.860 
defined and understood by that class
structure<00:03:31.519> you're<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.909> you<00:03:32.510> cannot

understand what it is to be a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.140 
understand what it is to be a
billionaire<00:03:35.329> if<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.900> are<00:03:36.110> not<00:03:36.379> in<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.579> class

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
billionaire if you are not in that class

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.400 
billionaire if you are not in that class
that<00:03:38.209> code<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.859> are<00:03:39.890> only<00:03:40.340> familiar<00:03:41.230> with<00:03:42.230> the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that code you are only familiar with the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.130 
that code you are only familiar with the
coding<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.310> class<00:03:43.879> that<00:03:44.629> you're<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:44.810> does

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
coding of the class that you're in does

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.530 
coding of the class that you're in does
that<00:03:45.170> make<00:03:45.440> sense<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.829> everybody<00:03:46.209> okay<00:03:47.209> you're

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that make sense to everybody okay you're

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.800 
that make sense to everybody okay you're
only<00:03:47.900> familiar<00:03:48.109> with<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.970> so<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.599> is

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
only familiar with that so and this is

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.220 
only familiar with that so and this is
extremely<00:03:51.290> important<00:03:52.280> because<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:54.049> are

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
extremely important because you are

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.880 
extremely important because you are
patterning<00:03:54.950> your<00:03:55.220> your<00:03:55.609> inference

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
patterning your your inference

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.319 
patterning your your inference
throughout<00:03:57.890> your<00:03:58.040> life<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.760> first<00:03:59.000> six

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
throughout your life for the first six

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.569 
throughout your life for the first six
years<00:03:59.450> especially<00:04:00.970> has<00:04:01.970> prepared<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:03.140> to

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
years especially has prepared you to

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.920 
years especially has prepared you to
either<00:04:04.810> work<00:04:05.810> very<00:04:06.230> hard<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:07.239> attempting<00:04:08.239> to

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
either work very hard and attempting to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.879 
either work very hard and attempting to
be<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.380> part<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:10.239> one<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.269> these<00:04:11.450> structures

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
be a part of one of these structures

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.099 
be a part of one of these structures
except<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.459> lower<00:04:13.940> class<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.630> don't<00:04:14.810> want<00:04:15.019> to

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
except the lower class you don't want to

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.560 
except the lower class you don't want to
be<00:04:15.260> there<00:04:15.560> so<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:16.639> you<00:04:16.789> do<00:04:17.090> everything

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
be there so would you do everything

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.289 
be there so would you do everything
possible<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.500> try<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.220> get<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.849> these<00:04:20.000> other

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
possible to try to get to these other

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.409 
possible to try to get to these other
class<00:04:20.959> structures<00:04:21.739> these<00:04:21.979> other<00:04:22.220> codes<00:04:22.580> but

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
class structures these other codes but

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.850 
class structures these other codes but
there's<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.690> whole<00:04:23.930> lot<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.349> other<00:04:24.590> things

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
there's a whole lot of other things

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.240 
there's a whole lot of other things
going<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.400> there<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.889> don't<00:04:27.889> have

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
going on in there that if you don't have

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.909 
going on in there that if you don't have
these<00:04:28.729> certain<00:04:29.260> imprints<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.380> begin<00:04:30.680> with

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
these certain imprints to begin with

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.960 
these certain imprints to begin with
this<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.849> not<00:04:32.000> going<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.270> happen<00:04:32.539> for<00:04:32.720> you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
this is not going to happen for you

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.610 
this is not going to happen for you
because<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.600> got<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> whole<00:04:34.020> lot<00:04:34.200> of<00:04:34.230> blocks

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
because you got a whole lot of blocks

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.560 
because you got a whole lot of blocks
that<00:04:34.830> tell<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.030> not<00:04:36.240> possible

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
that tell you that is not possible

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.440 
that tell you that is not possible
anyway<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:38.280> you're<00:04:38.460> planning<00:04:38.790> against

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
anyway so you're planning against

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.480 
anyway so you're planning against
yourself<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.200> can't<00:04:40.500> make<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.220> next

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
yourself you can't make it to the next

you<00:04:42.540> just<00:04:42.780> can't<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.200> you're<00:04:43.380> stuck<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.800> that

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
you just can't so you're stuck in that

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.310 
you just can't so you're stuck in that
class<00:04:44.220> you're<00:04:44.730> stuck<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.300> coding<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:46.020> that

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.250 
class you're stuck in the coding of that
class<00:04:47.480> okay<00:04:48.480> okay<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.500> we<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:50.070> further<00:04:51.260> see

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
class okay okay so we can further see

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.910 
class okay okay so we can further see
the<00:04:52.650> use<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:54.060> parent<00:04:54.690> okay<00:04:55.290> in<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
the use of this parent okay in the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.150 
the use of this parent okay in the
digital<00:04:56.430> age<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:57.410> concept<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.560> money<00:04:58.890> is

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
digital age the concept of money is

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.490 
digital age the concept of money is
becoming<00:04:59.790> digital<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.780> simply<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
becoming digital it's simply the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.010 
becoming digital it's simply the
assignment<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.490> numbers<00:05:03.120> being<00:05:03.510> moved<00:05:03.810> around

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
assignment of numbers being moved around

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.610 
assignment of numbers being moved around
the<00:05:04.500> numbers<00:05:05.280> represent<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.360> current<00:05:06.870> the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
the numbers represent the current the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.840 
the numbers represent the current the
flow<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.610> flow<00:05:08.640> each<00:05:09.450> is<00:05:09.840> opposed<00:05:10.640> simply<00:05:11.640> an

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
flow the flow each is opposed simply an

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.110 
flow the flow each is opposed simply an
assigned<00:05:12.510> value<00:05:13.140> perhaps<00:05:13.560> only

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
assigned value perhaps only

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.550 
assigned value perhaps only
psychological<00:05:15.120> but<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.540> point<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.380> you

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
psychological but the point is that you

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.850 
psychological but the point is that you
are<00:05:16.590> programmed<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:18.150> understand<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.500> there

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
are programmed to understand that there

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.550 
are programmed to understand that there
is<00:05:19.890> a<00:05:20.370> coding<00:05:21.000> system<00:05:21.270> which<00:05:21.870> supports<00:05:22.110> your

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
is a coding system which supports your

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.340 
is a coding system which supports your
purchasing<00:05:23.310> power<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.450> relate<00:05:25.080> to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
purchasing power and so you relate to

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.010 
purchasing power and so you relate to
these<00:05:25.680> numbers<00:05:26.280> according<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.120> your<00:05:27.480> assigned

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
these numbers according to your assigned

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.970 
these numbers according to your assigned
class<00:05:28.380> globe<00:05:29.300> okay<00:05:30.330> hence<00:05:31.050> you've<00:05:31.710> got<00:05:31.860> the

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
class globe okay hence you've got the

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.920 
class globe okay hence you've got the
IRS<00:05:32.520> make<00:05:33.240> sure<00:05:33.510> they<00:05:34.200> categorize<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.930> now

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
IRS make sure they categorize you now

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.290 
IRS make sure they categorize you now
question<00:05:37.470> it<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:37.800> know<00:05:38.010> you're<00:05:38.250> in<00:05:38.940> one<00:05:39.270> of

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
question it you know you're in one of

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.060 
question it you know you're in one of
those<00:05:39.510> categories<00:05:40.169> there<00:05:40.350> but<00:05:40.590> they<00:05:40.860> know

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
those categories there but they know

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.510 
those categories there but they know
they<00:05:41.760> got<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.060> in<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.240> category

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
they got you in that category

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.220 
they got you in that category
okay<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:44.580> we're<00:05:44.940> basically<00:05:45.230> psychologically

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
okay so we're basically psychologically

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.170 
okay so we're basically psychologically
tied<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.590> these<00:05:46.710> codes

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
tied to these codes

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.090 
tied to these codes
we're<00:05:48.480> going<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.930> or<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.650> polar<00:05:49.830> break

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
we're going to or the polar break

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.480 
we're going to or the polar break
earlier<00:05:50.690> so<00:05:51.690> we<00:05:51.870> tend<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.290> aspire<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.890> climb

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
earlier so we tend to aspire to climb

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.810 
earlier so we tend to aspire to climb
the<00:05:53.820> class<00:05:54.150> web<00:05:54.540> okay<00:05:55.530> now<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.520> is<00:05:56.580> all

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
the class web okay now this is all
