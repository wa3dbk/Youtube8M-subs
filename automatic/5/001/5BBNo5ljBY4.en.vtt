that<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:18.470> if<00:00:19.470> you've<00:00:19.740> already<00:00:20.279> seen<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
that first if you've already seen it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.679 
that first if you've already seen it
stay<00:00:21.840> right<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.660> happens

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
stay right here so this is what happens

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.029 
stay right here so this is what happens
behind<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.680> scenes<00:00:26.960> if<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.349> come<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
behind the scenes if we come from this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.100 
behind the scenes if we come from this
direction<00:00:30.439> we<00:00:31.439> will<00:00:32.070> activate<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.149> detects

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
direction we will activate this detects

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.729 
direction we will activate this detects
rail<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.600> turn<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:37.050> send<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> signal

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
rail and that in turn will send a signal

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.990 
rail and that in turn will send a signal
to<00:00:38.750> pulse<00:00:39.750> limiter<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.579> for

to pulse limiter which we also use for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
to pulse limiter which we also use for
another<00:00:42.059> purpose<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.469> safety

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
another purpose and that is for safety

when no one coming traffic is coming you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
when no one coming traffic is coming you
don't<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> activate<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> system<00:00:48.660> behind

don't want to activate the system behind

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
don't want to activate the system behind

small<00:02:03.600> ledge<00:02:04.100> I'm<00:02:05.100> doing<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.579> those<00:02:05.790> changes

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
small ledge I'm doing all those changes

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.290 
small ledge I'm doing all those changes
so<00:02:06.899> clicking<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.119> activating<00:02:09.119> that

so clicking that activating that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
so clicking that activating that
flipping<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.229> Junction<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.930> remember<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
flipping that Junction now remember the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.720 
flipping that Junction now remember the
detector<00:02:14.370> rail<00:02:15.470> that's<00:02:16.470> used<00:02:16.830> when<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.580> are

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
detector rail that's used when there are

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.290 
detector rail that's used when there are
several<00:02:18.600> people<00:02:19.790> coming<00:02:20.790> from<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.030> direction

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
several people coming from the direction

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.860 
several people coming from the direction
that<00:02:21.720> activate<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.530> system<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.940> two

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that activate to the system so if two

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.980 
that activate to the system so if two
players<00:02:25.440> are<00:02:25.770> coming<00:02:26.160> over<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.720> first

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
players are coming over there the first

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.410 
players are coming over there the first
will<00:02:28.140> activate<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.890> waiting<00:02:29.340> area<00:02:29.640> sounding

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
will activate this waiting area sounding

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870 
will activate this waiting area sounding
oncoming<00:02:31.320> traffic<00:02:31.560> onto<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.430> waiting

oncoming traffic onto this waiting

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.370 
oncoming traffic onto this waiting
around<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.640> player<00:02:36.060> will<00:02:36.570> also<00:02:37.140> all

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
around but that player will also all

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.480 
around but that player will also all
players<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:38.430> also<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.570> tech<00:02:39.930> trail

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
players will also have this tech trail

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.980 
players will also have this tech trail
activating<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.670> waiting<00:02:42.060> area<00:02:42.420> over<00:02:42.810> there

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
activating the waiting area over there

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.050 
activating the waiting area over there
so<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.800> second<00:02:44.280> player<00:02:44.520> coming<00:02:44.820> from

so that the second player coming from

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.510 
so that the second player coming from
that<00:02:45.120> direction<00:02:45.560> won't<00:02:46.560> collide<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
that direction won't collide with this

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020 
that direction won't collide with this
one<00:02:47.790> once<00:02:48.090> he's<00:02:48.300> released<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> this

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
one once he's released and so this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.840 
one once he's released and so this
detect<00:02:51.450> rail<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.680> wired<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.450> same<00:02:54.450> way<00:02:54.720> as

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
detect rail just wired up same way as

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.640 
detect rail just wired up same way as
this<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.150> which<00:02:57.330> activates<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.140> system<00:02:58.500> over

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
this one which activates the system over

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.510 
this one which activates the system over
normally<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:03.330> most<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
normally and I think that's most of it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.340 
normally and I think that's most of it
they<00:03:05.520> are<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:05.760> identical<00:03:06.330> these<00:03:06.690> waiting

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
they are not identical these waiting

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.420 
they are not identical these waiting
areas<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:07.980> yeah<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:10.070> intense<00:03:11.070> build

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
areas because yeah I just intense build

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.170 
areas because yeah I just intense build
just<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.920> ended<00:03:13.920> up<00:03:14.010> making<00:03:14.280> two<00:03:14.640> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
just one then I ended up making two and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.120 
just one then I ended up making two and
I<00:03:15.270> haven't<00:03:15.600> found<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.170> wiring<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.890> so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
I haven't found the wiring for it so

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 
I haven't found the wiring for it so
yeah<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.790> functions<00:03:18.269> are<00:03:18.420> exactly<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.170> same

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
yeah the functions are exactly the same

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
yeah the functions are exactly the same
bow<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:21.750> slightly<00:03:22.200> different<00:03:22.830> wiring<00:03:23.330> if

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
bow just slightly different wiring if

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.660 
bow just slightly different wiring if
you<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.750> any<00:03:24.959> questions<00:03:25.530> or<00:03:26.060> if<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:28.549> want<00:03:29.549> to
