them and whichever foot comes out is the
one<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.200> they<00:01:12.410> probably<00:01:12.770> are<00:01:13.070> going<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.370> lead

nope step back there you go it's okay

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.630 
nope step back there you go it's okay
let's<00:01:40.100> try<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.310> again

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
let's try it again

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.780 
let's try it again
stand<00:01:40.880> tall<00:01:41.270> yeah<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:43.070> step<00:01:43.280> four<00:01:43.490> with<00:01:43.640> your

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
stand tall yeah just step four with your

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.810 
stand tall yeah just step four with your
lead<00:01:43.940> leg<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.390> stick<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.290> good<00:01:45.920> stop<00:01:46.250> all

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
lead leg and stick it good stop all

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.520 
lead leg and stick it good stop all
right<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> couple<00:01:47.570> things<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.260> we're

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
right so a couple things that we're

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.320 
right so a couple things that we're
going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.770> want<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.040> do<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.370> adjust<00:01:49.490> Brandon<00:01:50.180> is

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
going to want to do to adjust Brandon is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.290 
going to want to do to adjust Brandon is
to<00:01:50.930> make<00:01:51.200> sure<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.800> base<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.670> foundation

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
to make sure that base that foundation

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.540 
to make sure that base that foundation
of<00:01:53.420> his<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.870> nice<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.290> stable<00:01:54.830> for<00:01:55.040> him<00:01:55.160> right

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
of his is nice and stable for him right

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.640 
of his is nice and stable for him right
because<00:01:55.790> if<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.000> base<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.810> too<00:01:57.020> narrow<00:01:57.200> you're

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
because if the base is too narrow you're

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.750 
because if the base is too narrow you're
going<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.860> lose<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.070> little<00:01:58.250> bit<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.460> lateral

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
going to lose a little bit of lateral

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.600 
going to lose a little bit of lateral
stability<00:01:59.020> if<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.170> base<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.530> too<00:02:00.770> wide<00:02:01.190> that's

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
stability if the base is too wide that's

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.980 
stability if the base is too wide that's
a<00:02:01.700> little<00:02:01.880> unnecessary<00:02:02.180> you're<00:02:02.780> going<00:02:02.930> to

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
a little unnecessary you're going to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.750 
a little unnecessary you're going to
probably<00:02:03.320> be<00:02:03.590> airborne<00:02:04.100> longer<00:02:04.550> than<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
probably be airborne longer than you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.300 
probably be airborne longer than you
need<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:05.060> be<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.450> well<00:02:06.140> executed<00:02:06.710> jerk<00:02:06.980> has<00:02:07.190> it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
need to be a well executed jerk has it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.340 
need to be a well executed jerk has it
time<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:07.970> you're<00:02:08.090> hitting<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.930> exact

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
time so that you're hitting the exact

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.860 
time so that you're hitting the exact
distance<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.430> need<00:02:10.700> without<00:02:11.120> spending

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
distance that you need without spending

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.570 
distance that you need without spending
or<00:02:12.020> wasting<00:02:12.410> extra<00:02:12.770> effort<00:02:13.160> trying<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.430> go

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
or wasting extra effort trying to go

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.339 
or wasting extra effort trying to go
wider

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
wider

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.050 
wider

let's go ahead and have you step forward
a<00:02:23.139> little<00:02:23.290> bit<00:02:23.379> more<00:02:23.819> good<00:02:24.819> start<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.359> inch

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
a little bit more good start to inch

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.399 
a little bit more good start to inch
that<00:02:25.719> forward

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
that forward

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.640 
that forward
okay<00:02:27.249> now<00:02:27.819> partial<00:02:28.599> bend<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.139> back<00:02:29.349> leg

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
okay now partial bend in the back leg

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.949 
okay now partial bend in the back leg
the<00:02:29.950> heel<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.879> going<00:02:30.939> to<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.269> slightly<00:02:31.599> off<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the heel is going to be slightly off the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.440 
the heel is going to be slightly off the
floor<00:02:32.139> right<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.250> he<00:02:33.489> will<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.879> on<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> balls

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
floor right so he will be on the balls

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.039 
floor right so he will be on the balls
of<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.780> feet

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
of the feet

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.929 
of the feet
and<00:02:35.260> we're<00:02:35.799> talking<00:02:36.010> balls<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.639> the<00:02:36.730> feet

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
and we're talking balls of the feet

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.520 
and we're talking balls of the feet
across<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.450> top<00:02:37.659> of<00:02:37.689> the<00:02:37.870> straps<00:02:38.170> we're<00:02:38.409> not

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
across the top of the straps we're not

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.550 
across the top of the straps we're not
talking<00:02:39.069> toes<00:02:39.939> right<00:02:40.719> which<00:02:40.989> would<00:02:41.169> have<00:02:41.349> them

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
talking toes right which would have them

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.979 
talking toes right which would have them
kind<00:02:41.919> of<00:02:41.980> pivoted<00:02:42.459> up<00:02:42.639> a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.450> too<00:02:43.689> far

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
kind of pivoted up a little too far

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.409 
kind of pivoted up a little too far
that's<00:02:44.409> completely<00:02:44.859> unnecessary<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> balls

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
that's completely unnecessary so balls

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.959 
that's completely unnecessary so balls
of<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.629> feet<00:02:46.810> here<00:02:47.169> the<00:02:47.919> toe<00:02:48.219> is<00:02:48.430> pretty<00:02:48.730> much

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
of the feet here the toe is pretty much

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.520 
of the feet here the toe is pretty much
going<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.299> be<00:02:49.419> pointing<00:02:50.019> straight<00:02:50.400> forward<00:02:51.400> if

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
going to be pointing straight forward if

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.949 
going to be pointing straight forward if
not<00:02:53.530> wedged<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.699> a<00:02:54.730> little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.239> right

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
not wedged in a little bit right

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.479 
not wedged in a little bit right
straight<00:02:56.439> forward<00:02:56.769> if<00:02:56.859> not<00:02:57.010> wedged<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.459> a

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
straight forward if not wedged in a

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.830 
straight forward if not wedged in a
little<00:02:57.790> bit<00:02:57.939> and<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.659> does

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
little bit and what that does

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.689 
little bit and what that does
mechanically<00:02:59.560> at<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> hip<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.340> creates<00:03:00.639> a

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
mechanically at the hip is it creates a

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.459 
mechanically at the hip is it creates a
little<00:03:00.879> stability<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.659> his<00:03:01.870> trunk<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.349> the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
little stability so his trunk and the

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.990 
little stability so his trunk and the
barbell<00:03:02.829> can<00:03:03.040> get<00:03:03.159> anchored<00:03:03.430> right<00:03:03.760> through

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
barbell can get anchored right through

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.479 
barbell can get anchored right through
the<00:03:04.090> center<00:03:04.389> now<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.900> don't<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:09.129> should

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the center now if you don't you should

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.059 
the center now if you don't you should
pretty<00:03:09.819> much<00:03:10.090> go<00:03:10.329> there<00:03:10.569> automatically<00:03:11.409> right

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
pretty much go there automatically right

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.490 
pretty much go there automatically right
if<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.879> don't<00:03:13.209> go<00:03:13.389> there<00:03:13.569> automatically<00:03:14.260> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
if you don't go there automatically and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.839 
if you don't go there automatically and
your<00:03:14.680> toe<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.010> pretty<00:03:15.280> much<00:03:15.430> straight<00:03:15.609> on

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
your toe is pretty much straight on

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.719 
your toe is pretty much straight on
that's<00:03:16.209> okay<00:03:16.659> don't<00:03:16.989> try<00:03:17.199> to<00:03:17.260> find<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.799> what<00:03:18.609> we

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
that's okay don't try to find it what we

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.189 
that's okay don't try to find it what we
definitely<00:03:19.150> don't<00:03:19.269> want<00:03:19.509> to<00:03:19.569> see<00:03:19.629> is<00:03:19.870> we<00:03:20.019> don't

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
definitely don't want to see is we don't

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.110 
definitely don't want to see is we don't
want<00:03:20.439> to<00:03:20.500> see<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.799> foot<00:03:21.159> turn<00:03:21.579> out<00:03:21.819> right

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
want to see that foot turn out right

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.670 
want to see that foot turn out right
that<00:03:22.299> exposes<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> hip<00:03:23.139> did<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.349> little<00:03:23.470> bit<00:03:23.590> of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
that exposes the hip did a little bit of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.050 
that exposes the hip did a little bit of
rotation<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.430> definitely<00:03:24.549> don't<00:03:24.759> want<00:03:24.909> to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
rotation and we definitely don't want to

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.759 
rotation and we definitely don't want to
start<00:03:25.269> rotating<00:03:25.449> underneath<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.290> heavy<00:03:26.470> load

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
start rotating underneath a heavy load

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.920 
start rotating underneath a heavy load
again<00:03:27.579> that's<00:03:27.729> going<00:03:27.879> to<00:03:27.939> create<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.269> element

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
again that's going to create a element

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.399 
again that's going to create a element
of<00:03:29.019> instability<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:30.549> from<00:03:31.449> here<00:03:31.810> we<00:03:32.079> can<00:03:32.229> see

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
of instability now from here we can see

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.809 
of instability now from here we can see
that<00:03:32.439> leg<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:32.919> in<00:03:33.159> a<00:03:33.250> little<00:03:33.459> bit<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.609> extension

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
that leg is in a little bit of extension

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.080 
that leg is in a little bit of extension
behind<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.449> hip<00:03:35.250> trunk<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.400> nice<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.849> tall

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
behind the hip trunk is nice and tall

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.780 
behind the hip trunk is nice and tall
hips<00:03:37.629> are<00:03:37.840> square<00:03:37.979> pointing<00:03:38.979> forward<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.609> nice

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
hips are square pointing forward so nice

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.089 
hips are square pointing forward so nice
and<00:03:40.000> neutral<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:41.019> with<00:03:41.229> that<00:03:41.409> front<00:03:41.709> leg<00:03:41.919> what

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
and neutral so with that front leg what

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.219 
and neutral so with that front leg what
we're<00:03:42.220> looking<00:03:42.489> at<00:03:42.609> here<00:03:42.669> also<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.569> we<00:03:43.959> want

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
we're looking at here also is we want

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.920 
we're looking at here also is we want
that<00:03:44.470> toe<00:03:44.799> pretty<00:03:45.250> much<00:03:45.519> pointing<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.239> not

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
that toe pretty much pointing if not

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.860 
that toe pretty much pointing if not
straight<00:03:47.409> on<00:03:47.590> also<00:03:47.949> a<00:03:48.849> little<00:03:49.299> bit<00:03:49.389> in<00:03:49.569> and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
straight on also a little bit in and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.869 
straight on also a little bit in and
again<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.680> bit<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:51.069> creates<00:03:51.819> a

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
again that little bit in creates a

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.879 
again that little bit in creates a
little<00:03:52.000> stability<00:03:52.269> in<00:03:52.689> the<00:03:52.810> hip<00:03:52.989> for<00:03:53.199> him<00:03:53.229> but

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
little stability in the hip for him but

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.189 
little stability in the hip for him but
it<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.220> not<00:03:54.430> necessary<00:03:55.269> if<00:03:55.509> you<00:03:55.659> have<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.049> go

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
it is not necessary if you have to go

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.349 
it is not necessary if you have to go
hunting<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:57.159> right<00:03:57.549> your<00:03:57.759> foot<00:03:58.000> should<00:03:58.180> go

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
hunting for it right your foot should go

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.719 
hunting for it right your foot should go
there<00:03:58.599> pretty<00:03:58.870> much<00:03:58.959> automatically<00:03:59.680> again<00:04:00.579> we

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
there pretty much automatically again we

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.189 
there pretty much automatically again we
don't<00:04:00.849> want<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.150> see<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.389> foot<00:04:01.599> turnout<00:04:01.959> if

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
don't want to see that foot turnout if

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.349 
don't want to see that foot turnout if
we<00:04:02.409> see<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.680> foot<00:04:02.859> turnout<00:04:03.219> exposes<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.180> hip

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
we see that foot turnout exposes the hip

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.119 
we see that foot turnout exposes the hip
to<00:04:04.479> the<00:04:04.569> rotation<00:04:05.139> and<00:04:05.349> we<00:04:05.439> don't<00:04:05.709> want<00:04:05.949> any

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
to the rotation and we don't want any

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.770 
to the rotation and we don't want any
rotation<00:04:06.549> happening<00:04:07.090> underneath<00:04:07.299> that<00:04:07.569> bar

underneath that barbell it causes him to

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.420 
underneath that barbell it causes him to

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
have to shift that entire system and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.760 
have to shift that entire system and
walk<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.760> forward<00:04:46.030> right<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.560> is

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
walk it forward right so this is

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.070 
walk it forward right so this is
Brandon's<00:04:48.280> receiving<00:04:49.060> position<00:04:49.510> now<00:04:50.020> the

mimic<00:04:56.380> his<00:04:56.920> squat<00:04:57.760> with<00:04:58.240> right<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.900> we're

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
mimic his squat with right so we're

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.080 
mimic his squat with right so we're
looking<00:04:59.080> at<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.530> width<00:04:59.860> that's<00:05:00.340> about<00:05:00.640> shoulder

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
looking at a width that's about shoulder

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.460 
looking at a width that's about shoulder
width<00:05:01.240> apart<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.690> that's<00:05:01.810> exactly<00:05:02.110> where

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
width apart and that's exactly where

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.560 
width apart and that's exactly where
Brandon<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:02.950> right<00:05:03.220> now<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.880> don't<00:05:04.060> want<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.420> to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
Brandon is right now we don't want it to

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.720 
Brandon is right now we don't want it to
narrow<00:05:04.870> we<00:05:05.140> call<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.530> walk<00:05:06.040> in<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.280> tightrope

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
narrow we call that walk in a tightrope

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.550 
narrow we call that walk in a tightrope
we<00:05:07.000> don't<00:05:07.240> want<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.510> feet<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.750> start<00:05:08.080> crossing

we don't want the feet to start crossing

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.590 
we don't want the feet to start crossing
lanes<00:05:08.800> because<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.400> loses<00:05:09.880> again<00:05:10.150> that

lanes because that loses again that

lanes because that loses again that
lateral<00:05:10.960> stability<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:12.550> we<00:05:12.670> don't<00:05:12.880> want<00:05:13.090> it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
lateral stability and we don't want it

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.820 
lateral stability and we don't want it
to<00:05:13.270> go<00:05:13.420> too<00:05:13.480> far<00:05:13.870> because<00:05:14.170> that's<00:05:14.590> going<00:05:14.770> to

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
to go too far because that's going to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.950 
to go too far because that's going to
keep<00:05:15.070> them<00:05:15.220> airborne<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.760> little<00:05:16.000> too<00:05:16.150> long<00:05:16.390> so

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
keep them airborne a little too long so

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.660 
keep them airborne a little too long so
from<00:05:17.170> here<00:05:17.440> what<00:05:17.620> I'm<00:05:17.710> going<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.890> simply<00:05:18.220> do<00:05:18.430> is

back knee will go all the way through to
kiss<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.510> floor<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.050> then<00:05:53.440> he'll<00:05:53.650> come<00:05:53.860> tall

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
kiss the floor and then he'll come tall

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.130 
kiss the floor and then he'll come tall
to<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.430> top<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.730> his<00:05:54.820> range<00:05:55.120> back<00:05:55.720> down<00:05:55.960> to

to the top of his range back down to

now<00:05:58.930> this<00:05:59.290> is<00:05:59.500> not<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.490> will<00:06:00.640> not<00:06:00.910> be<00:06:01.210> taking

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
now this is not you will not be taking

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.730 
now this is not you will not be taking
that<00:06:01.660> knee<00:06:01.840> all<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:02.110> way<00:06:02.260> down<00:06:02.500> before

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
that knee all the way down before

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.090 
that knee all the way down before
ideally<00:06:03.520> in<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:03.730> lunge<00:06:04.080> it's<00:06:05.080> weak<00:06:05.800> it's

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
ideally in the lunge it's weak it's

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.580 
ideally in the lunge it's weak it's
unstable<00:06:06.669> it's<00:06:07.210> unnecessary<00:06:08.110> in<00:06:08.350> most

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
unstable it's unnecessary in most

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.700 
unstable it's unnecessary in most
situations<00:06:09.030> but<00:06:10.030> as<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.330> beginner<00:06:10.900> it'll<00:06:11.590> be

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
situations but as a beginner it'll be

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.470 
situations but as a beginner it'll be
good<00:06:11.980> for<00:06:12.010> you<00:06:12.340> to<00:06:12.430> be<00:06:12.550> able<00:06:12.640> to<00:06:12.760> feel<00:06:13.150> what<00:06:13.180> it

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
good for you to be able to feel what it

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.300 
good for you to be able to feel what it
feels<00:06:13.660> like<00:06:13.930> so<00:06:14.140> you<00:06:14.200> have<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.710> option<00:06:15.190> or

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
feels like so you have the option or

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.460 
feels like so you have the option or
access<00:06:15.820> to<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.150> full<00:06:16.360> range<00:06:16.600> of<00:06:16.720> motion<00:06:16.870> right

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
access to a full range of motion right

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.290 
access to a full range of motion right
this<00:06:18.010> is<00:06:18.190> also<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.490> great<00:06:18.850> way<00:06:18.880> if<00:06:19.060> we're

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
this is also a great way if we're

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.340 
this is also a great way if we're
starting<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.690> look<00:06:19.840> at<00:06:19.930> some<00:06:20.110> strength

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
starting to look at some strength

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.900 
starting to look at some strength
training<00:06:20.500> components<00:06:21.160> for<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.700> start

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
training components for you to start

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.520 
training components for you to start
building<00:06:21.940> up<00:06:22.360> some<00:06:22.510> strength<00:06:22.870> through<00:06:23.320> that

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
building up some strength through that

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.040 
building up some strength through that
mid<00:06:24.010> range
