00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 apartment rooms or coffee set 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.020
 on the training stand pre 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.460
 installed resistant frame pitch 600 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.300

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 facing 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.330
 This step is not chosen by chance first 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.210
 achieved the necessary 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.650
 structural rigidity 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.030
 second to this step is a multiple of width 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.760

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.699
 conditions 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.179
 one of the most important operations 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.350
 providing high 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.330
 consumer properties of the coup 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.690
 at the company's factories courses when packing 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 products 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.140
 due to high strength and elasticity 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 fiberglass 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850
 under extruded thickness 6 times 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.409
 high elasticity 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.460
 provides 100 percent 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.499
 thickness regulations at 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:20.180
 unpacking 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.420
 in this way 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 course mat 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 saves space when 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.630
 transportation and storage 6 times for every 10 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.320

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.649
 purchasing material 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.479
 buyer enough accurately 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.169
 know the thickness and quantity 

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:37.580
 square meters coup 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.450
 different amounts of insulation in different 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 brand cars allows you to purchase 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.630
 the required amount of material is not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.390
 overpaying for extra volume 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.600
 The form of circulation of the course mats allows 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.979
 fill all isolated

 centimeters more step frame racks 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 possessing excellent flexibility and resilience 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.730
 mats fills isolated 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.850
