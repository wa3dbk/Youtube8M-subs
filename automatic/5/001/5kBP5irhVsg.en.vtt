as brown extensions go this is a cold

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.330

one<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> surefire

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
one I like the surefire

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.800 
one I like the surefire
attention<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:20.709> don't<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:21.550> not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
attention but I just don't know it's not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.080 
attention but I just don't know it's not
usable<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:22.840> me<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.260> cqb<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.640> looks<00:02:24.879> back

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
usable for me in cqb and the looks back

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.580 
usable for me in cqb and the looks back
there<00:02:25.269> wouldn't<00:02:25.599> be<00:02:25.660> worth<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.050> for<00:02:26.230> me<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.440> get

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
there wouldn't be worth it for me to get

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.009 
there wouldn't be worth it for me to get
one<00:02:26.769> well<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> personally<00:02:27.879> think<00:02:28.390> Tim's<00:02:28.629> pulled

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
one well I personally think Tim's pulled

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.690 
one well I personally think Tim's pulled
it<00:02:29.170> because<00:02:29.290> I've<00:02:29.739> used<00:02:30.010> barrel<00:02:30.519> extension

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it because I've used barrel extension

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.210 
it because I've used barrel extension
the<00:02:31.030> cqb<00:02:31.450> for<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> long<00:02:31.959> time<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.830> think<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the cqb for a long time now I think the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.559 
the cqb for a long time now I think the
only<00:02:33.310> thing<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:33.700> agree<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.330> when

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
only thing we can agree on is that when

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.759 
only thing we can agree on is that when
we<00:02:34.690> use<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.110> lot<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.379> times<00:02:35.470> we're

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
we use these a lot of times we're

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.619 
we use these a lot of times we're
banging<00:02:35.980> into<00:02:36.250> walls<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:37.030> know<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.330> really

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
banging into walls you know it really

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.509 
banging into walls you know it really
you<00:02:38.290> could<00:02:38.560> break<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> barrel<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.400> gun

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
you could break the barrel in the gun

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.250 
you could break the barrel in the gun
but<00:02:39.790> honestly<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.690> love<00:02:40.840> playing<00:02:40.959> them

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.800 
and I actually didn't even start to buy
a<00:02:45.220> barrel<00:02:45.489> extension<00:02:45.640> until<00:02:46.090> after<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.569> saw

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810

length<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.530> barrel<00:04:11.799> you<00:04:12.519> will<00:04:12.730> need<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> barrel

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
length of barrel you will need a barrel

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.839 
length of barrel you will need a barrel
extension<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:14.349> cover<00:04:14.650> up<00:04:14.919> your<00:04:15.310> inner<00:04:15.519> barrel

can't take off the Bradley Center so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.190 
can't take off the Bradley Center so

no I think you're forgetting like these
chaotic<00:04:24.669> kwa<00:04:25.539> guns<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.020> just<00:04:26.169> pull<00:04:26.349> out<00:04:26.380> the

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
chaotic kwa guns you just pull out the

chaotic kwa guns you just pull out the
pins

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
pins

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.680 
pins
open<00:04:27.430> at<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.580> top<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:28.150> take<00:04:28.300> out<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.479> barrel

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
open at the top you take out the barrel

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.510 
open at the top you take out the barrel
so<00:04:28.840> quick<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.169> takes

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
so quick it takes

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520 
so quick it takes

two minutes he was in between games take

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.890 
two minutes he was in between games take

there play with an outdoor gun that's
pretty<00:04:38.099> awesome<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.729> mean<00:04:39.090> especially<00:04:39.479> me

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
pretty awesome I mean especially me

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350 
pretty awesome I mean especially me
think<00:04:39.990> I'm<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.259> these<00:04:40.409> are<00:04:40.470> $90<00:04:41.099> maybe<00:04:41.400> $85

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
think I'm like these are $90 maybe $85

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.670 
think I'm like these are $90 maybe $85
that's<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.840> lot<00:04:42.990> cheaper<00:04:43.169> than<00:04:43.289> having<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.590> buy

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
that's a lot cheaper than having to buy

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.610 
that's a lot cheaper than having to buy
a<00:04:43.710> whole<00:04:43.800> new<00:04:44.220> field<00:04:44.520> gun<00:04:45.050> indeed<00:04:46.050> especially

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
a whole new field gun indeed especially

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.080 
a whole new field gun indeed especially
if<00:04:46.889> you<00:04:46.949> calculate<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.430> cost<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.849> an<00:04:47.940> inner

if you calculate the cost of an inner

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
barrel under the hop-up unit so they

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.860
