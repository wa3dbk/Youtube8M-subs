00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everybody, my name is daniel below am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.480
 of salvador bahia and only an entrepreneur 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.069
 I'm here today to tell 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.840
 the history of my company to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.790
 dengue or brigadeiro that was founded there 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.290
 two years I started the avenue 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.940
 brigadeiro at work 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.859
 actually a little before i started 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.779
 selling passion fruit music 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.369
 only it did not work out then one of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.750
 I was asked by one of my colleagues 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.910
 work and asked to take 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 brigadeiro brigadeiro 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.930
 everyone liked and then I started to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.080
 diversify sometimes brigadiers 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.940
 little kisses until a certain day 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 Another colleague sees me problem 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 foot did not know that he had no knowledge 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 about this candy 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 so I got home at night to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.860
 to research the recipe or to know the origin of the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.140
 sweet because the name of this sweet 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.300
 Anyway, that's when I came across 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 several jokes that already exist in sÃ£o 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 Paulo in the river and I did not know because in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 savior did not yet exist 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.079
 finds it a great opportunity 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.580
 because I thought of being a pioneer in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.830
 my city in this branch and I started 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 studies in this area. 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.330
 segment seeks flavors and packaging as 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.790
 is really delve into and out of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.439
 day is a novelty at work it took 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.229
 fantasist the co- workers of 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.840
 guinea pigs took the brigadeiros to them 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.790
 to try it was fine if it was not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 on my weekends it was 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 practically doing this and god for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.880
 power is perfected and there is a day 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 with another colleague said 'if nothing nor 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 there is dany banana from luciano huck 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.170
 So you owe the brigadeiro and then 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 Surname was everyone in my work 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 He called me Brigadier of Brigitte and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 so I decided to put the name of the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 company dan brigadeiro and I was selling to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 the colleagues in my work and also 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 sold to colleagues from other companies 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 who worked in the middle in the building after 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 of a certain time like I was 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 perfecting I started to sell too 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.649
 for politicians the company for which I 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.610
 worked as he worked in the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.590
 attendance 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.629
 I used to put a play pot 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.360
 at the counter and sometimes the customer I 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.330
 I attended 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.080
 vineyard that was brigadier and prevented and 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.570
 such 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.220
 often the customers of the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.330
 company also passed their 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 customers 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.640
 with that the sales began to grow 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.490
 orders started to grow at 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.380
 word of mouth really 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.200
 worked mainly at this moment 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.020
 which until then had not been late in the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.610
 facebook did not advertise was 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.709
 really is word of mouth until the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.530
 moment that December arrived was a 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.959
 moment I can say yes crucial because 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:56.680
 was a good time for this wine to 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.690
 I end of year 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.750
 everybody wants a treat a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.780
 different gift then 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.780
 several orders because I worked 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.780
 16 to 19 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:25.420
 and then the work comes too and I started to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.420
 have the disability because I was not 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.130
 giving is the best of me for none of the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.180
 two 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:38.200
 I decided to stay at work or I 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.880
 Danni brigadeiro invested a little 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 difficult because it was newly formed and 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.360
 Nice job, did not work with me. 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.870
 I was free not working at the time of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.390
 christmas party and new year joÃ£o carnaval 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.239
 all these pieces also the team of 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.030
 slack and thus drop all this to 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.610
 to work practically from Sunday to 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.799
 Sunday in something uncertain because even 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.760
 so I did not know a hoe right 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.350
 or not, and doing politics will be 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.140
 really worth it 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.329
 And then I decided to talk to my 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.000
 Mom, she supported me, my friends too. 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.280
 everybody supported and I decided then I left 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.440
 I quit my job and play 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.180
 my life as an entrepreneur because it was 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.690
 one thing I would like is one thing 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.420
 that I like to do 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.670
 It really is such a wonderful thing. 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.160
 only who is entrepreneur even for power 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.620
 understand people sometimes work 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.110
 a lot more sure works a lot 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.050
 more than if he had a fixed job but 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.140
 French is different from the taste of 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.590
 I work differently but I leave the 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:53.450
 work I touched I went deeper still 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.790
 more branches this Stephano brigadiers and 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.640
 That's when I created a team. 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.350
 I set up a space to apply the 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.850
 brigadeiros that until then was in the kitchen 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:10.700
 from home and I was touching today thanks to 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.830
 God meets us to be weddings 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.120
 quite a company also in the sector 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.510
 corporate we already make friends with 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.230
 the artists have already come out with the media 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.240

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.900

 will it be in the neighborhood but it 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.290
