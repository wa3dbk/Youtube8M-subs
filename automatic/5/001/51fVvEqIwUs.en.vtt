00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.309
 I attack people who are talking 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.489
 matheus and today I'll explain to 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.609
 Something much but as has 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.649
 people almost killing what it's like updating 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.989
 for windows 10 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.019
 If you have already opened the folder, it means if 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.920
 You already opened neo ndÃ³ amb date and gave 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.739
 error 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.170
 if you have already deleted folders gave error 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.659
 also if you have already made the Mandingas 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.909
 life and made a mistake so well 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.649
 Rest assured that now you're going to give 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.319
 sure but you must be wondering 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.100
 the Amadeus as you know will give 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.409
 right 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.299
 Good, I say it will work out because 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.250
 How can you be perceiving I play? 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.850
 in 10,000 men also had this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.950
 of the mandingas of the expensive and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.570
 a new method worked out analyzed without 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 no problem 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.340
 then enough of the coil and let's go to the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.109
 culture to the first thing you have 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.179
 to do is to open run windows 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.659
 so that's why you press the key 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.009
 windows but re enter the key 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.950
 the following command that will appear in a 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.659
 video for you see this command you 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.619
 type in your run and give an ok 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.289
 after that he may ask for a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.439
 permission to open the registry editor 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.149
 click yes and now comes the one part 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.390
 little more annoying than paying 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.009
 Please note that the registration key is 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.119
 We'll have to navigate this 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.700
 pastes 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.340
 so be careful not to get 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 lost the first easter we go 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.179
 search for is here local machine search 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.210
 she opens later we'll search 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.440
 the software folder found him opening it 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.349
 also 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.690
 now we are going to the microsoft folder 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.710
 I think she appeals too 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.300
 now we are going to look for windows folder 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.420
 will probably be one of the last 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.670
 I think she's beautiful too and now we 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 go to the rock point folder 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.700
 I think it's over and now we're going 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.550
 just look for the windows since she think 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.330
 to ap too and now we will look for 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.100
 the last folder that is the sr break 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.060
 in which case mine will be different from 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.280
 its not so if there's the goal there 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.620
 different is because the different half 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.870
 because the restaurant or going to 10 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.260
 so he ended up deleting this folder but 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 I have here fast for effects on 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.920
 tutorial 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.930
 so come on you click on the folder is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.730
 always large and comes in this window that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.800
 today has data type name 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.410
 and then with the right mouse button you 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:15.760
 click comes new and comes value of 8 32 bits 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.540
 remembering 32 bits and there like the name of that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.030
 value 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.920
 You will enter the name that will appear 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 now in the video for you too that the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:31.810
 album the great typing it you 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.739
 will do click on it and with the button 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.510
 right-click you'll modify the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.760
 name of the value you leave that just 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.390
 edit care of the value you go by 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.670
 me if you have so you change to an ea 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.950
 base you will keep as hexadecimal 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.140
 After that, you give me an okay 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.290
 if you pay attention you realize 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.660
 that the data here of the value has changed 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.140
 He has to stay that way later. 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.980
 you can find registry editor 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.370
 and now you open te windows update on 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.590
 In case I have leather on the 10, he's open. 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.440
 neither with 11 upgrades to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.260
 do but finally if you open windows 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.280
 update and update again from this 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.200
 available sure for all the guy you 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.600
 you can now install the goal update 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.610
 10 because it will work out as it happened 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.469
 This was direct already. 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.180

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.349
 And this one for you did not know 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.060
 quiet that still has a few more 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.379
 steps to be taken 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.580
 so if it 's for you it did not work 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:43.370
 minimizes salt your windows update april 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.110

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.289
 involves running with tightening windows 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.439

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.509
 You'll leave it quietly there. 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.580

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.439
 updates at the time you click and 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.990

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.159

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.580
 updates with this command you will 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.860
 force him to find the selection but at 10 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.779
 and he will tell you the clothes that have a 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.370

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.529
 there you see whether you want to install or not 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.210
 I'm sure I also decided to 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.009

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.839

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.460
