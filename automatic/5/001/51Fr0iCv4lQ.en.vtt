00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.310
 and my crazy buttons from Brazil 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.540
 All right, Rafael. Look at the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.220
 What are we going to do today? 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.250
 It matters a thing to you, you know. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.770
 making an omelet of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.990
 hamptons or better known as omelet 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.440
 Let's say crunching and showing 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.830
 the ingredients as good as 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.350
 that 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.809
 crunchy omelet a legion of ten 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 barbecue song albums that the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.810
 marketing is it does not respect the turkey 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.489
 with cheese and milk either in their role of 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.489
 male I will not break 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.640
 I may not have attended caused a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.850
 Brazilian frying pan let's bring it to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.009
 lining and start making our net this is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 fundamentally the basis of our 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.050
 fear is that part of bat beats well 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 the more you hit the more homogeneous 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.729
 get margarine a little margarine 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 moral person is just to get wet 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.119
 little hard tone rather serves height 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.720
 tool and has in his mother's house his 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 armchair 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.170
 You'll use it to make a brief one. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 did a doctor because you will learn to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 Now do you ever made an omelet is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 almost equal to know about this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.270
 program with great future the differential 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 It's already done that it's not done. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 come in here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.900
 already together with her 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.420
 the margarine or the shooting if the egg already 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.509
 and put it on the three docks 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 The canopy of the campfires is as follows: 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.369
 move anything passes and turning 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 slowly in the frying pan 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.829
 the egg rotates rotates rotates rotates rotates 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.509
 to form a pancake 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.420
 now leave some time until this part 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.099
 do not stay the thing let's start with what 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 we bought the bank a tray of 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.880
 200 grams mozzarella cheese place the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 cheese 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.319
 we will put all the tracks 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.819
 media make here a well- pressed omelette 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.580
 put it here you give that last one no 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.200
 I'll give it already leaves a little lower than 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 We do not want to burn our improvement. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.690
 Even now we go to the tomato for the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 tomato was when they put tomatoes still 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 we will not lay the branches because you 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.650
 want to make a provocative omelet 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.030
 lawyer does not go limp if that is not 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.590
 that she shows that she's crunchy will 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.330
 wait a little bit and our 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.640
 belletti will have the look a look 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.930
 that he was the one of hunger with 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 turkey breast and cheese 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.590
 so the situation deserves reflection 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.480
 stay just want her to also go to 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.959
 follows the brazilian environment for 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.410
 school 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.820
 come on now with a good barbecue 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.620
 People prefer a barbecue because they do not 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.420
 I think it's more tasty next time 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.730
 but if you want to do with the thinker 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.640
 choice then the body begins to put the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 your lover is a pack of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 the one that serves only for a 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.000
 person is also going to make you a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.890
 very provocative noise is we were one 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.109
 package of cash without voice and will prove 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.560
 the best thing in your life that comes and goes 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.870
 Doubling it here made this here is more 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.180
 known 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.880
 copel to this here is very similar 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.970
 with the taco bell tattoo tacos food 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.079
 to pour if you want to go 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.079
 Remember very well. 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.269
 now you can see that the dough is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.250
 golden until the gap was not too 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.560
 time here so it did not get soft 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.140
 the dollar is on point the cheese melt 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.360
 uac a little for you to take the following 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.010
 now for the sauce is very simple to take 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.510
 a cup of your instant soup 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.510
 instant turkey breast with cheese 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.660
 now put half a glass of milk 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.960
 Very well, let's take this mix a lot. 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.269
 crazy to the microwave a minute 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.190
 Let's play a little bit. 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:26.350
 the little hands stirred ok ok ok ok 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.250
 Let's put it on top of our oleds 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.250
 the neneca 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:41.069
 you can see that in the chest arms of 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:41.069
 turkey and that's it look the time to cry 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.700
 feelings of better luck in the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.700
 moral is one more piece 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.140
 just got that a lot of our class I 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:20.230
 I do not think anybody told the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:29.860
 companions but whose task is to maintain the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:31.950
 also end up here in the 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.950
 second
