00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.039
 I do not know what to say in Florida 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.999
 three minutes 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.999
 for the greatest battle of our professional lives 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 everything is reduced 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.649
 the loans 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.529
 as a team 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.620
 another three per hour 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.670
 I can not do it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.500
 the others 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.829
 as soon as you become more employable and with your designs 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.650
 the concessions that's part of the girl 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.520
 but just talk about sex 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.650
 when you start losing those things 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.660
 you discover that life in three mundane issues 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330
 but this is soccer 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 because in every game 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.540
 delmar people 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.570
 it's very small half a second slower faster end ollé 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.740
 his wife the second second slowest fastest if you do not get to fuck in 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 this team we fight for that terrain 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.900
 this team we leave the skin ourselves in each of the others for 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
 that juan cabandié pointed 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 because when we form one great after another 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 hopefully if we add these days that is what marks the end of a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 difference 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 with regard to led light 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.900
 the night 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 death is this for that terrain 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 is that eta say the foot 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.600
 it's because they still have a lot and die for that arm wrestling 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.130
 because in my life 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.810
 consists of that im 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740
 I can not understand the gays 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.999
 exceptional character that you have by your side look him in the eye 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.169
