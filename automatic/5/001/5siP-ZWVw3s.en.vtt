00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
to see it on the on the mouth that's how

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.610 
to see it on the on the mouth that's how
bright<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.590> would<00:03:59.680> have<00:03:59.799> been<00:03:59.919> on<00:04:00.209> my<00:04:01.209> eye<00:04:01.620> but

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
bright it would have been on my eye but

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.710 
bright it would have been on my eye but
I<00:04:02.680> don't<00:04:02.859> really<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.099> a<00:04:03.489> chance<00:04:04.359> to<00:04:04.540> properly

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720

suppose this is a good chance to show

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.460 
suppose this is a good chance to show
you<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.180> if<00:05:09.449> if<00:05:09.720> they<00:05:09.840> don't<00:05:10.020> come<00:05:10.110> clean<00:05:10.320> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
you that if if they don't come clean the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.010 
you that if if they don't come clean the
first<00:05:10.650> time<00:05:10.919> just<00:05:11.610> each<00:05:11.790> time<00:05:12.060> do<00:05:12.180> just<00:05:12.630> do

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
first time just each time do just do

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.080 
first time just each time do just do
need<00:05:13.260> just<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.860> drop<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.419> liquid<00:05:15.419> each<00:05:15.630> time

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
need just a drop of liquid each time

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.129 
need just a drop of liquid each time
we're<00:05:18.090> getting<00:05:18.240> less<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.449> less<00:05:18.660> of<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:19.919> now

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.330 

so<00:05:25.139> if<00:05:25.199> you<00:05:25.260> think<00:05:25.290> about<00:05:25.500> using<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.979> drop<00:05:26.190> each

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
so if you think about using a drop each

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.240 
so if you think about using a drop each
time<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.940> good<00:05:27.449> clean<00:05:27.900> don't<00:05:28.590> even<00:05:29.040> see<00:05:29.220> it

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
time that good clean don't even see it
