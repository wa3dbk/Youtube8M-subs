what<00:00:15.150> did<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.360> touch<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:16.020> bit<00:00:16.230> with

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
what did you touch on a little bit with

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
what did you touch on a little bit with
the<00:00:17.369> skiing<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.779> show

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the skiing of what we have here to show

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890 
the skiing of what we have here to show
today<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.830> far<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:20.789> ski<00:00:21.090> set<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
today as far as actually ski set up and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.510 
today as far as actually ski set up and
a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.140> bit<00:00:22.259> on<00:00:22.349> the<00:00:22.529> ski<00:00:22.770> design<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> our

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
a little bit on the ski design and our

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.499 
a little bit on the ski design and our
philosophy<00:00:23.930> for<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.110> ski<00:00:25.320> design<00:00:26.509> basically

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
philosophy for the ski design basically

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.990 
philosophy for the ski design basically
what<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> good<00:00:28.050> show<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.460> same<00:00:29.699> shot

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
what a good show here is the same shot

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.380 
what a good show here is the same shot
on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> left<00:00:30.660> side<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.619> 28<00:00:32.250> off<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
on the left side we have 28 off on the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.960 
on the left side we have 28 off on the
right<00:00:33.540> side<00:00:33.809> we've<00:00:34.080> got<00:00:34.110> 38<00:00:34.739> off<00:00:34.949> but<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> want

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
right side we've got 38 off but I want

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.390 
right side we've got 38 off but I want
to<00:00:36.090> show<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.350> path<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:38.129> take

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
to show what a different path we take

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.799 
to show what a different path we take
into<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.879> buoy<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.570> between<00:00:40.140> 28<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.650> 38<00:00:41.400> off

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
into the buoy at between 28 and 38 off

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.860 
into the buoy at between 28 and 38 off
now<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.080> really<00:00:43.470> interested<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
now what I really interested in here is

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
now what I really interested in here is
this<00:00:45.870> path<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.470> here<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.549> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this path right here where we see this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
this path right here where we see this
line<00:00:48.150> this<00:00:48.659> is<00:00:48.720> 38<00:00:49.229> off<00:00:49.670> get<00:00:50.670> much<00:00:50.970> straighter

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
line this is 38 off get much straighter

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.590 
line this is 38 off get much straighter
here<00:00:51.809> than<00:00:52.650> what<00:00:52.799> we<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.220> at<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.610> 28<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.180> coming

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
here than what we see at a 28 off coming

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.420 
here than what we see at a 28 off coming
through<00:00:54.839> here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.109 

but<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.519> we<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.879> come

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
but if we take this back and we come

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.080 
but if we take this back and we come
right<00:01:03.360> off<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.690> wakes<00:01:03.900> right<00:01:04.820> off<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> edge

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
right off the wakes right off the edge

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.560 
right off the wakes right off the edge
change<00:01:06.540> we're<00:01:07.080> coming<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.740> change

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
change we're coming off the edge change

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.469 
change we're coming off the edge change
very<00:01:09.570> similar<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.470> similar<00:01:10.560> place<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
very similar very similar place and this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
very similar very similar place and this
is<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:14.070> skiing<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> was

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
is a lot of what in my skiing when I was

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
is a lot of what in my skiing when I was
competing<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.380> setting<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.799> skis

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
competing and when I was setting up skis

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179 
competing and when I was setting up skis
was<00:01:18.149> I<00:01:18.420> wanted<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.140> able<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.829> ski

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
was I wanted to be able to have my ski

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.010 
was I wanted to be able to have my ski
and<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:20.549> sure<00:01:20.789> that<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.179> was<00:01:21.359> able<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> carry

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and make sure that I was able to carry

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.889 
and make sure that I was able to carry
my<00:01:22.259> momentum<00:01:22.799> carry<00:01:23.609> it<00:01:23.789> here<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.359> sometimes

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
my momentum carry it here so sometimes

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.560 
my momentum carry it here so sometimes
my<00:01:25.890> setup<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.429> a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.820> harder<00:01:27.179> to<00:01:27.329> ski

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
my setup was a little bit harder to ski

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.530 
my setup was a little bit harder to ski
at<00:01:27.810> 28<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.310> 38<00:01:29.700> off

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.300 

but<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.780> run<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:39.680> we<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> much

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
but as we run this here we see a much

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.920 
but as we run this here we see a much
straighter<00:01:41.730> line<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.660> we're<00:01:42.810> actually

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
straighter line here so we're actually

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.170 
straighter line here so we're actually
having<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.560> come<00:01:43.740> across<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.730> get<00:01:44.850> angle

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
having to come across here we get angle

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.590 
having to come across here we get angle
through<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> gates<00:01:46.010> pretty<00:01:47.010> much<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> same

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
through the gates pretty much the same

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.850 
through the gates pretty much the same
same<00:01:48.600> angle<00:01:48.930> through<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> gauge<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.710> much

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
same angle through the gauge pretty much

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460 
same angle through the gauge pretty much
the<00:01:49.980> same<00:01:50.160> hang<00:01:50.430> edge<00:01:50.730> change<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.110> because

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the same hang edge change but because

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
the same hang edge change but because
we're<00:01:52.680> further<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> side<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.820> boat

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
we're further up on the side of the boat

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
we're further up on the side of the boat
obviously<00:01:54.510> traveling<00:01:54.870> much<00:01:55.020> faster<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:56.070> need

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
obviously traveling much faster we need

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
obviously traveling much faster we need
to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.580> able<00:01:56.730> to<00:01:56.820> keep<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.330> much<00:01:57.630> momentum<00:01:58.290> into

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to be able to keep as much momentum into

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.340 
to be able to keep as much momentum into
this<00:01:58.710> turn<00:01:59.010> as<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.670> possibly<00:02:00.120> can<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.720> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
this turn as we possibly can so that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.040 
this turn as we possibly can so that
when<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> finish<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.340> turn<00:02:02.580> we<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.720> end<00:02:03.900> up

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
when we finish the turn we can end up

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.160 
when we finish the turn we can end up
with<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.350> same<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:05.430> similar<00:02:05.730> rotation<00:02:06.660> as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
with the same very similar rotation as

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
with the same very similar rotation as
what<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:08.610> 28<00:02:08.970> off<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.270> 38<00:02:09.570> off<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.640> if

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
what we would at 28 off or 38 off but if

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
what we would at 28 off or 38 off but if
I<00:02:11.940> set<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> ski<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.220> able<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.610> try<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I set the ski up to be able to try to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.730 
I set the ski up to be able to try to
create<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.990> same<00:02:17.750> 28<00:02:18.750> off<00:02:18.930> arc<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:20.010> 38<00:02:20.700> off<00:02:20.910> I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
create the same 28 off arc at 38 off I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.980 
create the same 28 off arc at 38 off I
would<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.540> sudden<00:02:24.570> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
would be out here and all of a sudden I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.540 
would be out here and all of a sudden I
would<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> lot<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.590> my<00:02:25.860> ski<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> water

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
would have a lot of my ski in the water

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.340 
would have a lot of my ski in the water
which<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> lot<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> skiers<00:02:27.840> try<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.110> do

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
which I see a lot of skiers try to do

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.050 
which I see a lot of skiers try to do
they<00:02:28.590> try<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.830> get<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> lot<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.520> their<00:02:29.700> ski<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
they try to get a lot of their ski in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.670 
they try to get a lot of their ski in
the<00:02:30.090> water<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.690> point<00:02:30.780> feeling<00:02:31.500> like

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the water at this point feeling like

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
the water at this point feeling like
that's<00:02:32.340> slowing<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.330> deceleration

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's slowing down that's deceleration

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.880 
that's slowing down that's deceleration
which<00:02:34.440> yes<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> trouble<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
which yes it is but the trouble is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.960 
which yes it is but the trouble is
you've<00:02:37.890> still<00:02:38.190> got<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> long<00:02:38.580> ways<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.940> go

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you've still got a long ways to go

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.610 
you've still got a long ways to go
before<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.600> reach<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.810> buoy<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.470> you're

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
before you reach the buoy so if you're

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620 
before you reach the buoy so if you're
decelerating<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.209> ski<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
decelerating with a lot of ski and the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.800 
decelerating with a lot of ski and the
water<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.940> you're<00:02:44.940> gonna<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.239> an<00:02:45.300> awfully

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
water here you're gonna have an awfully

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.260 
water here you're gonna have an awfully
tight<00:02:46.080> line<00:02:46.430> by<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.459> time<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.880> get<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
tight line by the time you get to the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.090 
tight line by the time you get to the
finish<00:02:48.600> which<00:02:48.780> makes<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.200> very<00:02:49.590> hard<00:02:49.709> to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
finish which makes it very very hard to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.850 
finish which makes it very very hard to
rotate<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.600> get<00:02:51.780> rotated<00:02:52.350> at<00:02:52.440> 38

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
rotate and if you do get rotated at 38

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.160 
rotate and if you do get rotated at 38
you've<00:02:53.430> killed<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:53.880> your<00:02:53.940> momentum<00:02:54.300> which

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you've killed all your momentum which

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.050 
you've killed all your momentum which
means<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:56.280> into<00:02:56.430> two<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.790> three

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
means probably going into two and three

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.660 
means probably going into two and three
you're<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.959> carry<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.380> lot<00:02:58.680> extra<00:02:59.010> velocity

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you're gonna carry a lot extra velocity

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.660 
you're gonna carry a lot extra velocity
and<00:02:59.790> speed<00:02:59.910> than<00:03:00.330> what<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:00.780> need<00:03:01.670> but

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and speed than what you really need but

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.320 
and speed than what you really need but
going<00:03:02.880> back<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.650> where<00:03:05.120> we<00:03:06.120> come

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
going back to here this is where we come

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.229 
going back to here this is where we come
across<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:07.080> come<00:03:07.260> across<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.769> wake<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.370> you

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
across we come across the wake here you

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.729 
across we come across the wake here you
know<00:03:09.330> we<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> front<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> ski<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
know we get the front of the ski to

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.030 
know we get the front of the ski to
initiate<00:03:11.370> into<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> turn<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:13.500> then<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.830> want

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
initiate into the turn but then we want

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
initiate into the turn but then we want
it<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.310> kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.640> stay<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.930> somewhat<00:03:16.380> out

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it to kind of stay kind of somewhat out

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.130 
it to kind of stay kind of somewhat out
of<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.920> water<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.850> maintain<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
of the water so that we can maintain the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.830 
of the water so that we can maintain the
direction<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.800> maintain<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.550> run

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
direction we can maintain the run

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.810 
direction we can maintain the run
there's<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.930> lot<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.290> fin<00:03:22.560> setup<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:23.160> what<00:03:23.610> can

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
there's a lot of fin setup of what can

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:59.990 
there's a lot of fin setup of what can
happen<00:03:23.850> right<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.780> point

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.970 

if<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.209> had<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.569> picture<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.140> mind<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.830> what<00:04:02.860> I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
if I had this picture in mind of what I

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.910 
if I had this picture in mind of what I
wanted<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.520> do<00:04:03.640> at<00:04:03.760> 38<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:05.140> know<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.260> could<00:04:05.620> set

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
wanted to do at 38 you know I could set

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.610 
wanted to do at 38 you know I could set
up<00:04:06.100> my<00:04:06.310> ski<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.209> be<00:04:07.360> able<00:04:07.569> to<00:04:07.690> rotate<00:04:07.930> out<00:04:08.350> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
up my ski to be able to rotate out the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.559 
up my ski to be able to rotate out the
same<00:04:08.830> way<00:04:09.010> as<00:04:09.100> what<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:09.400> one<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.640> but<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
same way as what this one is but the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.809 
same way as what this one is but the
trouble<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.319> would<00:04:11.890> end<00:04:12.040> up<00:04:12.160> trying<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.610> end

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
trouble is I would end up trying to end

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.030 
trouble is I would end up trying to end
up<00:04:13.090> making<00:04:13.240> my<00:04:13.540> turn<00:04:13.780> sooner<00:04:14.410> before<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.860> buoy

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
up making my turn sooner before the buoy

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.039 
up making my turn sooner before the buoy
I<00:04:15.280> would<00:04:15.400> actually<00:04:15.730> rotate<00:04:16.180> inwards<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> ski

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
I would actually rotate inwards the ski

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.370 
I would actually rotate inwards the ski
would<00:04:17.260> come<00:04:17.500> back<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.850> center<00:04:19.329> line<00:04:19.359> too<00:04:19.930> early

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
would come back to center line too early

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.920 
would come back to center line too early
and<00:04:20.560> then<00:04:21.519> we<00:04:22.000> have<00:04:22.180> what<00:04:22.360> happens<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.780> like<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
and then we have what happens is like a

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.620 
and then we have what happens is like a
double<00:04:23.320> pump<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:24.310> have<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.550> come<00:04:24.760> back<00:04:24.910> up<00:04:25.150> we

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
double pump we have to come back up we

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.510 
double pump we have to come back up we
have<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.930> run<00:04:26.169> we've<00:04:26.530> lost<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.950> lot<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.250> momentum

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
have to run we've lost a lot of momentum

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.240 
have to run we've lost a lot of momentum
and<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.540> make<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> turn<00:04:29.320> which<00:04:29.650> might<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:30.010> really

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
and we make a turn which might be really

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.550 
and we make a turn which might be really
tight<00:04:30.490> but<00:04:31.270> we're<00:04:31.419> going<00:04:31.630> very<00:04:31.840> slow<00:04:32.140> if<00:04:32.380> we

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
tight but we're going very slow if we

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.590 
tight but we're going very slow if we
had<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.740> GPS<00:04:33.130> on<00:04:33.460> us<00:04:33.640> right<00:04:33.880> there<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.419> measure

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
had a GPS on us right there to measure

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.930 
had a GPS on us right there to measure
the<00:04:34.840> speed<00:04:35.080> if<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.710> double<00:04:35.919> pump<00:04:36.280> we're

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
the speed if we do a double pump we're

way at the longer line lengths where we

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.570 
way at the longer line lengths where we
start<00:05:31.390> we<00:05:31.720> take<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:31.930> look<00:05:32.200> at<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:33.220> we<00:05:33.400> take

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
start we take a look at that and we take

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.340 
start we take a look at that and we take
a<00:05:33.610> look<00:05:33.850> at<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.090> ski<00:05:34.300> setup<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.810> where<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.169> is

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
a look at the ski setup of where that is

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.590 
a look at the ski setup of where that is
and<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.560> lot<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.770> times<00:05:36.010> we<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.220> see<00:05:36.700> what's

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
and a lot of times we can see what's

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.540 
and a lot of times we can see what's
going<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.840> happen<00:05:38.229> here<00:05:38.620> what's<00:05:39.070> happening

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
going to happen here what's happening

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.240 
going to happen here what's happening
here<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.870> know<00:05:40.990> may<00:05:41.260> or<00:05:41.289> may<00:05:41.620> not<00:05:41.800> be<00:05:42.039> right

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
here you know may or may not be right

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.820 
here you know may or may not be right
here<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:42.940> we<00:05:43.090> take<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.690> two<00:05:43.930> in<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.229> mind<00:05:44.470> of

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
here so we take the two in the mind of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.980 
here so we take the two in the mind of
you<00:05:45.700> know<00:05:45.820> we<00:05:45.940> take<00:05:46.120> this<00:05:46.270> visual<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.870> the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
you know we take this visual of the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.680 
you know we take this visual of the
skier<00:05:47.350> to<00:05:47.530> start<00:05:48.039> with<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.490> then<00:05:49.330> where<00:05:49.570> we

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
skier to start with and then where we

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.240 
skier to start with and then where we
want<00:05:49.900> them<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.229> be<00:05:50.410> so<00:05:50.740> there's<00:05:51.010> some

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
want them to be so there's some

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.330 
want them to be so there's some
technical<00:05:52.240> changes<00:05:52.600> in<00:05:52.780> style<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.560> some

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
technical changes in style and some

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.000 
technical changes in style and some
course<00:05:54.640> management<00:05:55.120> but<00:05:56.050> this<00:05:56.350> this<00:05:56.680> really

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
course management but this this really

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.960 
course management but this this really
helps<00:05:57.340> us<00:05:57.520> on<00:05:57.960> setup<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.200> ski<00:05:59.530> you<00:05:59.860> know<00:06:00.490> ski
