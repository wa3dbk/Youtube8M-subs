00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.780
 yes 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 very nice people welcome back to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.230
 channel we're in a new video and we're going 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 let's see we are in the first chapter of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.669
 the map guide in this case we're going to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.169
 start by retweet is to say that it is one 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.369
 of my favorite maps is pretty 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.200
 colorful I think it's very good 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 structured as much as for public 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.160
 as for competitive games like this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.110
 that we are going to try, I would put in a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.600
 private with joseÃ­to I also just 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.520
 know and well I'll show you a little 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 the spots the tricks and the places where 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.170
 we can say dominate and have a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 broader view of the map good let's 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 start a bit let's say put this zone 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 that I do not really know the flags in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 some flag that what we do not have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.079
 this site here that many 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 we will know but many people do not know that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.560
 you can come here where we are 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 so if you go up here you have 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.890
 let's say a pretty broad control over 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 the map more if you jump you can control 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 the middle and even outside zhang the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 true is a good place for when 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.520
 start the game or some of that too 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.290
 it's fine then if we come here and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.990
 we jump here one thing that a lot of people 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 I did not know we can point here let's say 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 that we are covered and protected a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.789
 little twists and this gives us security 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.590
 but you have the advantage now then 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.299
 one thing that I realize investigating 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.789
 yesterday is that here the theme of trees 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.319
 that can go up let's say a little bit the branch 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.750
 and if you move a little bit even then 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.350
 get to see this great good surprise 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.450
 good 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.799
 I will not recommend it here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.050
 I have the pots that today is for 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.300
 make a girls and everything in Barranquilla 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.770
 and the truth that is very good then in 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.330
 the area east is a hot spot is what 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.310
 only that I know hot spot the truth 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 that does not have much room but if I had 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.220
 that choosing one of yours would put me 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.100
 here because the truth is that I protect very 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.010
 well the point from outside and from all 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 sides because this site is very good 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.270
 then going a bit to the middle of the 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.980
 mom let's see why I do not know if I lie 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.420
 we have the area is up here not 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.710
 it is highly recommended to get up here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.120
 Well, because a little bit of rest comes to you 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.370
 the other one, but good if you have 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.950
 some steel drawers, maybe you can 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.930
 hold a bug the voucher one of the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.350
 sites is that good as many people go 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.030
 best 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 most will know that you can go up 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.200
 here that's why we come from the highest 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.720
 here where it jumped you can put yourself in front 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.210
 and if you have a little here you have here 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.920
 several all the rest against what we say 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.510
 that seems without this response I'm going to whom 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 is dominated this answered the truth 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
 pretty good because you also control 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.500
 a little the middle and the back then here 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.850
 the flag must a pretty banner and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.450
 as it is difficult to catch since 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.530
 they come here around here and good 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.390
 truth is that you do not have much 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.890
 hide then what you want is 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.520
 defend your partner you can put 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 through those very simple columns 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.000
 what I discovered is that if you put on 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.160
 this tree 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.990
 from this respawn you can lie down 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.880
 radio we will place so that 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.590
 you can protect a little if it's that from 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.450
 far the truth that is seen but you see 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.100
 little if you put yourself right is very difficult 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.540
 that the individuals that the enemies will 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.400
 see also let's check it too 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.170
 with this with this tree if you put here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.300
 you bend a little or just 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.510
 knocking you down what is this you have the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.070
 defense to see completely then that 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.060
 more to see to see what I'm looking at and the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.500
 truth is that it has so much destined 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.580
 dating and entertaining there are many milestones 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.160
 that are blocked and can not be 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.500
 up obviously but hey let's 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.820
 see let's get ourselves here in this rest 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.489
 still the truth that the baby flag is 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.040
 easy to control then we also have 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.290
 there do not follow here the rocks or 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.170
 if I found several places and imagine 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.760
 that this is the flag that has several 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.129
 sites to be taken but good here 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.379
 we have the rocks to be good 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.769
 they are smart people it is obvious what 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.769
 we also have 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.420
 the area is centered is one of the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.420
 last that many people 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.750
 is that we have here let's say a kind 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.870
 of 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 open roof collective good 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.410
 way and here we can move is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.240
 very campero we recommend you imagine 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.030
 in a 20 you put here the granadita a 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.030
 try to do in girl and look how good 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.380
 Well the truth is that it has enough 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.140
 well then well some corner a plan 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.120
 well to hide example here in this 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.730
 station is quite not quite 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 well and then I think that there are not 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.090
 more things to say were of the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.410
 we have not seen languages here 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.450
 from here I think they had also 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.040
 several sites but perhaps more obvious are 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.840
 better known and is for example here 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.060
 you have to start the game at 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.120
 program that you are very exposed by 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.350
 example and then we have this tree of 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.980
 here will let rise mixed start the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.110
 departure 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.360
 It's a few people tend to look and the truth is 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.250
 that looks a lot very much looks on map 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.130
 you see the center over the pool is the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.270
 another show that more good a curiosity 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.900
 what is the pool seven bombs 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.270
 that you can swim the seasons 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.250
 Well, it's not that it's good for you, but 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.259
 good and good I think we're going to 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.610
 finish here this chapter surely 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.770
 I'll have left some choice and go 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.120
 barely a week and I was good yesterday 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.400
 looking for a good time here all the 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.650
 sites that I could offer you in this way 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.509
 on this map one tell you that I do not have 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.979
 thought good I do not know what will be the 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.979
 next map that I will analyze 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.030
 and well I hope you liked these 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.740
 guides takes a lot of work more than 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.259
 nothing because the sites are looking for me 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.970
 I'm watching and well it's not done in 5 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.919
 minutes so well I hope you have 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.900
 liked to leave a like if you want more and 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.880
 Well you can tell me what the 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.490
 next map that live in this guide 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.180
 so this has been a greeting and 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.720
 until next time 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.720
 bye
