00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.700
 I am a stunt ang This time I decide to sing the usual phrase speed of the guitar 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.480
 I think I want to talk 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:24.140
 Are you good at singing songs or is it February? 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:29.180
 Or have by moonlight I person is a person that can have sing in the comfort of much longer speaks 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 I think that to sing the other there are many people or some people I mean was amazing embarrassing weak 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 But I'm on the experience I 've been teaching 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.039
 Very comfortably sing people sing 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.370
 I am more of are wondering It is people such as has become a habit of the order 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:52.660
 There is an impression that the improvement of the guitar is quick 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:55.120
 As a structure structure ne of the m popular 3 music or that of music I through the coverage faith 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.000
 Melody gets on the rhythm 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.390
 I think that it is shaped like swimming, but the melody that is the core 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.150
 It's not so important to sing using your own body right now 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:16.990
 I think I would like you to sing by all means but I hope 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.369
 Well there is a guitar, so it's good to talk to the guitar 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:27.130
 If you have not reached it , sing along to cd 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:32.950
 I think it might be something to do here There are no people singing well here 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.980
 I think it is better to be careful to sing carefully than to sing well 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 Pretty it something that recently of a 4 pop music 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:55.640
 Since there is an archy song with a high song, I will try my best to the key to sell it and sing and enjoy it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.970
 Please try to sing 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.770
 In eco and compromise 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:07.500
 I think you are either very important you that sing the even-uhh Doubt said even if the song 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.479
 Since like to Voight that Doremia seems like a scale practice Mao 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.110
 Boitore Toka Aha 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.150
 Come on like a chord with a note chord 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.709
 Or a Hodone motivated say array but there Toka like a training go sing 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.670
 I think if you 're not a good person who sings well, so long as it lasts 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.470
 After all song sing existing song happily 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:49.460
 Fun politely sing and say it is very important Daidaiko 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:52.900
 Or Atati ears husband hiro very Atid progress Oh after all 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:59.300
 Or so of the song that I knew the ear copy 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.860
 Changes or something and stick it Nikki alive as soon Ogura very easy you did not hear very much 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.960
 I think it will appear 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.569
 If you are not good at singing, the first one may be shoes if you like 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.680
 a 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:18.900
 Very Toka your ears and carefully carefully go singing while firmly confirmed the pitch 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:26.310
 I think it will change a bit like playing a guitar 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.590
 If you try to take into account that you sing, you can also sing m woman's guitar too 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.819
 Hmm 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:39.040
 I think that coming up the force itself also be a reading aloud Shi get better music force since the all means usually 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:42.180
 I think that if you say that it can be incorporated in daily practice, but it is over with this time 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.180
 Thank you very much 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.489
 Four days 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.489
