00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.980 
two days alone or maybe one day I spun I
don't<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.230> how<00:02:13.379> many<00:02:13.410> crystal

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
don't know how many crystal

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.310 
don't know how many crystal
a<00:02:14.020> lot<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:15.420> don't<00:02:16.420> even<00:02:16.480> want<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.840> think<00:02:16.900> about

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
a lot I don't even want to think about

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.310 
a lot I don't even want to think about
it<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.830> point<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.820> point<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320
