in place and the wheels can move up and
down<00:01:41.850> instead<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> being<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> whole<00:01:42.990> big

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
down instead of it being the whole big

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.890 
down instead of it being the whole big
axle<00:01:43.650> which<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.430> live<00:01:44.780> makes<00:01:45.780> these

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
axle which would be live makes these

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.220 
axle which would be live makes these
cars<00:01:46.140> handle<00:01:46.530> well<00:01:46.680> drive<00:01:47.430> well<00:01:47.670> because

cars handle well drive well because

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.120 
cars handle well drive well because
believe<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.260> or<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.620> sit<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.010> these

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
the rear axle back there and so it adds

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.010 
the rear axle back there and so it adds
a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.390> arrived<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.900> get

that<00:03:57.199> run<00:03:57.409> they're<00:03:57.620> nice<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:57.859> little<00:03:58.099> bit<00:03:58.250> but

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
that run they're nice a little bit but

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.449 
that run they're nice a little bit but
from<00:03:58.699> 68<00:03:59.269> all<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.780> way<00:03:59.870> to<00:03:59.930> 82<00:04:00.440> exactly<00:04:01.370> the

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
from 68 all the way to 82 exactly the

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.030 
from 68 all the way to 82 exactly the
same<00:04:01.669> underneath<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:03.319> that's<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.560> long<00:04:03.799> run

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040

same underneath and that's a long run
for<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.840> then<00:04:05.989> they're<00:04:06.260> really<00:04:06.530> not

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
for that and then they're really not

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.890 
for that and then they're really not
much<00:04:06.829> different<00:04:07.190> from<00:04:07.220> 63<00:04:07.909> to<00:04:07.940> 70<00:04:08.479> -<00:04:08.629> except

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
much different from 63 to 70 - except

much different from 63 to 70 - except
for<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.079> brake<00:04:09.229> upgrades<00:04:09.650> than<00:04:09.949> this<00:04:10.099> -<00:04:10.340> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
for the brake upgrades than this - so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.460 
for the brake upgrades than this - so
this<00:04:11.090> soldiered<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.659> for<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> really<00:04:12.169> long<00:04:12.409> time

alright<00:04:21.019> let's<00:04:21.139> get<00:04:21.260> in<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.440> cockpit<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:21.829> a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
alright let's get in the cockpit for a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.629 
alright let's get in the cockpit for a
second<00:04:22.310> because<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:23.060> quarter

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
second because a quarter

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.489 
second because a quarter
cockpit<00:04:23.909> is<00:04:24.539> really<00:04:24.900> exactly<00:04:25.379> that<00:04:27.319> this<00:04:28.319> is

00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:28.499 
cockpit is really exactly that this is

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.200 
cockpit is really exactly that this is
nice<00:04:28.680> too<00:04:28.889> because<00:04:29.039> even<00:04:29.520> like<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.849> footwell

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
nice too because even like the footwell

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.339 
nice too because even like the footwell
lighting<00:04:30.240> works<00:04:31.789> okay

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
this has an alarm system built-in part

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.550 
this has an alarm system built-in part
of<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.199> right<00:04:37.469> here<00:04:38.749> that<00:04:39.749> key<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.259> what<00:04:40.409> they

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
of this right here that key is what they

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.869 
of this right here that key is what they
call<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.099> that's<00:04:41.310> your<00:04:41.430> why<00:04:41.520> they<00:04:41.669> call<00:04:41.849> it

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
call it and that's your why they call it

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.059 
call it and that's your why they call it
that<00:04:42.240> huge<00:04:42.539> but<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.050> uh<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.529> think<00:04:43.889> was

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
that huge but it's uh I think was

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.219 
that huge but it's uh I think was
designed<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:45.569> the<00:04:45.689> cars<00:04:45.900> could<00:04:46.080> get

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
designed so that so the cars could get

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:46.879 
designed so that so the cars could get
stolen

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
stolen

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.790 
stolen
so<00:04:47.189> all<00:04:47.400> stock<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:47.939> here<00:04:48.120> except<00:04:48.569> for<00:04:48.800> this

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
so all stock in here except for this

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.469 
so all stock in here except for this
upgraded<00:04:50.219> sound<00:04:50.490> system<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:51.029> sounds<00:04:51.270> really

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
than that but that was a spirometer out

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.950 
than that but that was a spirometer out
of<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.110> time<00:05:22.339> 7000<00:05:23.339> rpm<00:05:23.699> tach<00:05:23.969> this<00:05:24.659> is<00:05:24.810> nice

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
of the time 7000 rpm tach this is nice

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.589 
of the time 7000 rpm tach this is nice
too<00:05:25.139> because<00:05:25.259> it's<00:05:25.499> full<00:05:25.740> gauges<00:05:26.240> this<00:05:27.240> clock

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
too because it's full gauges this clock

is that this car the clock is working is
another<00:05:37.919> good<00:05:38.550> sign<00:05:38.789> these<00:05:39.029> are<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.270> little

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.850 
this car is a little bit nicer than some
of<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.810> other<00:05:42.930> cars<00:05:43.169> I've<00:05:43.349> looked<00:05:43.500> at<00:05:43.649> online

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
the footwell lighting is work like the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.579 
the footwell lighting is work like the
car<00:05:47.000> starts<00:05:48.000> right<00:05:48.210> up<00:05:48.240> each<00:05:48.599> time<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.409> a

car starts right up each time it's a
4-speed<00:05:50.279> which<00:05:50.819> makes<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.180> rare<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:52.289> it's<00:05:52.439> got

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
4-speed which makes it rare and it's got

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.139 
4-speed which makes it rare and it's got
a<00:05:52.589> nice<00:05:52.710> killer<00:05:53.159> sound<00:05:53.490> system<00:05:53.849> in<00:05:53.939> there<00:05:54.029> but

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.149 
a nice killer sound system in there but

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:56.209

hear what it sounds like a Revit for a
little<00:05:58.080> bit

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.159

such a long time you talk about a long

such a long time you talk about a long
run<00:06:17.180> for<00:06:17.749> style<00:06:18.020> from<00:06:18.229> 1968<00:06:19.009> all<00:06:19.219> the<00:06:19.309> way<00:06:19.399> to

run for style from 1968 all the way to

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.359 
run for style from 1968 all the way to
1982<00:06:20.119> that's<00:06:20.930> a<00:06:21.080> long<00:06:21.319> life<00:06:21.589> cycle<00:06:22.039> for<00:06:22.219> any

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
cycle where they didn't change it much

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.850 
cycle where they didn't change it much
either<00:06:25.729> and<00:06:25.969> the<00:06:26.360> reason<00:06:26.659> why<00:06:26.779> is<00:06:27.050> that<00:06:27.439> you

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
either and the reason why is that you
