review a little quick tip video the
gameplay<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> irrelevant<00:00:16.139> just

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
gameplay is kind of irrelevant just

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
gameplay is kind of irrelevant just
infected<00:00:17.160> gameplay<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.810> why<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> found

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
infected gameplay and why I found

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960 
infected gameplay and why I found
actually<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.710> kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.949> weird<00:00:20.189> when<00:00:20.789> you're

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
actually it's kind of weird when you're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.279 
actually it's kind of weird when you're
the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.300> infected<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.930> you're<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the first infected if you're one of the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.720 
the first infected if you're one of the
people<00:00:22.380> who<00:00:22.590> gets<00:00:22.740> chosen<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
people who gets chosen to be the first

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.790 
people who gets chosen to be the first
infected<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.630> appears<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.650> can

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
infected it appears to me that you can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
infected it appears to me that you can
move<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.460> you're<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> person<00:00:26.910> infected<00:00:27.269> which

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
move if you're the person infected which

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.240 
move if you're the person infected which
is<00:00:27.840> kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> cheap<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> me<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.859> don't<00:00:29.099> know<00:00:29.160> if

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
is kind of cheap to me I don't know if

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.800 
is kind of cheap to me I don't know if
that's<00:00:29.369> intended<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.150> way<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.599> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
that's intended to be this way but it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.330 
that's intended to be this way but it
happened<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> me<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> played<00:00:31.890> maybe<00:00:32.040> three<00:00:32.309> or

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
happened to me I played maybe three or

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.709 
happened to me I played maybe three or
so<00:00:32.550> games<00:00:32.730> trying<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.180> footage<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so games trying to get footage for this

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
so games trying to get footage for this
video<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.700> every<00:00:35.969> time<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.390> was

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
video and I don't know every time I was

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
video and I don't know every time I was
I<00:00:36.750> was<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.079> infected<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.010> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
I was the first infected so it kind of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080 
I was the first infected so it kind of
defeats<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> whole<00:00:38.430> point<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> me<00:00:38.850> getting

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
defeats the whole point of me getting

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.580 
defeats the whole point of me getting
the<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:39.989> why<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> gameplay<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the video so that's why the gameplay is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.869 
the video so that's why the gameplay is
kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> irrelevant<00:00:40.980> today<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
kind of irrelevant today you have a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
kind of irrelevant today you have a
quick<00:00:42.059> tip<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.540> guys<00:00:42.750> how<00:00:43.200> essentially

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
quick tip for you guys how essentially

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
quick tip for you guys how essentially
the<00:00:44.190> boost<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.610> KD<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.149> win-loss<00:00:45.480> ratio

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the boost your KD in your win-loss ratio

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
the boost your KD in your win-loss ratio
and<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:46.950> unorthodox<00:00:47.250> game

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and it's in the most unorthodox game

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
and it's in the most unorthodox game
mode<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> nobody<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.960> would

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
mode that nobody would think that would

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
mode that nobody would think that would
improve<00:00:49.410> their<00:00:49.590> stats<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> infected

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
improve their stats which is infected

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
improve their stats which is infected
okay<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> play<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.070> fact<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
okay so when you play in fact that you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
okay so when you play in fact that you
understand<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> works<00:00:54.120> someone<00:00:54.660> starts

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
understand how it works someone starts

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
understand how it works someone starts
as<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.410> infected<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.610> then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
as the first infected all right then

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.040 
as the first infected all right then
that<00:00:56.940> person<00:00:57.090> runs<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> knife<00:00:57.840> if

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that person runs for all the knife if

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
that person runs for all the knife if
you<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.710> knifed<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.280> become<00:00:59.520> infected

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you get knifed you become infected

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
you get knifed you become infected
eventually<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.899> whole<00:01:01.020> Lobby<00:01:01.260> becomes

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
eventually the whole Lobby becomes

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
eventually the whole Lobby becomes
infected<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.730> becomes<00:01:03.329> down<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
infected because it becomes down to so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.329 
infected because it becomes down to so
many<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.559> running<00:01:04.739> around<00:01:04.830> knifing

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
many people are running around knifing

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
many people are running around knifing
that<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.030> Bulldog<00:01:06.360> shotgun<00:01:06.780> can't<00:01:07.020> hold

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that you your Bulldog shotgun can't hold

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
that you your Bulldog shotgun can't hold
off<00:01:07.290> against<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.119> being

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
off against them all right that being

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
off against them all right that being
said<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.900> almost<00:01:10.200> impossible<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
said it's almost impossible for the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
said it's almost impossible for the
infected<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> lose<00:01:11.700> okay<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.510> you've<00:01:12.630> ever

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
infected to lose okay if you've ever

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
infected to lose okay if you've ever
actually<00:01:12.900> played<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.590> game<00:01:13.830> mode<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.490> would

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually played this game mode you would

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660 
actually played this game mode you would
know<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.140> very<00:01:16.140> regularly<00:01:16.560> probably<00:01:17.009> one

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
know that very regularly probably one

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.300 
know that very regularly probably one
percent<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> survivors

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
percent of the time will the survivors

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
percent of the time will the survivors
actually<00:01:20.310> survive<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.060> beat<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually survive and beat out the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
actually survive and beat out the
infected<00:01:22.470> alright<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.490> hard<00:01:23.700> for

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
infected alright it's really hard for

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
infected alright it's really hard for
that<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> happen<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.140> infected

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that to happen so if you play infected

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
that to happen so if you play infected
you<00:01:26.340> never<00:01:26.610> lose<00:01:27.020> okay<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.380> could<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.680> oh<00:01:28.710> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you never lose okay you could go oh in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.730 
you never lose okay you could go oh in
30<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.880> still<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.329> win

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
30 and you're still going to win

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.569 
30 and you're still going to win
ninety-nine<00:01:31.740> percent<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> time<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
ninety-nine percent of the time of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.280 
ninety-nine percent of the time of
course<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> does<00:01:33.420> happen<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.930> again

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
course you know it does happen now again

how it happens but you never end up

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
how it happens but you never end up
actually<00:01:37.350> losing<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.860> game<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.369> you're

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually losing this game but if you're

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
actually losing this game but if you're
looking<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.030> increase<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.390> kill<00:01:39.720> death

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
looking to increase your kill death
ratio<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.619> fact<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.159> also<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.430> perfect<00:01:41.790> game

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
ratio in fact it's also a perfect game

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
ratio in fact it's also a perfect game
mode<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.380> become<00:01:43.740> the
