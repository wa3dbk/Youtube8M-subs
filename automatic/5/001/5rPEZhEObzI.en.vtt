00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
 The big question today 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.639
 what we should start to look at with some detail is 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.889
 which supposes 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:10.839
 be 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.139
 together 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.469
 in educational institutions 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.189
 I want to take off for a moment 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.740
 of words like diversity 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.159
 inclusion 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.299
 respect 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.520
 difference 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 even for a moment 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 and tell them 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.409
 that reduced to its minimum expression 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.720
 but at its maximum power 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 the idea of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 what does it mean to be together 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 in educational institutions 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.680
 it seems to be somehow 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 what hurts us, what bothers us 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080
 what worries us 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.330
 what has become a desire 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.820
 throughout the institutional trajectory 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.490
 let's go wherever 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.730
 sea 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.550
 in initial education or in 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.870
 adult education 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 it seems that question 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 I do not say that the others are not important, but today 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
 what gets a prime sense is how we do 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.690
 and what does it mean 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.940
 be together 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.790
 in educational institutions. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 Someone can tell me 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.690
 that actually that is a major question 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.040
 an almost capital question 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.990
 because you could also tell me that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.280
 he is also worried 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 to the city 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.300
 this is what it means to be together in a city like Parana or like any other 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.200
 but it's also the question 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.180
 politics 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.900
 for excellence 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.110
 that is to say 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 to politics what you should be interested in is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.240
 how do we do to be together 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.120
 immediately what I would say is 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.320
 I'm not going to add a value to it, it's not being good together 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.740
 it's not being together 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.410
 in harmony 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.079
 I'm wondering about the immediately preceding, what it means to be together 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:15.179
 in each educational level this question has as different sounds 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.959
 if one goes to secondary schools today 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.739
 it is evident that it is almost THE question 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.649
 it's almost the issue 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.011
 because only 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.960
 if we can 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.629
 be together 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.839
 we can hardly be together 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.860
 without a fracture 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.779
 of such magnitude 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.339
 that each simply plays its part 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.849
 and therefore 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.569
 let's not be together 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.729
 that is, the fiction of being together and we know it, according to 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.709
 the question of being together is the one that you will deserve today 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.049
 at least in my regard in what seems to me 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.409
 to be radically central 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.209
 in the educational question 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.899
 It's that, that's it. 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:06.649
 Access to education has become universal 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:07.949
 worldwide 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.589
 so that the question is not so much 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.369
 How do I enter? 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.599
 to someone 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.389
 how do I let someone pass 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.459
 even though we know that it is still a problem and a dilemma 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.579
 bell 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.459
 what do we do once we are together 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.719
 one of my first concerns in that regard 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.309
 which may seem like a banality 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.059
 is that 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.209
 we thought 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.799
 that the presence of the other 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.569
 enough already 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.399
 to start 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.679
 a new educational path 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:47.660
 that is to say 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.909
 it was 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.149
 and it's about 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:52.700
 of the presence of someone here 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.219
 absent 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.719
 and in that sense the examples are multiple 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.709
 too big boys who were not in the education system 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.589
 street children 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.839
 people with disabilities 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:08.889
 lost childhoods in various ways 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.480
 and that considerable effort has been made 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.340
 honest 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.039
 interesting 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.439
 to bring them in 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:22.499
 enrollment at international level has grown to levels 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:24.400
 unpublished 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.309
 however 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.580
 what 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.460
 pass 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.849
 once the presence is 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.699
 is what 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.680
 we keep asking ourselves 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.189
 about that presence 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.279
 when I actually believe 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.650
 that today 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.550
 not so interesting 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.180
 ask for that presence 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.080
 bell 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.650
 for something that we will call and that we will try to work and clarify 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.059
 and think 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.460
 the existence 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.270
 of others 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.979
 to be present is 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.110
 neither more nor less than 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.099
 a material position 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.889
 It is true that not many were 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.939
 gifts 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.499
 but once we are present 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.140
 how much the educational projects 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.240
 touch existence 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 of people 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.400
 how much they become critical for 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.669
 its existence 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.259
 how much of its existence is known to teachers 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.050
 how much of its existence 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.940
 weighs when it comes to planning, thinking 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.650
 to propose activities 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.840
 or I repeat how it has happened in many places 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.289
 it's just about 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.639
 of a presence game 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.949
 something like saying 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.300
 well we are all 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.569
 now 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:54.600
 let's go back 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.520
 to more traditional pedagogies 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.439
 and what it is about is that if in fact 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.080
 there is a good presence 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.430
 the great question now, the great challenge before us 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.949
 is how that pedagogy becomes interesting 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:11.960
 for each 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.460
 existence 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.719
 and not so much 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.619
 for each presence 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:19.499
 With inclusion 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:21.580
 it has happened to us 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.330
 that the recipients, the subjects 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.439
 the concrete people 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.999
 they tell us 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:33.219
 and about that we are working a lot from stories of people who have passed 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.840
 projects 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.409
 inclusion 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.830
 that effectively 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.199
 have been there. 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.449
 But not necessarily, I'll say it wrong 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.800
 have been there 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.309
 if understood 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.749
 what somehow these testimonies indicate us 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:56.759
 it's one thing to be 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.719
 and another thing is to be. 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.009
 How many of the new educational projects 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.149
 have insisted on being 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:09.069
 but what do we do 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.669
 with that BEING in the educational Being. 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.869
 Start with a question almost 

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.809
 Shakespearean 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.740
 it seems to be a bit weird 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.210
 with the urgencies we have 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.039
 but they want me to tell you, I confess I do not know 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.229
 greater urgency 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:39.229
 that the existence of someone. I do not know. 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.310
 I do not know any more 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.830
 concern 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.869
 to ask for the existence of another 

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:48.389
 that it's not me 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.179
 I do not know her 

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.270
 that is why I necessarily put myself in this perspective 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.999
 I do not want to say that you should 

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:58.370
 follow this line 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.460
 although I say that 

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.110
 to what we have done about the presence 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.099
 today would not hurt to give it a few laps 

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:09.419
 very serious 

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.259
 to the theme of stocks 

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:13.439
 something like 

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:17.309
 school stocks not so much as ghosts 

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:18.549
 but true existences.
