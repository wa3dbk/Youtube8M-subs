00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.940
Griff &gt;&gt;  All right Tony so what are some of the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.500
things that you do to keep safe in the car?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.959
Tony &gt;&gt; Well a lot of things that people

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.030
don't know is a lot of the stuff that we

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.639
develop here you can ended up having on

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.820
your own streetcar.  Yeah, I mean a lot of

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.590
the features that like the ABS system

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.380
that doesn't lock the brakes and a lot

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.560
of the features that we develop on the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.779
engine and on the car itself we ended up

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.429
giving to the manufacturers to make

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.790
the normal cars, I would say safe

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.190
but we travel at 230 miles an hour at

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.470
the time and we have an open

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.629
cockpit basically my head is exposed

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.510
which is very dangerous

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.309
we do refueling it's not like you go to

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.049
the normal gas station and then you feel

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.720
I mean we have we put 30 gallons in a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.250
car in eight seconds so that's very

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.199
dangerous because it can spill the fuel

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.909
so we got to have an Omax which is a

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.150
type of material like this that is the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.920
same material my racing suit that

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.049
doesn't allow you to burn yourself.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.920
The helmet itself it's very hard.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
It's not heavy.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.280
Griff &gt;&gt; Oh, it's very light.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.210
Tony &gt;&gt; It's a made of Kevlar so it's a very

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.759
safe material in carbon fiber which is

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.409
the same material at the race car.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.388
Griff &gt;&gt; So less inertia in there.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:17.320
Tony&gt;&gt; And I would call

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.619
this is the new feature that we, I mean

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.140
race car drivers, develop over the years.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.170
It's called the Hans device and basically you put

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.799
this around your neck and you buckle to

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.240
the helmet.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.009
Unfortunately you cannot use that on your

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.439
normal car but if you if you crash head

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.930
on your head has a tendency to move forward.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.549
Griff &gt;&gt; Right,  it's just going to continue forward

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.020
your body is going to be stopped by the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.700
seatbelt, the restraint system but the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.990
inertia of your head is going to continue.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.780
Tony &gt;&gt; Exactly, so basically having

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.350
this on strapped on the belts and these

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.600
two belts attached to the helmet once

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.729
you move forward it's going to stop at

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.770
one point it's going to stop your head

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.630
and it's going to prevent you to break

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.700
your neck.  When we back to the wall we

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.560
have the headrest in the car that I can

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.080
show you guys, it's made by foam and we have

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.870
you know basically on the side here on the other

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.090
side and in the back and this this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.769
feature here which is we call the

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.319
headrest it's fully it's full filled

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.360
with foam as well so basically when you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.610
crash backwards you pretty much safe.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.709
Griff &gt;&gt; And your belt system that you're using?

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.269
Tony &gt;&gt; We have a six-point belt which is going to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.830
be a little bit difficult for me to show

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.560
you guys here but basically it comes to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.799
pieces right here and then two pieces

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.540
come between your legs and the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.150
other two pieces on top of your

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.340
shoulders and they attach to one buckle

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.260
so basically your protect from a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840
head on crash you won't slid in.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.280
Griff &gt;&gt; Right, you want submarine underneath the steering wheel.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.370
Tony &gt;&gt; Exactly.  The two shoulder belts will prevent

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.709
you from lifting the other two just to hold you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.940
up but basically it's a very complicated

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.980
system to have in a normal car

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.180
because we'll take you more than a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.190
minute to buck yourself in and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.450
people on the street they won't have the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.819
patient do it and obviously we're not

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.030
traveling as fast as we do it here so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.069
that's why race cars have we called the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.790
six-point belt.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.050
Basically a race car is custom built for the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.300
driver I mean the driver's seat it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.050
it's it's a foam seat then it's a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.180
special material that was developed and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.510
we mix with a resin that we suck air our

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.640
out of it so basically you sit and uh

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.100
looks like a the kids at home like just

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.540
sit on a pillow in a very soft pillow

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.840
right and it would form your body and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.760
then you suck the air out if that resin

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.190
and after an hour it's it moulds your

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.410
body so basically that's what we have in

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.850
the race car so we can't gain any weight

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.360
or anything here and it won't fit and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
for last but not least the gloves I mean

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.170
obviously trying to prevent from fires.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.650
Griff &gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.550
