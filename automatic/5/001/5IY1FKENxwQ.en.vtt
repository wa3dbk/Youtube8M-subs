00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.449
 and then people all right with you are 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.830
 black again 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.750
 and this time I bring this video that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 I'm very happy to do it because I 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 same video card 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 Yes, I did not have a video card, I did not. 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.849
 I could record anything by playing on my 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.679
 computer nothing had not got games that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.989
 run on it without video card 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.390
 only that the current games could not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 play nothing until maine craft non-microsoft 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 ran if they can not put 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 those that those molds of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 visual in hd that does not wheel has much game 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 than my computer did not 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 video card 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.239
 but that's okay with me, because like me 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 record videos with playstation 3 to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.010
 It's tranquil, right? 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.410
 but had a problem is also called 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.539
 video editing and said my videos 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.059
 You know I do an edit. 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 always have to do the same. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.979
 well-edited video and what 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 It happens to see the pre 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 visualization and even the effects that the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.060
 transition is to improve the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 texture agreement and everything else weighs a little 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.700
 and no video card is a ppp 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.100
 performance of the video and the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 even edit everything should know that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 you need to have at least one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 good video and a good processor for you 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 type your videos 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 I think the processor it is not so 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.460
 Bad so it's old enough the quadricolor 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.430
 yes it's no family and nothing 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 but I think the mobile processor has to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 change it but it's not the time yet I do not 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.009
 I have not had video card I had 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 I want so much to have one that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.180
 I lacked money and I won this badge 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.009
 video of a great friend of mine 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 of the old ones and we started 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.070
 youtube almost together at once 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.259
 has known over time and will only 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.420
 to improve the personal life I was yesterday 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.430
 in the program decided on Sunday 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.390
 people did a light to his channel with 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.520
 staff there I had the challenge 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.740
 that we are a group that we have set up and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.600
 pokhara when he was left out for me 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.220
 that gives me something that is that which is 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.840
 even one thing I like very much a 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.520
 something that I liked very much and was already 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.959
 almost finishing it, I said, man. 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.330
 who he's always said that I would like 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.040
 a lot there was the backpack took the guy and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.540
 I was wrapped in a 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.940
 button stretch now for you to see the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.070
 divide I did not like it much better 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:53.400
 difficult that some insisted that it is 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:55.709
 bathroom partner O according to equipos ã 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.370

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.370

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.260
 I knew and that's when I got there. 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.970
 I was very happy and I could not 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.349
 hide the happiness because to me 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.790
 this is too expensive 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.140
 there is a sign that will help my 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.150
 work is a plant that will facilitate 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.040
 too much in my work and I will 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.500
 For sure there are other games and power 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.360

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.180
