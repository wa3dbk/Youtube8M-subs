my<00:00:53.340> question<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.570> add<00:00:54.989> 1<00:00:55.500> 0<00:00:55.800> 0<00:00:56.100> +<00:00:56.670> 1

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
my question is this if you add 1 0 0 + 1

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.069 
my question is this if you add 1 0 0 + 1
0<00:00:57.149> 0<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.410> -<00:00:58.710> 0<00:00:58.739> 0<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.489> all<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.899> 2

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
0 0 it is - 0 0 right all right that's 2

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.080 
0 0 it is - 0 0 right all right that's 2
minutes<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.190> food<00:01:02.399> will<00:01:02.609> cook<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
minutes so your food will cook for a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
minutes so your food will cook for a
total<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> 2<00:01:03.719> minutes<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> add<00:01:05.100> 60

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
total of 2 minutes but if you add 60

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
total of 2 minutes but if you add 60
seconds<00:01:06.330> +<00:01:06.570> 60<00:01:07.020> seconds<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.740> only<00:01:07.860> cook

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
seconds + 60 seconds it will only cook

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
seconds + 60 seconds it will only cook
for<00:01:08.430> 1<00:01:08.610> minute<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> 20<00:01:09.390> seconds

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
for 1 minute and 20 seconds

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.469 
for 1 minute and 20 seconds
even<00:01:10.439> though<00:01:10.560> 60<00:01:11.010> seconds<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> 1<00:01:11.850> minute<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
even though 60 seconds is 1 minute I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
even though 60 seconds is 1 minute I
know<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> confusing<00:01:13.320> question<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
know it's a confusing question so I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
know it's a confusing question so I
guess<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.479> simplest<00:01:15.900> terms<00:01:16.229> how

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
guess to put it into simplest terms how

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
guess to put it into simplest terms how
come<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.310> minute<00:01:17.700> +<00:01:18.030> 1<00:01:18.299> minute<00:01:18.689> equals<00:01:19.140> 2

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
come one minute + 1 minute equals 2

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.219 
come one minute + 1 minute equals 2
minutes<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.220> 60<00:01:20.640> seconds<00:01:21.119> +<00:01:21.330> 60<00:01:21.750> seconds

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
minutes but 60 seconds + 60 seconds

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.319 
minutes but 60 seconds + 60 seconds
equals<00:01:22.710> only<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.400> minute<00:01:28.700> yeah<00:01:29.700> dude<00:01:30.090> I'm

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
equals only one minute yeah dude I'm

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
equals only one minute yeah dude I'm
trying<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> figure<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
trying to figure out here you're like is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.740 
trying to figure out here you're like is
60<00:01:32.369> seconds<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.000> minute<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> same

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
60 seconds on one minute really the same

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
60 seconds on one minute really the same
or<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.170> been<00:01:34.320> live<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.890> got

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
or have we been live I just got

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
or have we been live I just got
paperplane<00:01:38.600> do<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> could<00:01:40.110> be

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
paperplane do you think it could be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.490 
paperplane do you think it could be
something<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> microwave<00:01:41.960> wait<00:01:42.960> okay

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
something with the microwave wait okay

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
something with the microwave wait okay
I've<00:01:43.740> been<00:01:43.770> contently<00:01:44.520> listening<00:01:45.000> hi<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.630> name

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I've been contently listening hi my name

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.460 
I've been contently listening hi my name
is<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.350> Nevins<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.320> confuses<00:01:49.320> me

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is is Nevins this this this confuses me

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
is is Nevins this this this confuses me
as<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.399> thinking<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.119> maybe

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
as well so are we thinking that maybe

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
as well so are we thinking that maybe
it's<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.899> microwave<00:01:52.439> fault<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.130> not

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it's the microwave fault and not

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's the microwave fault and not
mathematics<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:59.930> never<00:02:00.930> thought<00:02:01.140> about<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
mathematics I never thought about that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.929 
mathematics I never thought about that
man<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.950> never<00:02:02.009> thought<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.369> could<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.670> liked

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
man I never thought I could have liked

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.580 
man I never thought I could have liked
it<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.509> maybe<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> bad

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

what<00:02:27.739> kind<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:27.980> microwave<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.760> Susie

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.210 

see<00:02:33.560> I've<00:02:33.829> got<00:02:34.390> I've<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.420> Maytag<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.440> maybe

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
see I've got I've got Maytag so maybe

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.920 
see I've got I've got Maytag so maybe
maybe<00:02:37.459> yeah<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.150> they<00:02:38.299> don't<00:02:38.480> do<00:02:38.720> much

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
maybe yeah because they don't do much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.899 
maybe yeah because they don't do much
Maytag<00:02:39.409> stuff<00:02:39.709> anymore<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> think<00:02:40.370> that

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
Maytag stuff anymore so I think that

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.849 
Maytag stuff anymore so I think that
might<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.150> my<00:02:41.420> problem<00:02:41.689> really<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> after<00:02:42.709> this

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859
