00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
followed in rebirth is basically a race

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.550

against the clock to find a cure we just
we<00:01:53.650> always<00:01:53.890> kind<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.220> had<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.550> concept<00:01:55.120> that

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
we always kind of had this concept that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.600 
we always kind of had this concept that
joburg<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.200> Africa's<00:01:56.740> Gotham<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.340> mean<00:01:57.490> if

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
joburg is like Africa's Gotham I mean if

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.660 
joburg is like Africa's Gotham I mean if
you<00:01:57.790> were<00:01:57.970> if<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:59.140> were<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.350> vampire<00:01:59.710> driver

you were if you were a vampire driver
will<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.180> place<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.420> be<00:02:01.780> we've<00:02:02.530> both<00:02:03.040> grown

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
will be the place to be we've both grown

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.120 
will be the place to be we've both grown
up<00:02:03.820> here<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.690> think<00:02:05.229> anybody<00:02:05.590> knows<00:02:05.890> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
up here and I think anybody knows the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.870 
up here and I think anybody knows the
city<00:02:06.400> knows<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.970> it's<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.649> pretty

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
city knows that it's it's a pretty

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.330 
city knows that it's it's a pretty
intense<00:02:09.880> place<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.840> be<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:13.800> think<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> power<00:02:15.160> of

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
intense place to be I think the power of
