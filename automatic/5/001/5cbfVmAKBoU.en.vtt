you go to the description I have both of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
you go to the description I have both of
the<00:00:28.980> seed<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.400> by<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.699> way<00:00:29.820> ibx<00:00:30.300> town

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the seed which is by the way ibx town

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440 
the seed which is by the way ibx town
with<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:30.929> E's<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.590> extra<00:00:32.309> care<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.700> loads

with two E's I be extra care and loads

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
with two E's I be extra care and loads
coordinates<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.190> 126<00:00:35.190> times<00:00:35.460> with

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
coordinates are 126 times with

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.190 
coordinates are 126 times with
coordinates<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
coordinates and basically you can go to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
coordinates and basically you can go to
these<00:00:37.530> cornets<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.129> his<00:00:38.520> play<00:00:38.790> example<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
these cornets which his play example of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.280 
these cornets which his play example of
a<00:00:39.270> coordinate<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.050> coordinates

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a coordinate you go to these coordinates

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
a coordinate you go to these coordinates
and<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.070> yourself<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.489> diamonds<00:00:41.850> then

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and you get yourself these diamonds then

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.459 
and you get yourself these diamonds then
you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.239> head<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> next<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you can head to the next one because you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.170 
you can head to the next one because you
have<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> coordinates<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.730> saves<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
have all the coordinates it saves so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.430 
have all the coordinates it saves so
much<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> process<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> mining<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.230> gives

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
much for the process of mining and gives

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
much for the process of mining and gives
you<00:00:46.500> 126<00:00:47.219> diamonds<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> maybe<00:00:47.940> 20<00:00:48.270> minutes<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you 126 diamonds and maybe 20 minutes of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
you 126 diamonds and maybe 20 minutes of
mining<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.559> means<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.100> 20

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
mining which means it's not in 20

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.529 
mining which means it's not in 20
minutes<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> learning<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.420> the

this village a six explain why the seed
is<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.200> cool<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> weights<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:13.799> diamonds

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
is so cool of weights because diamonds

is so cool of weights because diamonds
are<00:01:14.189> cool<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:14.939> seed<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
are cool but you need a good seed to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.340 
are cool but you need a good seed to
make<00:01:15.570> use<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.020> right

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
make use of them right

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
make use of them right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
or at least you know a seed that's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.920 
or at least you know a seed that's
usable<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.180> explain<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> seed

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
usable so let's explain when this seed

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
usable so let's explain when this seed
is<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.200> cool<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.580> spawn<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.450> side<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
is so cool so you spawn on the side of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
is so cool so you spawn on the side of
this<00:01:21.869> big<00:01:22.290> hill<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.100> strange

this big hill which is you know strange

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
this big hill which is you know strange
place<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> smaller<00:01:24.000> hill<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:25.049> coming<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
place to smaller hill not coming that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
place to smaller hill not coming that
that<00:01:25.590> happens<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.070> basically<00:01:26.490> behind<00:01:27.240> you

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
literally that flat right you know that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.930 
literally that flat right you know that
close<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.890> something<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.400> yeah<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.700> cool

map another key feature of the map one

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.970 
map another key feature of the map one
the<00:03:21.540> best<00:03:21.750> parts<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.140> map<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.410> my<00:03:22.530> opinion<00:03:22.860> is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the best parts of map in my opinion is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640 
the best parts of map in my opinion is
if<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.430> head<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.820> west<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.049> middle<00:03:25.590> of

if you head to the west of the middle of
the<00:03:25.709> map<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.700> almost<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.030> exact
