00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.670 
my entire idea is that oh I have to go
through<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.210> world<00:01:48.509> find<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> village<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
through this world find a village so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
through this world find a village so
find<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.340> village<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:52.040> hate<00:01:53.040> spiders<00:01:53.570> hate<00:01:54.570> them

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
find a village I hate spiders hate them

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.679 
find a village I hate spiders hate them
just<00:01:55.020> hate<00:01:55.770> spiders<00:01:56.340> spiders<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.969> dead<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.390> me

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
just hate spiders spiders are dead to me

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
just hate spiders spiders are dead to me
so<00:01:57.990> anytime<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> spider<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.579> attack

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
