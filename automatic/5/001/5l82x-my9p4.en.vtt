00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.760
 something so obvious 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.950
 for a certain common 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.640
 the name that has been put is said 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.640
 ivÃ¡n 3 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.390
 because between because they are three super 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.570
 large that is on the scene we will open 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 too many marc anthony and chayanne the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.460
 third we will reveal them soon 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.519
 back to this list the sizes too 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.589
 of course and good the dynamics of this 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.720
 concert to different unlike 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.940
 others now have been as Latin party 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.990
 or other shows that have been festivals 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.090
 here in Peru 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.440
 in the world in which a 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.410
 artist finishes his presentation set and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.860
 next artist 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.440
 this show has something unusual 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.110
 they definitely share the stage 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.540
 marking the actions of relationships but 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.040
 there are songs both on one side and the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 another one that will participate the two 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.320
 Many will say it started on August 3 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.710
 in Miami 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.480
 in america and I was traveling for everything 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.390
 What is it 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.380
 and Central America 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 well this tour in some countries the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.820
 third giant but for the limbo state 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.909
 putting something that is more to our 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 taste 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.040
 all right 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.830
 the ceramist the staging is 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 made based on what each city asks 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.540
 and let's listen to the hits in song 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.540
 of each artist in fact fair 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.209
 I know you 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.870
 remember that both bring and marked 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.269
 nor giving the few artists 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.580
 they are latinos their productions green is 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.870
 totally American producer 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 and 2 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.620
 I work for the social ones that are always 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.620
 they exist to have the last 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.520
 of August 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.640
 It has demanded a lot of production time 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.920
 previous 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.490
 are this engine is like that sir the screams 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.490
 of the moment 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.520
 the light is the same stage eye is presented 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 that everything is done so that there is a 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.090
 protagonist is the three 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.400
 protagonists 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.770
 then major 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.260
 plus 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.790
 The whole issue in production is 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.830
 accompanied by the talent of them that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 thank god they are very good friends 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.470
 then this helps that there is a 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.470
 which adds quite 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.330
 the public price without bridge to cause 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.790
 from this impression I knew 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.590
 in comparison to other shows that have 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.180
 than apply the suggested discounts 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 some trend with the card 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.490
 interbank to the template is not 490 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.060
 suns in the life of these pressures 70 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.770
 the preference in usa 35 the grandstand 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.190
 it's 130 natural 90 and the beach only 35 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.760
 it's time to see square and vivanda 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:55.320
 acquire special discounts for 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.610
 I really invite everyone to enjoy 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.610
 this great national
