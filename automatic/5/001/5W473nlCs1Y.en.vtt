00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
about when laying out your bottom plates

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.509 
about when laying out your bottom plates
whether<00:00:08.309> you're<00:00:08.820> framing<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.519> concrete

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
whether you're framing on a concrete

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.110 
whether you're framing on a concrete
slab<00:00:11.639> or<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.750> wood<00:00:13.320> subfloor<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.880> one

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to go now here's the problem let's just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570 
to go now here's the problem let's just
say<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.680> lift<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.159> wall

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
say that you are going to lift this wall

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
say that you are going to lift this wall
up<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.150> were<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.390> frame<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> wall<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
up you were gonna frame the wall on the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.969 
up you were gonna frame the wall on the
ground<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:09.290> lift<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
ground and then lift it up you're just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
ground and then lift it up you're just
gonna<00:01:11.280> tilt<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.030> which<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.439> common<00:01:13.439> for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
gonna tilt it up which is common for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.030 
gonna tilt it up which is common for
most<00:01:14.330> framers<00:01:15.330> well<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
most framers well that would be a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030 
most framers well that would be a
problem<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.790> couldn't<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.600> lift<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.259> wall<00:01:19.740> up

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
problem you couldn't just lift a wall up

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.710 
problem you couldn't just lift a wall up
like<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.470> with<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> notches<00:01:23.390> where<00:01:24.390> they're

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
like this with the notches where they're

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.670 
like this with the notches where they're
at<00:01:25.700> around<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.030> pipes<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.720> wall<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
at around the pipes a wall like this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.330 
at around the pipes a wall like this
would<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.400> raised<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.740> then<00:01:31.740> lift

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
would need to be raised up and then lift

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.640 
would need to be raised up and then lift
it<00:01:32.640> above<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> tallest<00:01:34.829> plumbing<00:01:35.460> pipe<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
it above the tallest plumbing pipe and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.100 
it above the tallest plumbing pipe and
then<00:01:37.650> slid<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.210> place<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:42.110> be

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
then slid down into place so just be

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.219 
then slid down into place so just be
aware<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.880> problems<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.659> when<00:01:46.110> you're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
aware of problems like these when you're

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
aware of problems like these when you're
laying<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:46.979> bottom<00:01:47.729> plates<00:01:48.259> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
laying out your bottom plates for

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
laying out your bottom plates for
plumbing<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.610> again<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.119> might<00:01:51.390> be

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
plumbing and again this might be

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
plumbing and again this might be
difficult<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> imagine<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> could

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
difficult to imagine but if you could

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.539 
difficult to imagine but if you could
just<00:01:53.520> imagine<00:01:54.140> someone<00:01:55.140> framing<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.040> wall<00:01:56.280> on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
just imagine someone framing a wall on

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.370 
just imagine someone framing a wall on
the<00:01:56.850> ground<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.329> wall<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> completely

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the ground the wall is completely

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.520 
the ground the wall is completely
assembled<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.479> then<00:02:00.479> lifting<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.290> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
assembled and then lifting it up you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
assembled and then lifting it up you
couldn't<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.159> slide<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.750> place<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
couldn't just slide it into place you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
couldn't just slide it into place you
couldn't<00:02:04.619> lift<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> wall<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.570> let's<00:02:06.810> just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
couldn't lift the wall up and let's just

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
couldn't lift the wall up and let's just
say<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.530> wall<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:08.039> setting<00:02:08.489> it's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
say that the wall was setting it's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.020 
say that the wall was setting it's
lifted<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.020> place<00:02:10.340> except<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.520> sitting

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
lifted up in place except it's sitting

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.960 
lifted up in place except it's sitting
on<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.050> side

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
on this side

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.170

plumbing let's just say it's sitting on
this<00:02:19.920> side<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.820> couldn't<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.390> slide<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.170> in

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480 
this side you couldn't just slide it in
because<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.270> knotch<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
because the knotch here is on the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.230 
because the knotch here is on the
opposite<00:02:26.970> side<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.920> notch<00:02:29.430> went<00:02:29.970> this

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
opposite side if this notch went this

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.680 
opposite side if this notch went this
way<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.950> notched<00:02:32.280> everything<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
way you you notched everything in the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
way you you notched everything in the
same<00:02:33.960> direction<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.670> notched<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.510> out

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
same direction and you notched this out

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.420 
same direction and you notched this out
here<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.700> notched<00:02:39.000> out<00:02:39.300> also

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
here and then this was notched out also

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.130 
here and then this was notched out also
then<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.460> could<00:02:41.820> actually<00:02:42.000> slide<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> wall

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
then you could actually slide the wall

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.070 
then you could actually slide the wall
into<00:02:43.620> place<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.060> wouldn't<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.660> able<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
into place but you wouldn't be able to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.310 
into place but you wouldn't be able to
do<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.520> if<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.180> notches<00:02:48.480> going

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
do that if you have your notches going

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.910 
do that if you have your notches going
in<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> opposite<00:02:50.070> direction<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:52.170> you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
in the opposite direction or if you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000 
in the opposite direction or if you
notched<00:02:53.280> around<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.570> pipes<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.710> one

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
notched around the pipes like this one

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.340 
notched around the pipes like this one
and<00:02:56.250> again<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.880> hope<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.630> makes<00:02:57.960> sense

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and again I hope that makes sense

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.540 
and again I hope that makes sense
because<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.600> big<00:03:00.600> deal<00:03:01.070> for<00:03:02.070> home

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
because this is a big deal for home

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.630 
because this is a big deal for home
builders<00:03:02.790> or<00:03:03.180> carpenters<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.920> don't

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
builders or carpenters that really don't

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.610 
builders or carpenters that really don't
understand<00:03:07.340> how<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.400> whole<00:03:09.170> building<00:03:10.170> gets

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
understand how the whole building gets

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.440 
understand how the whole building gets
assembled<00:03:11.190> especially<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.240> wall

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
assembled especially with the wall

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.230 
assembled especially with the wall
framing<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.950> again<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.580> said<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:15.030> you're<00:03:15.180> a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
framing so again like I said if you're a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.880 
framing so again like I said if you're a
carpenter<00:03:15.540> you're<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.110> starting<00:03:16.500> out<00:03:16.680> or

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
carpenter you're just starting out or

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.160 
carpenter you're just starting out or
you're<00:03:17.400> building<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:18.000> home<00:03:18.180> yourself<00:03:18.450> make

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you're building a home yourself make

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.250 
you're building a home yourself make
sure<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.790> understand<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:22.110> this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
sure that you understand all of this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.800 
sure that you understand all of this
stuff<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.739> I'm<00:03:22.950> did<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.700> shared<00:03:24.690> with

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
stuff that I'm did I just shared with

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
stuff that I'm did I just shared with
you<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> video<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:26.130> otherwise

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you in the video because otherwise

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.370 
you in the video because otherwise
you're<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.940> end<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.420> framing<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.170> wall

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you're going to end up framing a wall

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.160 
you're going to end up framing a wall
tilting<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.550> trying<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.780> lift<00:03:31.020> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
tilting it up and trying to lift the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.400 
tilting it up and trying to lift the
wall<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.650> damaging<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.550> pipes<00:03:32.989> all<00:03:33.989> sorts<00:03:34.350> of

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
wall up damaging the pipes all sorts of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.600 
wall up damaging the pipes all sorts of
things<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.739> mean<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.070> could<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.250> imagine

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
things I mean if you could just imagine

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.960 
things I mean if you could just imagine
lifting<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.330> wall<00:03:36.600> up<00:03:37.160> on<00:03:38.160> top<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> pipe

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
lifting a wall up on top of the pipe

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.440 
lifting a wall up on top of the pipe
like<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.690> isn't<00:03:39.840> strapped<00:03:40.320> properly

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
like this that isn't strapped properly

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.710 
like this that isn't strapped properly
and<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:43.350> thing<00:03:43.680> caves<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.300> bends

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
and this thing caves in and then bends

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.930 
and this thing caves in and then bends
the<00:03:46.020> copper<00:03:46.709> pipes<00:03:46.980> I've<00:03:47.310> seen<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.820> stuff

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
the copper pipes I've seen this stuff

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.660 
the copper pipes I've seen this stuff
happen<00:03:48.480> before<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.350> like<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.340> said<00:03:50.400> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
happen before so like I said the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.670 
happen before so like I said the
information<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.450> video<00:03:51.690> might<00:03:52.290> sound

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
information in this video might sound

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.190 
information in this video might sound
like<00:03:52.950> it's<00:03:53.190> not<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.610> big<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:54.090> deal<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.720> it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
like it's not that big of a deal but it

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.699 
like it's not that big of a deal but it
will<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.980> trust<00:03:56.430> me<00:03:56.670> if<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.450> end<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:57.959> cutting

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
will be trust me if you end up cutting

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.630 
will be trust me if you end up cutting
around<00:03:59.520> the<00:04:00.000> pipes<00:04:00.620> cut<00:04:01.620> notching<00:04:02.310> your

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
around the pipes cut notching your

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.550 
around the pipes cut notching your
bottom<00:04:03.209> plates<00:04:03.739> in<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.890> wrong<00:04:05.100> spots
