is going to be a very basic tutorial
where<00:00:33.680> we're<00:00:33.860> going<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.190> review<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.880> notes<00:00:35.390> of

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
where we're going to review the notes of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.560 
where we're going to review the notes of
a<00:00:35.990> keyboard<00:00:36.560> and<00:00:36.970> one<00:00:37.970> thing<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:38.210> have<00:00:38.390> to

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
a keyboard and one thing you have to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.300 
a keyboard and one thing you have to
understand<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.290> these<00:00:39.740> notes<00:00:40.010> are

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
understand is that these notes are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.490 
understand is that these notes are
always<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.240> same<00:00:41.480> notes<00:00:41.750> in<00:00:41.900> any<00:00:42.140> kind<00:00:42.410> of

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
always the same notes in any kind of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.750 
always the same notes in any kind of
instruments<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:43.220> here<00:00:43.430> we're<00:00:43.580> going<00:00:43.700> to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
instruments but here we're going to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.970 
instruments but here we're going to
reviewing<00:00:44.300> an<00:00:44.540> instrument<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:45.290> can<00:00:45.530> be

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
reviewing an instrument that can be

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.910 
reviewing an instrument that can be
played<00:00:46.220> with<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.430> keyboard<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.470> it<00:00:48.470> can<00:00:48.650> be<00:00:48.770> an

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
played with a keyboard so it can be an

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280 
played with a keyboard so it can be an
organic<00:00:49.340> e<00:00:49.730> electronic<00:00:50.210> keyboard<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.750> piano<00:00:51.110> an

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
organic e electronic keyboard a piano an

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.710 
organic e electronic keyboard a piano an
acoustic<00:00:51.620> piano<00:00:51.890> an<00:00:52.100> electric<00:00:52.489> piano<00:00:52.670> even<00:00:53.570> a

acoustic piano an electric piano even a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.810 
acoustic piano an electric piano even a
harpsichord<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.120> divided<00:00:56.570> in<00:00:56.720> white

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
harpsichord so this is divided in white

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.259 
harpsichord so this is divided in white
keys<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:58.850> Black<00:00:59.510> Keys<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.550> Black<00:01:01.790> Keys<00:01:02.000> are

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
keys and Black Keys the Black Keys are

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.680 
keys and Black Keys the Black Keys are
always<00:01:02.589> group<00:01:03.589> in<00:01:03.890> 2<00:01:04.790> &amp;<00:01:05.059> 3<00:01:05.740> 2<00:01:06.740> &amp;<00:01:06.770> 3<00:01:07.040> 2<00:01:08.030> &amp;<00:01:08.060> 3<00:01:08.360> and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
always group in 2 &amp; 3 2 &amp; 3 2 &amp; 3 and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.720 
always group in 2 &amp; 3 2 &amp; 3 2 &amp; 3 and
this<00:01:09.140> pattern<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.650> repeated<00:01:09.680> all<00:01:10.280> over<00:01:10.580> the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
this pattern is repeated all over the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.800 
this pattern is repeated all over the
keys<00:01:11.890> 2<00:01:12.890> 3<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.700> very<00:01:14.210> useful<00:01:14.690> because

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
keys 2 3 and this is very useful because

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.310 
keys 2 3 and this is very useful because
it<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.350> help<00:01:15.530> us<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.980> identify<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:17.300> notes<00:01:17.510> if

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
it can help us to identify the notes if

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.410 
it can help us to identify the notes if
you<00:01:18.380> want<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.830> anta<00:01:19.070> fide<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.370> main<00:01:19.610> note<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.270> a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
you want to anta fide the main note in a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.360 
you want to anta fide the main note in a
keyboard<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:20.930> called<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> central<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:21.979> the

keyboard is called the central or the
middle<00:01:22.700> C<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.040> middle<00:01:25.040> C<00:01:25.190> can<00:01:25.370> be<00:01:25.400> identified

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
middle C the middle C can be identified

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.500 
middle C the middle C can be identified
when<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.890> look<00:01:27.890> for<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.430> group<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.030> two<00:01:29.270> Black

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
when you look for a group of two Black

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.230 
when you look for a group of two Black
Keys<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:32.420> before<00:01:33.490> once<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:34.939> step

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
Keys and just before once that have step

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.959 
Keys and just before once that have step
back<00:01:35.479> from<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.020> first<00:01:36.259> note<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.610> group<00:01:37.790> of

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
back from the first note of the group of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.289 
back from the first note of the group of
two<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.740> going<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.100> be<00:01:40.219> always<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.939> C

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
two that is going to be always the C

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.880 
two that is going to be always the C
note<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.259> doesn't<00:01:42.409> matter<00:01:42.799> if<00:01:43.130> you're<00:01:43.610> playing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
note it doesn't matter if you're playing

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.920 
note it doesn't matter if you're playing
in<00:01:45.890> any<00:01:46.039> octave<00:01:46.460> always<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.539> see<00:01:47.750> a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
in any octave always that you see a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.830 
in any octave always that you see a
group<00:01:48.079> of<00:01:48.259> two<00:01:48.500> before<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> first<00:01:49.789> note<00:01:50.630> is

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
group of two before the first note is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.260 
group of two before the first note is
going<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.229> always<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:52.000> C<00:01:53.000> 2<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.170> C<00:01:55.009> 2<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.729> C

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270 

now<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.329> nomenclature<00:02:00.200> here<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.710> going<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.159> be

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
now the nomenclature here is going to be

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.029 
now the nomenclature here is going to be
with<00:02:01.520> letters<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.420> has<00:02:03.259> an<00:02:03.469> alphabetical

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
with letters it has an alphabetical

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.880 
with letters it has an alphabetical
order<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:05.030> doesn't<00:02:05.659> start<00:02:05.990> hearing<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.619> C

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
order but it doesn't start hearing the C

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.150 
order but it doesn't start hearing the C
it<00:02:07.250> starts<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:09.050> course<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.649> we<00:02:10.070> are

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
it starts in the a of course if we are

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.950 
it starts in the a of course if we are
talking<00:02:10.250> about<00:02:10.429> alphabetical<00:02:11.090> order<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.510> it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
talking about alphabetical order and it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.440 
talking about alphabetical order and it
the<00:02:12.680> reason<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.340> starts<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.180> in

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the reason that it starts in the in

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.660 
the reason that it starts in the in
another<00:02:14.570> key<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.710> C<00:02:16.040> key<00:02:16.460> is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
another key that is not the C key is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.090 
another key that is not the C key is
because<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.540> note<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.440> always<00:02:18.800> used

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
because that note that is always used

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.400 
because that note that is always used
for<00:02:19.210> making<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.330> correct<00:02:20.630> pitch<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.110> any

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
for making the correct pitch in any

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.500 
for making the correct pitch in any
instrument<00:02:21.860> based<00:02:22.460> on<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.940> orchestral

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
instrument based on the orchestral

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.930 
instrument based on the orchestral
instruments<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.250> we're<00:02:25.400> going<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.670> start

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
instruments so here we're going to start

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.450 
instruments so here we're going to start
in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> C<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:27.230> can<00:02:27.260> understand<00:02:27.950> why<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
in the C so we can understand why in the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.610 
in the C so we can understand why in the
piano<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.180> way<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.080> central

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
piano is that way because it is central

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.730 
piano is that way because it is central
or<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.460> middle<00:02:31.760> note

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
or the middle note

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.190 
or the middle note
so<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.850> start<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.510> first<00:02:34.930> we're<00:02:35.080> going

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200

here the next note is the first one in
the<00:02:55.330> orchestra<00:02:55.600> pitch<00:02:57.120> which<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> be

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the orchestra pitch which is going to be

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.150 
the orchestra pitch which is going to be
the<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.670> next<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.240> be<00:03:01.420> B<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.160> here

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the a the next is going to be B and here

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.870 
the a the next is going to be B and here
after<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.030> B<00:03:04.180> we'll<00:03:04.390> start<00:03:04.690> again<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.650> C

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
after the B we'll start again in the C

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.170 
after the B we'll start again in the C
so<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:08.230> are<00:03:08.350> playing<00:03:08.620> both<00:03:09.010> CS<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.850> :

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
so we are playing both CS this is :

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.260 
so we are playing both CS this is :
octave<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:11.980> notice<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.820> when<00:03:13.120> we

if<00:04:12.690> we're<00:04:13.690> playing<00:04:13.930> from<00:04:14.290> ad<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:15.120> we<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.270> back

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
if we're playing from ad and we get back

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.039 
if we're playing from ad and we get back
it's<00:04:17.080> not<00:04:17.410> going<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.799> be<00:04:17.950> play<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.489> say<00:04:19.030> C<00:04:19.780> sharp

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
it's not going to be play I say C sharp

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.040 
it's not going to be play I say C sharp
is<00:04:20.140> going<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> be<00:04:20.530> play<00:04:20.739> as<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:21.070> D<00:04:21.450> flat<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.720> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
is going to be play as a D flat is the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.930 
is going to be play as a D flat is the
same<00:04:23.350> note<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.130> going<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.400> change<00:04:24.670> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
same note but it's going to change the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.810 
same note but it's going to change the
name<00:04:25.470> depending<00:04:26.470> on<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.710> structure<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.340> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
name depending on the structure of the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.730 
name depending on the structure of the
of<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.630> key<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.480> half<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.320> step<00:04:32.530> or

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
of the key so this is a half a step or

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.390 
of the key so this is a half a step or
have

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
have

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.460 
have
if<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.910> start<00:04:34.180> from<00:04:34.330> here<00:04:34.390> they<00:04:34.810> say<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.290> half

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
if we start from here they say the half

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.370 
if we start from here they say the half
step<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.130> next<00:04:36.400> white<00:04:36.730> key<00:04:37.000> but<00:04:37.870> if<00:04:38.140> we

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
step is the next white key but if we

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.110 
step is the next white key but if we
play<00:04:38.530> from<00:04:38.860> C<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.520> D<00:04:40.170> we're<00:04:41.170> passing<00:04:41.710> through

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
play from C to D we're passing through

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.660 
play from C to D we're passing through
two<00:04:43.120> half<00:04:43.360> steps<00:04:43.510> that's<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.350> whole<00:04:44.620> step<00:04:44.980> so

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
two half steps that's a whole step so

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.390 
two half steps that's a whole step so
when<00:04:45.880> we<00:04:46.090> are<00:04:46.140> when<00:04:47.140> we<00:04:47.290> say<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.740> we<00:04:47.890> play<00:04:48.100> one

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
when we are when we say that we play one

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.960 
when we are when we say that we play one

playing through two half steps if we're

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.960 
playing through two half steps if we're
in<00:04:55.930> G<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.890> want<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.160> play<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> whole<00:04:57.670> step

from G is going to be half a step and

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.720 
from G is going to be half a step and
have<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.790> step<00:05:01.090> this<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.550> if<00:05:03.550> we're

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
half a step and whole step so let's get
