00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.040
 new quality standards are not spelled out 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.050
 in one official document actually 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.580
 the absence of these standards allowed 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.769
 unfair manufacturer 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.940

 up to this point choosing oil 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.170
 consumers seem to have to rely 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.299
 on intuition and your own criteria 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.549
 qualities for example for a resident of Moscow 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.890
 carina most important place of production 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.120
 pay attention to the country of production 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.400
 because it is necessary to take the oil and where 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.480
 grow olives and produce and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.400
 It is considered that the highest quality 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.829
 production in greece and italy spain 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.900
 our experts recommend carefully 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.920
