00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 of minecraft because it does not hurt 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.400
 of time I have not proposed to you and that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 done a long time I get a lot of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.299
 messages whether it's on twitter on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 youtube in private message or on 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 return from minecraft and I propose you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 to resume a new adventure and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.859
 I need your help to find 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 the good words of once when we will have 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 found the right fashion and ben I you 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.380
 will often suggest videos 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.250
 on it so that's why I 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.649
 need you to help me find 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 because it makes me look 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.030
 known the judge could not run a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 capital and I must say that I have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 not known these goose rabbits either 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 I have not played for a long time 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 before it was double before and it happens 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 you did not see his particle finally I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.870
 was not necessarily a fan but there was 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 damon or corrections to support 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 on upper case but now we can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 do it by default but that's not the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.629
 question is that I will need 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.860
 of your help since you need better 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 know that me now that makes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 long time I have not played them 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 different modes that I'm going to list and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.410
 once I have found thanks to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 your support 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 most things and will be able to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.200
 start at that moment an adventure 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 together on the game so what does that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.320
 I would like to ask you there 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 you ask yourself me 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.619
 firstly I would like as I prefer 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.810
 wait for the weak and simon are because 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 that it is super strong the return of my 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.439
 voice because the sound of the game there is not 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.189
 great thing what I would like is a 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.710
 kind of survival game in a city 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.390
 rather topical by a stuff of moyaux 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the Middle Ages, even though I find it very 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 pretty it will be a news item in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.650
 which I should survive the day 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 with zombies 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.009
 so the classic zombies or maybe 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.689
 a mode with extra zombies 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.540
 and when it's dark like in a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.920
 field and a dea izay of I am a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.790
 legend makes the zombies at night 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.740
 become much more aggressive 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.659
 much more dangerous and so suddenly 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.070
 I will have to take shelter and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's to find myself a shelter from the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.270
 food and all that in maybe 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 in a big city or 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.829
 a small town with countryside and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.570
 houses so that's the first 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.490
 thing it will be a nice city where a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.189
 sympathetic villages so a map 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.259
 youth is super nice that a map 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.829
 really nice where I add the mode 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.340
 of shader as I had put before 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.229
 second thing 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 Well, why not a mode with 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 aggressive zombies at night maybe from 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.370
 the addition of two monsters also 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.080
 third mode what would not be bad 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.640
 some of the firearms even though that 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.410
 can denature minecraft I really 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.180
 want something survival or red 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
 look for shelter at night he found some 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.620
 guns in at places 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.310
 really the food survival stuff 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.560
 survival against zombies and 4th thing 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 what would that be me I do not know 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.819
 I think it's all about it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.560
 it's just like it was 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.910
 super simple but I think a map 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.650
 there is still a lot I'm 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.670
 remember a new york map or 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 stuff like that not 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.849
 systematically the same one another 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.129
 newer map you can me 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.170
 propose something that is current or 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.519
 with guns and if for example 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 we find in a medieval map 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.660
 with guns it will do a little 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 so weird with zombies that is 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.799
 dangerous more dangerous at night and the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.209
 day they're from anjou also 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.519
 but I can explore search for 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.120
 stuff so is there any other 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.980
 maybe bats 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 it's been a long time that's why 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.579
 actually make you an adventure do 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.260
 an adventure I prefer to do something 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.190
 really survive like that because 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.510
 minecraft it's been so long 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.780
 I did not play that I remember 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.340
 no more most of the same stuff 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.290
 the potions I do not know much about it 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.639
 in there and do something really 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.319
 classic I will not get there once 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.690

 if you really want to face the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.629
 minecraft because it really does 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.549
 this is one of the messages that i get the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.140
 more often there he offers you to 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.340
 high do but I need your 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.480

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.170
 little and I did not really find this 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.819
 which suited me 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.549
 but I must say that I do not have either 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.650
 searched for hours and hours 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.630
 and I think it will be everything I believe 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.160
 that's all how I change my mind 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.660

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.100

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.360
 a few weeks the time we find 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.580
 all this and I'll keep you informed 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.570
 once I 've found the right ones 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.320
 things and we can start 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.360
 ventured the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.580

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.750

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.340
 that a doubt I wanted to say to see

 tonight I'm going to do a little live I 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.260
 think at 18:30 to 18:30 forgiveness at 18h this 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.010
 evening h1n1 I think the royal battle mode 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.229
 because it's true that right now 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.460
 I love playing it a lot and there was 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.360
 another game maybe I wanted 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.340
 do but I know younger and more one 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.410
 we will be changed from a battle 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.440
 royal at 6 pm so always his and 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.120
 the ways of 15 points which is living with 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.190
 dailymotion reader and those who have 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 problems with dailymotion and 75 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.419
 009 on twitch so all the links are 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.830
 in the description and there may have 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.020
 no rebroadcast because when 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.150
 I recorded for the rebroadcast is 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.530
 well the game slows down a lot and that's 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.419
 not easy for me to play 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.800
 I know I do not think he'll have a right 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.449
 broadcast is why there is live 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.740
 on the real boat where 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 I did not record hesitated anyway 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.910
 a lot more fluid for me a lot 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.620
 more playable it's sad chorus it's 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.699
 sad it annoys me for those who can 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.050
 not watch the lives of not 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.400
 propose two reruns but I 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.280
 prefer to do that and still be able to 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.580
 to move without having difficulty 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.720
 shoot everywhere because that's where the 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.729
 toys an enemy I'm trying to move 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.930
 I can not be fluid so sorry there 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.300
 there may be no rebroadcast to 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.729
 part if I can get it back from 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.419
