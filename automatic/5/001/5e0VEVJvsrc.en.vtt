00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.700
 following the analysis of the forum renders 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.300
 a Caesar 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.710
 which he would have to train what 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.580
 You would have to train to be able to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.150
 adjust the work your left arm 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 would be to pay close attention to using the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 his left arm working with him on the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.500
 moment you're taking the racket 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.689
 what 's in this initial spin when you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 Home is doing what you are 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 making 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.550
 You 're leaving your left hand here. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.550
 and opening to the right 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.680
 at the time you start downloading racket 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 here you've been left hand up 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 when you're hitting the ball just a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 left your left arm is here and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 after you hit the ball you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 take care of your bar ending with the arm 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 left here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.230
 I mean you 're saying condemning your 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.320
 movement all its blow with the use of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.470
 your left arm's arms that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.450
 You would have to try and try. 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.689
 to use it in a proper way would be 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 so from here he takes the June racket 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.790
 When you got back here, you're going. 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 put your left arm 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.840
 parallel to the ground and parallel network that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.979
 position here look at that city 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890
 pointing to the sky 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.380
 at the time you started spinning 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.960
 body repair 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 it goes together it swirls together with right 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.630
 and you would end up holding with the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 racket here at the end 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.829
 then you would have to train to do this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:46.200
 move here, turn the beat and come here. 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.549
 it means good body money either 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 Tell me why you think you're knocking. 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.880
 front because his left arm is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 staying here 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 from the moment you leave the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.090
 Your left arm here is indifferent. 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.299
 how will you position your foot because 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 you turned as you put your foot in a 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.920
 scene and another one better explains 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.129
 incident would also have no problem 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.129
 arise the trunk do not repair spins 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 hit and end 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.280
 I mean that would be the one detail I 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.500
 wanted to work 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 it would be like working with your arm 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.880
 left now he will carry racket back 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.040
 forward 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:34.520
 It turns out ending with it here it's there it would be 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:41.530
 the work spins loose and the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:46.670
 movement spins loose ends movement 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.100
 spins loose on the move 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.870
 So you have to do a lot of work to 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.390
 you fix your left arm that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:01.870
 so the movement has to be 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.870
 coordinate 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 but it is very much this exercise
