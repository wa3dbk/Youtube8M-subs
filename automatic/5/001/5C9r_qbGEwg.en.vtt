 video I will teach you how to remove the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 browsing history of that phone 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 phone basically has a browser 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.150
 by default that is not simple that is the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 google what is this that is more serious than 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.330
 of critical in telecom in English but I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 I installed another browser that is very 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 interesting that it does not own but a mega 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.500
 it's called the opera mini is a browser 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 very complete and much better than the one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.629
 it brings by default that phone now 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.250
 before showing them how to eliminate the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.140
 browsing history I invite you to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 easily that where it says 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.629
 subscribe and in that way be at 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.670
 so much of my tree videos leaves me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.559
 comments questions or suggestions 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.650
 we go then here what is the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.300
 browser as are 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.270
 we started here I click to search 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.909
 already in this in this browser I have already 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 conducted several searches the only thing that 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.120
 we have to do is enter here by 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 more configuration 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.250
 here in configuration we look for the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 privacy option or it is usually 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.190
 here at hand delete caching remove 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.590
 history and we give you to accept that is 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.390
 a way to eliminate the history of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.670
 navigation and the other any much more 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.660
 simple is entering here above in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.980
 this little star thinking here where it says 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.860
 record 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.200
 in history what the configuration and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 eliminate history and so it's simple 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.530
 we have removed the history of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.610
 Default browser for this phone 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.950
 samsung ringleader 53 60 if we want 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 delete the history of this soon 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.370
 another application that I told them 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.310
 I recommend that also for that phone 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.820
 what is the mini lopera 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.820
 It is very simple 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.300
 we always just go here to what 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.450
 is what this circuit was a history 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.390
 and here is the option of success or 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.360
 we also go here the little circle settings 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.190
 and we look for the option of privacy in 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.290
 privacy is usually always the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.320
 option to empty history the voice in the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.050
 x we give and we will go back to say 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.310
 effectively returned the record as 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.500
 they were the story is completely 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.180
 empty basically that's all for 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.430
