almost threw up on their leg day and the
reality<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.010> whole<00:00:44.219> concept<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
reality is the whole concept of that is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.330 
reality is the whole concept of that is
so<00:00:45.510> ridiculous

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
so ridiculous

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
so ridiculous
because<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.579> getting<00:00:47.820> sore<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.570> you're

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because if you're getting sore or you're

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
because if you're getting sore or you're
getting<00:00:48.840> Dom's<00:00:49.460> regularly<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.730> any<00:00:50.969> sort<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
getting Dom's regularly from any sort of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
getting Dom's regularly from any sort of
training<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> you've<00:00:52.170> been<00:00:52.410> lifting<00:00:52.649> more

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
training and you've been lifting more

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.229 
training and you've been lifting more
than<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.370> six<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> eight<00:00:54.000> weeks

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
than about six to eight weeks

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
than about six to eight weeks
consistently<00:00:55.050> there's<00:00:55.860> probably<00:00:56.280> something

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
consistently there's probably something

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
consistently there's probably something
wrong<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.270> program<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.649> we

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
wrong with your program and what we

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
wrong with your program and what we
usually<00:00:58.920> find<00:00:59.390> with<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> leg<00:01:01.140> day

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
usually find with things like a leg day

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.130 
usually find with things like a leg day
because<00:01:01.620> you're<00:01:01.770> training<00:01:02.070> legs<00:01:02.280> once<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> week

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
because you're training legs once a week

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
because you're training legs once a week
once<00:01:04.140> every<00:01:04.350> five<00:01:04.860> days<00:01:05.250> four<00:01:05.670> days<00:01:05.700> depending

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
once every five days four days depending

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
once every five days four days depending
on<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.450> sort<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> split<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:07.500> running

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
on what sort of split you're running

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
on what sort of split you're running
you're<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.820> training<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.450> frequently

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you're not training them frequently

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
you're not training them frequently
enough<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.470> that's<00:01:10.650> contributing<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.369> Dom's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
enough so that's contributing to Dom's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
enough so that's contributing to Dom's
infrequent<00:01:12.360> training<00:01:12.780> contributes<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> Dom's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
infrequent training contributes to Dom's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
infrequent training contributes to Dom's
and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.100> most<00:01:14.340> guys<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> tram<00:01:15.180> sort

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and then most guys because the tram sort

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.580 
and then most guys because the tram sort
of<00:01:15.479> frequently<00:01:15.840> they're<00:01:16.049> coming<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.439> they're

of frequently they're coming in they're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640 
of frequently they're coming in they're
doing<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.950> 15<00:01:17.670> sets<00:01:18.170> they'll<00:01:19.170> come<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.560> and

steroid<00:02:52.390> user<00:02:53.160> doesn't<00:02:54.160> use<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.880> much<00:02:55.300> gear

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
steroid user doesn't use that much gear

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.120 
steroid user doesn't use that much gear
compared<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> lot<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.800> guys<00:02:56.950> that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
compared to a lot of the guys that

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.090 
compared to a lot of the guys that
you're<00:02:57.250> thinking<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.640> through<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.850> massive<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you're thinking of through a massive and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.710 
you're thinking of through a massive and
so<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.160> start<00:03:00.610> combining<00:03:00.760> their<00:03:01.180> genetics<00:03:01.600> or

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
so you start combining their genetics or

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.300 
so you start combining their genetics or
the<00:03:01.780> high<00:03:01.900> drug<00:03:02.140> doses<00:03:02.500> they<00:03:02.650> get<00:03:02.830> away<00:03:03.010> with

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
the high drug doses they get away with

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.449 
the high drug doses they get away with
this<00:03:03.700> infrequent<00:03:04.390> leg<00:03:04.600> training<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.459> it's

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
this infrequent leg training and it's

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.400 
this infrequent leg training and it's
not<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.030> work<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.660> vast<00:03:07.840> majority

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
not going to work for the vast majority

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.410 
not going to work for the vast majority
of<00:03:08.440> people<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.580> whole<00:03:09.730> concept<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.300> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
of people and so this whole concept of a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.470 
of people and so this whole concept of a
leg<00:03:10.690> day<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.459> itself<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.269> causes

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
leg day is in and of itself what causes

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.449 
leg day is in and of itself what causes
people<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.140> dom's<00:03:14.380> were<00:03:14.709> throwing<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.280> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
people that dom's were throwing up and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.930 
people that dom's were throwing up and
it<00:03:15.549> ultimately<00:03:15.700> leads<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:17.670> inferior<00:03:18.670> leg

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
it ultimately leads to inferior leg

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.180 
it ultimately leads to inferior leg
development<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.690> really<00:03:20.290> want<00:03:20.650> amazing

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
development if you really want amazing

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.569 
development if you really want amazing
legs<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:22.480> should<00:03:22.660> probably<00:03:22.870> be<00:03:23.829> squatting<00:03:24.250> or

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
legs you should probably be squatting or

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.069 
legs you should probably be squatting or
doing<00:03:24.850> some<00:03:25.120> sort<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.450> deadlift<00:03:25.959> but

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
doing some sort of deadlift but

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.800 
doing some sort of deadlift but
