00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.810
 I have 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.969
 after 17:00 the workers are almost complete 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.320
 already have his first turks trust 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.320
 won't prove rows and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.910
 in the ministry of transport offered both 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.160
 save on road construction 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.350
 ministries are confident of reducing the maximum 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.970
 design speed for roads under construction 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.370
 will reduce the cost of travel 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.590
 the quality of the canvas will not be affected 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.890
 now for example on the section of the highway m4 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.850
 Don 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.950
 used in the construction of 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.739
 modern road technologies should 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.260
 surrender 2016 and then the path from Moscow 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.500
 to Rostov will be faster and more comfortable 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.510
 Reporting Alexander Lebanon speed 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.090
 freeway is cooked like puff cake 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.860
 sand dunes pressed by rollers afterwards 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.540
 they will bring rubble here 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.339
 three layers to lay asphalt on 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.930
 such technologies build autobahns in 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.610
 Germany does not save on materials 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.290
 builders assurance this road 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.080
 last at least a quarter of a century 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.600
 Iâ€™ll survive for a long time and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.120
 she will survive me they said so she 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.670
 will not survive because in steam we are about it 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.860
 we keep seals and how 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.540
 see two rollers if there is 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.490
 seal then one by one will stand 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 A thousand years the task of builders to pass the object 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.090
 to the beginning of the year 16 but it is possible that this 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 the road will be ready 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.899
 ahead of time without compromising quality in 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.670
 otherwise, the contractor will bear 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.740
 losses that's why to work 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.200
 attracted only highly qualified 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.030
 Nikolai Kuznetsov's staff 28 years 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 Drives the grader now to master 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.310
 new technology 3d navigation mode gps 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.950
 Essentially in this booth work two driver 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.200
 and the computer here the machine raised the blade itself 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.619
 and all I'm not doing anything back food 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.439
 everything 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.869
 the mechanic is practically driving 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.090
 only machines and the rest everything works 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.350
 from the satellite everything goes carousel of heavy 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.990
 trucks running around the clock 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.409
 mode besides the road builder itself 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.179
 plots in 29 kilometers are building another 16 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 artificial structures moving to 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.820
 agricultural passage techniques for migration 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.369
 of animals 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.899
 multi-level junction every 50 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.460
 meters will be installed masts 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.770
 artificial lighting one of 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.110
 plots of the new route will pass above the ground 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.380
 Now wiki bridge is working on mounting 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.069
 overpass they have to connect together 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 120 tons of iron 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.730
 and then this framework will need to be more 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.650
 pour concrete after putting in 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.270
 operation of this section of the highway m-4 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 don get from moscow to rostov and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 further south can be much faster 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.180
 this will be possible thanks to a crawl 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.200
 two settlements of Voronezh 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.680
 areas of new usman 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.299
 and rosary horns where in 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.670
 Start Noah season were always jams 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.200
 the bypass will be 4 lanes per project 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.849
 enters in parallel and erection 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.099
 related infrastructure 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.359
 it's about roadside service at least 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.909
 50 parking for cars 30 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.709
 for freight it is a huge parking that 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:57.530
 just unfortunately not enough for 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.560
 roads there and children's rooms there and 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.569
 laundress and of course the request and the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.859
 important moment building safety 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.109
 on the high-speed sections will be on duty 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.519
 emergency commissioners if necessary 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.799
 they will be ready to render the first 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.510
 medical assistance to deliver the driver to 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.040
 the nearest gas station will help 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.659
 tow a faulty car 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.519
 alexander ivanov andrey merchants alexander 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.269
 Dudik Dmitri Ovchinnikov and Mikhail Noise 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.200
 to lead 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.200
 Voronezh region
