talk about is Abdullah which is really

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.820 
talk about is Abdullah which is really
important<00:00:14.130> because<00:00:14.450> when<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.719> delete<00:00:16.260> an<00:00:16.470> app

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
important because when you delete an app

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.410 
important because when you delete an app
normally<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.580> drag<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
normally you just drag it into the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830 
normally you just drag it into the
regular<00:00:18.720> trash<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.210> now<00:00:21.210> delete<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.600> app

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
regular trash can and now delete the app

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
regular trash can and now delete the app
but<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> lot<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> program<00:00:23.430> files<00:00:23.699> will

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
but a lot of the program files will

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
but a lot of the program files will
still<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
still be there so what you do when you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
still be there so what you do when you
want<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.859> delete<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.310> app<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.760> drag<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.180> into

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
want to delete an app you drag it into

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
want to delete an app you drag it into
here<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.019> deletes<00:00:28.320> everything<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:29.160> has

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.580 
here and it deletes everything that has
to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> app<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.960> after<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to do with the app and then after that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
to do with the app and then after that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
on startup because it's kind of annoying

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
on startup because it's kind of annoying
because<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.629> makes<00:00:51.870> everything<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
because it just makes everything really

slow makes my internet really slow every

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
slow makes my internet really slow every
time<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> turn<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.800> turn<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.309> my<00:00:56.399> computer<00:00:56.600> so

time I turn up turn on my computer so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
time I turn up turn on my computer so
this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

and then I'll be like where I have to
move<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:49.860> mouse<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> normal

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
move my mouse to get it back to normal

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
move my mouse to get it back to normal
so<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.930> hit<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> copper

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so this you hit it and it's the copper

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
so this you hit it and it's the copper
cup<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> coffee<00:01:53.790> steaming<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.200> won't<00:01:55.350> let

cup of coffee steaming and it won't let

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
cup of coffee steaming and it won't let
your<00:01:55.560> screen<00:01:55.890> dim<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
your screen dim on you so that's a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.580 
your screen dim on you so that's a
