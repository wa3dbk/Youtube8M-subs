00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 hi guys kharlan are welcome on 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.270
 confucius for this new video I tell you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.109
 immediately that if today they are soft quiet 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.449
 calm 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.640
 I don't do brambilla surpassing things 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.250
 style simply because it's late 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.890
 boys is late and almost 120 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 however, today I lost a lot of time 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.219
 behind then a video of editing 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 don't smash everything that will have as yours 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.329
 usually from the powerful editing that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.370
 however , to get this out 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 week however I didn't want to leave you a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 another day without video and dispute here 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.570
 instead a fast video fast video though 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 interesting in my opinion for everyone 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 those who started playing from 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 little about dirty bombs are there to leaders 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.789
 a club today we will speak indeed also 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 how our money to sea 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.250
 on this fantastic exact exact fps 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 not only will we also see how to spend it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
 that is, that you want more from life and then 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 I will answer any questions whatsoever 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 are always the usual that you make me TV is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 a free to play is a free to play lo 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 will always or when it ends 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.979
 beta does not end ends sail unfold 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.630
 we curse is like an access 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 anticipated adequate access way 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.689
 anticipated jadu pixel however I write 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.090
 Early access must be made from this 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.740
 here is a beta but simply that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.270
 they go beta because they don't consider a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.890
 game done is over a way let's say for 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.110
 ass your ass because they are the draw ones 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.970
 defect to a beautiful is written here no 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.430
 probably also consider beta is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.650
 now the game is current because not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 it includes all the merz's still there 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.479
 not all of them have been implemented 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.149
 there are 12 13 already but it will come to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.549
 20 and more I think I'm game and fantastic 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.979
 what I tell you is then basic mechanics 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.049
 the fundamentals followed throughout the video 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.140
 interesting because the first the first 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.180
 fundamental that you catch is in a is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.670
 that you see here there are three 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.060
 missions that are regenerated every three hours 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 see here looking for enter 39 minutes yes 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 regenerates 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.310
 then how these emissions work 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.290
 they are your main business ie 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 he hates us not paying attention you have to do them 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 where to make at least two a day that is two 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 files per day so out of six in total 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.160
 because they bring you are and we say precisely 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 and the things that bring you the most money 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.940
 see it says a lot very simple 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.680
 easy we shouldn't even explain it to you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.060
 what you have to do for example for 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.970
 complete this thousand to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.950
 missions are either 500 to 758 thousand e 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.989
 then obscured here he pecked more from 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.360
 one the other that I have completed is not me 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.819
 I remember from what it was but still this 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.670
 is then it is very simple see you have to 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.620
 play six match in objective mod 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.989
 there are two modes at the end guys 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.549
 for now because that other former equity with 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.560
 a I remember what it's called yet not 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.959
 it was still indeed can play and then 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.269
 see this other I have to play five 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.090
 play with fragger in my team e 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.250
 can act becomes because many of you 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.080
 they think you have to enter non- server e 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.569
 play with someone in the team 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.940
 have between car no no but cabbage 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.489
 that is, you have to take fragger you take it 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.920
 vacua you drag it but I put it in the car 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 team then it is not said that you should 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.269
 use in game but must stay in the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.040
 let's put your roster like that or up 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.980
 a crap first immediately little instant 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 big has me some kids not invested 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.130
 you only get cash at the cash desk 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.739
 in that place and must be stopped momentarily on 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.329
 artforum can hate you see why not 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.489
 you have to buy the boxes for your profits 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.650
 superbly useless fuck then to the tra 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.030
 these are other missions that are 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500
 the ideas the mission that is that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.850
 daily that are three 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.799
 basically in theory they should 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.600
 be four though now that the other 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.569
 mode as I have already explained is offline 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.389
 Ã¨ they are only three or the first game 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.150
 of the day you play in stop loss and in 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.120
 250 activities for each of these 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.950
 then 500 grappa the easiest i 500 e 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.600
 then the first game to win the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.489
 day gives you an additional 500 then 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.500
 let's say that if you play a little sener given 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.980
 a little bit an hour and a half two 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.159
 you can make yourself with a lot of possibilities 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.480
 5000 6000 a stuff like that 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.620
 then there are other methods for making i 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.389
 money faster 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.880
 or for example by activating the booster 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.739
 I tried it but it is not convenient 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.470
 it is convenient because it simply doubles 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.509
 the points you make in game at the points and you do 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.449
 king are very few if doubled 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.070
 here are the issues of emissions 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.930
 it would really be true but not so 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.000
 struggles states it is clear I made more money 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.250
 and meanwhile I would be wondering how 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.870
 i have all this cash back i should 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.330
 know that I lost a cobram bet 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.389
 b we practically did an opening 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.580
 cases one against the other that I never have 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.199
 published because we were like this 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.940
 losers we lost ten boxes 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.400
 obviously we can find he found it 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.320
 three iron you have got buzz lost not 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.870
 could spend the money earned on 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.639
 of the team bob the fake ones obviously if 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.820
 second aviary we are in place a 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.590
 I'm 366 thousand and couldn't spend it 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.900
 for a month then I accumulated if i 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.150
 money now I will not spend that I will buy gods 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.070
 merson or maybe I think of myself as a treasure 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.539
 I don't know how to make it cool enough before 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.580
 close guys i wanted you to see 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.449
 how is this game in my opinion is not 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.250
 a fart win 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.139
 indeed, it does not need nor a fart wind 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.180
 it never will be unless they change 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.560
 who knows what politics is something I have 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.060
 already mentioned in other videos 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.830
 but I never explained it to you then it is 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.960
 obvious that in the store there are 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.370
 things you can buy even with money 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.470
 true there is also something for the truth 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.389
 who can only buy with real money 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.340
 in this case the elite kate ma 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.740
 basically you're buying them 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.830
 skin because I'll explain if you go the 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.960
 load out see all the cards 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.539
 with those with three skills we talk about 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.070
 those with treaties available to 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.830
 every merz 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.680
 ok of every merck you see for example aura 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.990
 chan 9 cards but everyone knows 9 non cards 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.210
 there are exactly nine months 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.180
 now here are the bronze ones and 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.120
 you can buy them with real money 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.849
 you see 3 euros and 49 that with the cash that 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.860
 ingame 17,500 go here bought 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.070
 what you want what you need to understand is 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.310
 that the bronze cards are the same as the 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.740
 cards silver gold and cobalt there is only the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.620
 that is, each of each category 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.110
 silver bronze 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.030
 cobalt gold the same cards exist and 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.400
 access to those bronze is bullshit 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.350
 because you can give it very easily 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.229
 or come to the place you buy here 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.740
 then the elite kate giving you access 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.050
 much more easily to a silver skin 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.180
 cobalt gold ie it gives you a skin because 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.370
 then the same card also exists of 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.440
 bronze you got a bat but me 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.449
 I think so in short so I want to 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.919
 at the end when we talk about a character who 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.600
 it has certain characteristics ie 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.490
 those jokes to that paraphernalia that is 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.800
 in the bronze one is equivalent to that 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.380
 silver to gold that of 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.570
 cobalt cia now male and more unlucky 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.699
 but who cares about the important no and 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.760
 smashing opponents and even how 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.440
 they reason with the credit booster 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.630
 come back a moment is great because 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.940
 them that the programmers say not 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.639
 give the chance like many others on 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.949
 play happens to simply convert 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.800
 the real money in cash of the game I am 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:15.720
 member 10 euros that give 50 thousand I do 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.990
 the operation does the same thing again 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.849
 but not here the booster and it gives you more or 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.800
 less money depending on how good you are 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:24.389
 you because you can make it yield a 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.710
 certainly a better player than 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.840
 it obviously makes you more fruitful 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.590
 because it simply doubles credits 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.570
 what are you doing 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.580
 playing I hope this video has been there 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.139
 of help maybe yes maybe we don't get caught 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.419
 the next let me know if you are 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.340
 playing dirty bombs which pg you like 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.169
 which less to break down than comments I'm 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.310
 video really bears let me hear that 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.310
