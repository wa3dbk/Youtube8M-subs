00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you can accent when Tiana sixteen oceans

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.370 
you can accent when Tiana sixteen oceans
consisted<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> 1e<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.450> within<00:01:27.450> those<00:01:27.750> money

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
consisted of 1e and within those money

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.100 
consisted of 1e and within those money
and<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.610> normally<00:01:30.060> playing<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.840> we're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and we are normally playing like we're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
and we are normally playing like we're
accident<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> 1<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.430> means<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
accident to 1 which means that if you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.530 
accident to 1 which means that if you
want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> sounds<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.100> displacement

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
want to to this sounds like displacement

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
want to to this sounds like displacement
and<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.930> those<00:01:37.049> people<00:01:37.259> who<00:01:37.470> definitely<00:01:38.040> have

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and for those people who definitely have

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.620 
and for those people who definitely have
metronome<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> best<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> work

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
metronome this is the best thing to work

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.730 
metronome this is the best thing to work
out<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.140> starting<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.560> for

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
out with just starting off for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
out with just starting off for
fundamentals<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.640> displace<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
fundamentals is you can displace the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.539 
fundamentals is you can displace the
accident<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.340> but<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> one

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.310 

so<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.329> thing<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.229> bit

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so for this thing this is a little bit

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.000 
so for this thing this is a little bit
more<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.680> guess<00:01:52.710> pushing<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> button

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.890 

to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> left<00:02:02.820> field<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.240> come<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:03.720> without

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
to the left field to come back without

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.240 
to the left field to come back without
taking<00:02:04.410> away<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> box<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.130> I'll

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
taking away from the box so I'll

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.370
