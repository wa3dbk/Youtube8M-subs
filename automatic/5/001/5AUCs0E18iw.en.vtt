00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
then depending on what browser you're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
then depending on what browser you're
using<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.560> should<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> Downloads

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
using it should be in the Downloads

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
using it should be in the Downloads
folder<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.420> you'll<00:01:16.170> notice<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.740> no

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

folder and you'll notice that it's no
zip<00:01:17.159> format<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.119> means<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
zip format so what this means is that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880 
zip format so what this means is that
you're<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.650> something

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you're going to have to use something

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.429 
you're going to have to use something
like<00:01:20.040> astro<00:01:20.640> file<00:01:20.880> manager<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.840> unzip<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
like astro file manager to unzip that

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.649 
like astro file manager to unzip that
file<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.580> order<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> contents<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
file in order for the contents to be

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
file in order for the contents to be
read<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.049> ultimate<00:01:25.710> custom<00:01:26.070> widget<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.299> once

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
read by ultimate custom widget so once

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.730 
read by ultimate custom widget so once
that's<00:01:27.720> done<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> our
