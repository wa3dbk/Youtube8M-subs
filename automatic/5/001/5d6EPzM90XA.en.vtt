00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that maps here today and to me and fell

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.840 
that maps here today and to me and fell
pretty<00:00:21.060> big<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.550> either<00:00:23.550> answer

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
pretty big I have to see either answer

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
pretty big I have to see either answer
to<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> old<00:00:24.359> drops<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.350> don't<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.680> if

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to the old drops but I don't know if

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740 
to the old drops but I don't know if
it's<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> cause<00:00:26.130> may<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.369> easy<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.390> scale<00:00:27.720> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's the cause may be easy the scale of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.029 
it's the cause may be easy the scale of
everything's<00:00:28.349> bigger<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
everything's bigger because the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.380 
everything's bigger because the
character<00:00:29.429> models<00:00:29.730> bigger<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> bowling

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
character models bigger the bowling

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.100 
character models bigger the bowling
balls<00:00:30.539> bigger<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> mean<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.989> think<00:00:33.989> maybe

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
balls bigger but I mean I think maybe

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
balls bigger but I mean I think maybe
there<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> maybe<00:00:34.770> less<00:00:35.100> routes<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.180> but

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
there is maybe less routes to go but

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
there is maybe less routes to go but
there's<00:00:37.290> several<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.399> elevated

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
there's several a lot more elevated

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.299 
there's several a lot more elevated
level<00:00:39.989> changes<00:00:40.469> compared<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> old

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
level changes compared to the old

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.420 
level changes compared to the old
Ghostfreak<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.910> these<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> could<00:00:44.399> you

them Italy yeah so with the terms of the
scale<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> maps<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> mentioned

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
scale the maps that's what you mentioned

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
scale the maps that's what you mentioned
about<00:00:53.579> pacing<00:00:53.820> right<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.719> being<00:00:54.960> too

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
about pacing right and about being too

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.450 
about pacing right and about being too
running<00:00:55.440> down<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> being<00:00:55.829> too<00:00:56.010> fast<00:00:56.219> pace

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
running down and being too fast pace

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.619 
running down and being too fast pace
it's<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> reasons<00:00:57.059> why<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.539> decided

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it's one of the reasons why we decided

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.680 
it's one of the reasons why we decided
to<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.079> 66<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:59.370> because<00:01:00.120> basically<00:01:00.829> one<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
to go 66 right because basically one the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
to go 66 right because basically one the
one<00:01:03.690> airplane<00:01:03.960> 88<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> too

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
one airplane 88 it was just kind of too

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
one airplane 88 it was just kind of too
much<00:01:05.640> tails<00:01:06.060> too<00:01:06.570> difficult<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> communicate

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
much tails too difficult to communicate

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.660 
much tails too difficult to communicate
with<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.650> teammates<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.340> started<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
with your teammates and we started to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.830 
with your teammates and we started to
lose<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.060> empathy<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> make

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
lose some empathy that we want to make

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.919 
lose some empathy that we want to make
as<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.170> game<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.649> lot<00:01:11.799> of<00:01:11.829> that<00:01:12.100> kind<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.929> slow

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
as a game and a lot of that kind of slow

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.599 
as a game and a lot of that kind of slow
pace<00:01:14.140> experiences<00:01:14.799> will<00:01:15.009> face<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.369> cool

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
pace experiences will face a cool

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.910 
pace experiences will face a cool
experience<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.149> we<00:01:16.240> decided<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:16.719> to<00:01:16.780> 66<00:01:17.380> is

two there to be animated pipeline that's

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.469 
two there to be animated pipeline that's
our<00:01:28.000> smallest<00:01:28.270> map<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:28.810> mill<00:01:29.289> was<00:01:29.439> our

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
our smallest map and mill was our

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.240 
our smallest map and mill was our
compared<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.569> the<00:01:31.659> other<00:01:31.810> drawn<00:01:32.049> map<00:01:32.289> Mills<00:01:33.039> is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
compared to the other drawn map Mills is

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.699 
compared to the other drawn map Mills is
only<00:01:33.429> maybe<00:01:33.759> 250<00:01:34.329> meters<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.229> really<00:01:35.439> not

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
only maybe 250 meters so it's really not

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.190 
only maybe 250 meters so it's really not

because<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.609> lighting<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.269> kind<00:02:19.660> of

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
because the the lighting is kind of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.470 
because the the lighting is kind of

lighting<00:02:22.810> something<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.470> had<00:02:23.560> take

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
lighting something that we had take

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.020 
lighting something that we had take
account<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.250> all<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.489> time<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:24.970> not

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
something that we change on the wind so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.979 
something that we change on the wind so
basically<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.060> lighting<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.540> very

basically the lighting is a very

it<00:03:04.030> was<00:03:04.150> key<00:03:04.359> from<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.719> start<00:03:04.989> because

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it was key from the start because

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.440 
it was key from the start because

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the weather effects of were like at a

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.729 
the weather effects of were like at a

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
lighting feller but now you see I

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.409 
lighting feller but now you see I
brought<00:03:11.920> things<00:03:12.219> much<00:03:12.430> more<00:03:12.579> visceral<00:03:12.790> into

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
brought things much more visceral into

brought things much more visceral into
the<00:03:13.569> environment<00:03:14.609> yes<00:03:15.609> is<00:03:16.329> very<00:03:16.540> important<00:03:17.079> to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the environment yes is very important to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.789 
the environment yes is very important to
us<00:03:17.470> especially<00:03:17.829> because<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.500> game<00:03:20.500> right

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
us especially because it's a game right

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.190 
us especially because it's a game right
when<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.180> covers<00:03:22.480> light<00:03:22.629> out<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.989> feel<00:03:23.169> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
when the covers light out can feel a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.309 
when the covers light out can feel a
little<00:03:23.379> bit<00:03:23.590> gamey<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.209> went<00:03:25.840> into<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.139> lot

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
little bit gamey so we went into a lot

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.440 
little bit gamey so we went into a lot
of<00:03:26.469> extra<00:03:26.799> happy<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.459> make<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.879> environmental

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
of extra happy to make the environmental

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.670 
of extra happy to make the environmental
effects<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.989> think<00:03:29.319> they're<00:03:29.439> talking<00:03:29.650> about

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
effects I think they're talking about

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.289 
effects I think they're talking about
with<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:29.950> particles<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.579> dust<00:03:30.730> control

with the particles and dust control

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.240 
with the particles and dust control
agents<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.079> feel<00:03:32.260> very<00:03:32.530> very<00:03:32.739> real<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.189> you

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
agents to feel very very real so you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.190 
agents to feel very very real so you
still<00:03:33.489> immersed<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.049> ghost

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
still immersed because it's a ghost

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.440
