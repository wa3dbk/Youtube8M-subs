against<00:01:25.180> Bedales<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.979> tackled<00:01:26.979> him<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.280> he's

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
against Bedales I tackled him and he's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.039 
against Bedales I tackled him and he's
going<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.820> other<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.630> just

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
going the other way and I just

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.080 
going the other way and I just
understand<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.189> even<00:01:30.369> full<00:01:30.640> dependently<00:01:31.030> I

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
understand and even full dependently I

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.789 
understand and even full dependently I
went<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.479> right<00:01:31.869> way<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.350> didn't<00:01:32.590> save<00:01:32.770> it

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
went the right way and it didn't save it

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.679 
went the right way and it didn't save it
so<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.850> all<00:01:33.939> going<00:01:34.150> against<00:01:34.390> her<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.600> this

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
so it's all going against her in this

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.999 
so it's all going against her in this
game<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:37.090> header<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.439> floor<00:01:38.740> to

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
game and then a header on the floor to

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.170
