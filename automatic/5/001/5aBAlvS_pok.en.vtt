got wet with it but the other
interesting<00:01:07.820> thing<00:01:08.360> was<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.720> concept<00:01:09.289> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
interesting thing was the concept a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:23.469 
interesting thing was the concept a

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
foliar feeding and they end up but

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.779 
foliar feeding and they end up but
there's<00:01:23.780> some<00:01:23.959> reason<00:01:24.349> Athens<00:01:24.830> she<00:01:25.399> noticed

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.270 
pouring that solution into it it takes a
little<00:04:09.060> while<00:04:09.269> going<00:04:09.630> through<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.709> whatever

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
little while going through and whatever

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.000 
little while going through and whatever
you<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.120> bottom<00:04:12.350> then<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.709> fill

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
you have in the bottom then just fill

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.880 
you have in the bottom then just fill
that

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.330 
that
with<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:16.180> rest<00:04:16.420> with<00:04:16.690> water<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> top<00:04:17.709> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
with the rest with water to the top and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.710 
with the rest with water to the top and
you'll<00:04:18.549> have<00:04:18.700> enough<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.090> last<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.480> for<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
you'll have enough to last you for the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.370 
you'll have enough to last you for the
season

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
season

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.040 
season
Eustace<00:04:21.340> Braverman<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:21.880> off<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.360> go<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.930> I

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
Eustace Braverman and off you go and I

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.360 
Eustace Braverman and off you go and I
and<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.620> use<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:25.360> spray<00:04:25.980> leaves<00:04:26.980> with

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
and I use that I can spray leaves with

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.240 
and I use that I can spray leaves with
it<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.880> also<00:04:28.450> went<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.960> moving<00:04:29.590> something<00:04:30.010> from

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
it I also went to moving something from

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.270 
it I also went to moving something from
the<00:04:30.610> garden<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.270> want<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.630> say<00:04:31.960> crazy<00:04:32.950> that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
the garden that I want to say crazy that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640 
the garden that I want to say crazy that
way<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.760> don't<00:04:34.330> like<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.990> bring<00:04:35.169> things<00:04:35.410> into

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
way I don't like to bring things into

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.350 
way I don't like to bring things into
the<00:04:35.919> greenhouse<00:04:36.130> without<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:37.000> will<00:04:37.150> check

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
the greenhouse without that will check

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.030 
the greenhouse without that will check
them<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:37.720> I'll<00:04:37.840> blast<00:04:38.169> them<00:04:38.530> with<00:04:38.590> something

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
them so I'll blast them with something

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.350 
them so I'll blast them with something
like<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.520> before

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
like that before

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.810 
like that before
write<00:04:40.570> down<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.960> may<00:04:41.110> be<00:04:41.230> taken<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.710> roots<00:04:42.010> and

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
write down I may be taken in roots and

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.370 
write down I may be taken in roots and
just<00:04:42.850> take<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.330> whole<00:04:43.510> root<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.260> just

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
just take in a whole root so it's just

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.340 
just take in a whole root so it's just
totally<00:04:45.370> cleaned<00:04:45.669> out<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.690> which<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.050> never

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
totally cleaned out and which I never

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.750 
totally cleaned out and which I never
would<00:04:47.560> have<00:04:47.590> done<00:04:47.800> before<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.430> don't<00:04:48.640> want

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
would have done before but I don't want

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.190 
would have done before but I don't want
any<00:04:48.970> extra<00:04:49.270> borrowings<00:04:50.020> I

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.370
