don't<00:03:56.519> cry<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:57.599> it's<00:03:57.719> a<00:03:57.780> very<00:03:57.959> natural

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
don't cry but it's a very natural

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.530 
don't cry but it's a very natural
release<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.010> emotion<00:03:59.459> when<00:03:59.579> you've<00:03:59.790> been<00:04:00.090> in

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
release of emotion when you've been in

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.009 
release of emotion when you've been in

crisis and you've been extremely anxious

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.199 
crisis and you've been extremely anxious
it's<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.260> natural<00:04:04.739> thing<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:05.219> do<00:04:05.370> afterwards<00:04:05.939> is

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
it's a natural thing to do afterwards is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.179 
it's a natural thing to do afterwards is
to<00:04:06.599> cry<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> release<00:04:07.439> all<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.650> emotion

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
to cry to release all that emotion

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.770 
to cry to release all that emotion
that's<00:04:08.310> been<00:04:08.459> bubbling<00:04:08.760> away<00:04:08.939> inside<00:04:09.419> and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that's been bubbling away inside and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.349 
that's been bubbling away inside and
they<00:04:10.349> they<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.859> save<00:04:11.099> face<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.150> safe

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
they they can save face and in the safe

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.119 
they they can save face and in the safe
space<00:04:12.510> they<00:04:12.870> don't<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.379> to<00:04:13.560> do<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:13.949> front

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
space they don't have to do it in front

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
of all those and again that behavior

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.089 
of all those and again that behavior
would<00:04:17.370> escalate<00:04:17.699> before<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.419> would<00:04:18.570> continue

would escalate before it would continue

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.349 
would escalate before it would continue
because<00:04:20.099> they<00:04:20.220> didn't<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.120> way

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
because they didn't have that way

the classroom but even then you've still

the classroom but even then you've still

when they're in the safe space they're

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.550 
when they're in the safe space they're

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
they can do what they want and there's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.149 
they can do what they want and there's
no<00:04:33.300> judgement<00:04:33.750> being<00:04:33.930> made<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.349> them<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.919> by

no judgement being made of them and by

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.860 
no judgement being made of them and by
the<00:04:35.220> time<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.759> come<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:36.120> they<00:04:36.659> know

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the time they come out they know

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.340 
the time they come out they know
themselves<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.620> they're<00:04:38.039> actually<00:04:38.340> calm

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.580 

I<00:04:42.440> found<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:43.940> children<00:04:44.600> who<00:04:45.080> have

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I found that the the children who have

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.730 
I found that the the children who have
nonverbal<00:04:46.520> communication<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:48.110> some<00:04:48.530> ways

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
nonverbal communication in some ways

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.780 
nonverbal communication in some ways
I've<00:04:49.420> accepted<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.720> safe<00:04:50.930> space<00:04:51.250> much<00:04:52.250> faster

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
I've accepted the safe space much faster

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.880 
I've accepted the safe space much faster
and<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.120> think<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.720> key<00:04:53.900> thing<00:04:54.170> there<00:04:54.380> is<00:04:54.650> there

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
and I think the key thing there is there

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.700 
and I think the key thing there is there
is<00:04:54.920> no<00:04:55.370> stimulus<00:04:56.000> in<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.360> room<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.500> those

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
is no stimulus in that room and so those

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.460 
is no stimulus in that room and so those
children<00:04:58.190> once<00:04:58.490> they<00:04:58.610> realized<00:04:59.330> how<00:04:59.990> calm

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
children once they realized how calm

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.900 
children once they realized how calm
quiet<00:05:01.280> peaceful<00:05:02.440> low<00:05:03.440> stimulus<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.340> environ

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
quiet peaceful low stimulus that environ

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.530 
quiet peaceful low stimulus that environ
was<00:05:05.150> very<00:05:05.840> quickly<00:05:06.200> chose<00:05:06.950> to<00:05:07.880> use<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.180> symbol

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
was very quickly chose to use the symbol

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
was very quickly chose to use the symbol
to<00:05:08.690> go<00:05:08.840> there<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:10.640> sometimes<00:05:11.510> would<00:05:11.960> actually

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
to go there and sometimes would actually

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.250 
to go there and sometimes would actually
take<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.160> symbol<00:05:13.640> when<00:05:14.420> we<00:05:14.570> didn't

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
take the symbol when we didn't

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.720 
take the symbol when we didn't
necessarily<00:05:15.470> notice<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.490> there<00:05:16.670> was

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.360 
necessarily notice that there was
possibly<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.240> scenario<00:05:18.230> happening<00:05:18.740> but<00:05:19.130> there

building and I sort of just looked
through<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.830> question<00:06:04.130> out<00:06:04.280> do<00:06:04.520> we<00:06:04.640> want<00:06:04.820> to

purchase<00:06:05.090> another<00:06:05.510> one<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:05.870> said<00:06:06.860> just<00:06:07.010> our

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
purchase another one I said just our

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.340 
purchase another one I said just our
discussion<00:06:07.550> amongst<00:06:07.820> ourselves<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.420> come

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
discussion amongst ourselves and come

discussion amongst ourselves and come
back<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.740> me<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.760> they<00:06:11.300> felt<00:06:11.570> that<00:06:11.660> our

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
back to me and they felt that our

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020 
back to me and they felt that our
behaviors<00:06:12.410> would<00:06:12.560> regress<00:06:12.920> if<00:06:13.310> we<00:06:13.730> didn't

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
behaviors would regress if we didn't

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.910 
behaviors would regress if we didn't
have<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:14.330> opportunity<00:06:14.630> to<00:06:15.230> be<00:06:15.350> able<00:06:15.440> to<00:06:15.710> use

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
have that opportunity to be able to use

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.810 
have that opportunity to be able to use
the<00:06:16.070> safe<00:06:16.280> space

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
the safe space

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.020 
the safe space
let's<00:06:17.300> not<00:06:17.480> take<00:06:17.660> it<00:06:17.840> away<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.290> as<00:06:18.790> Sam<00:06:19.790> said

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
let's not take it away and as Sam said

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.980 
let's not take it away and as Sam said
earlier<00:06:20.420> perhaps<00:06:20.960> we<00:06:21.230> need<00:06:21.380> to<00:06:22.840> so<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:23.870> think

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
earlier perhaps we need to so I think

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.890 
earlier perhaps we need to so I think
it's<00:06:24.290> been<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.470> huge<00:06:24.530> huge<00:06:25.190> huge<00:06:25.490> bonus<00:06:26.150> to

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
it's been a huge huge huge bonus to

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.040 
it's been a huge huge huge bonus to
Hollygrove<00:06:27.140> to<00:06:27.470> have<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.710> system
