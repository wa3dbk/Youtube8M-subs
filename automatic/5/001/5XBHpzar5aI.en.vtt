how<00:00:43.810> did<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.020> get<00:00:44.170> us<00:00:44.320> into<00:00:44.500> this<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.310> was<00:00:46.240> just

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:58.260 

we're<00:00:51.220> all<00:00:51.250> awake<00:00:51.580> now<00:00:51.760> that's<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.180> show

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
the true wind actually not very hot it's

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.400 
the true wind actually not very hot it's
just<00:01:00.190> filled<00:01:00.520> with<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.760> school<00:01:01.170> said<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.320> a

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
just filled with the school said just a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180 
just filled with the school said just a
whole<00:01:02.860> bunch<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.160> rain<00:01:04.440> we<00:01:05.440> great<00:01:05.650> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.979> gym

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
whole bunch of rain we great in the gym

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.750 
whole bunch of rain we great in the gym
and<00:01:06.729> we<00:01:07.390> pulled<00:01:07.659> in<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.869> mind<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.550> that<00:01:09.580> would

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
and we pulled in the mind so that would

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.219 
and we pulled in the mind so that would
just<00:01:09.909> ease<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.240> through<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.780> little<00:01:11.020> bit<00:01:11.200> of

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
just ease it through this little bit of

just ease it through this little bit of
a<00:01:11.350> school<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.830> then<00:01:11.890> we'll<00:01:12.040> continue<00:01:12.190> on<00:01:12.460> our

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
a school and then we'll continue on our

the<00:01:14.200> radar<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> very<00:01:15.040> useful<00:01:15.250> tool<00:01:15.700> for

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the radar is a very useful tool for

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.330 
the radar is a very useful tool for
storms<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:17.080> can<00:01:17.229> plot<00:01:17.409> their<00:01:17.649> position<00:01:18.159> and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
storms you can plot their position and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.460 
storms you can plot their position and
in<00:01:18.550> many<00:01:18.759> cases<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.240> change<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.869> course<00:01:20.140> will

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
in many cases a change of course will

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.710 
in many cases a change of course will
avoid<00:01:20.770> most<00:01:21.100> or<00:01:21.430> all<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.090> squall<00:01:24.720> some

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
avoid most or all of the squall some

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.060 
avoid most or all of the squall some
squalls<00:01:26.110> have<00:01:26.320> more<00:01:26.530> wind<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.890> them

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
squalls have more wind in them

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.399 
squalls have more wind in them
occasionally<00:01:27.640> up<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.240> 30<00:01:28.479> knots<00:01:28.780> or<00:01:29.110> higher

occasionally up to 30 knots or higher

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.800 
occasionally up to 30 knots or higher
when<00:01:30.159> others<00:01:30.429> might<00:01:30.759> not<00:01:31.000> have<00:01:31.179> any<00:01:31.330> increase

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
when others might not have any increase

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.050 
when others might not have any increase
but<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:32.770> still<00:01:33.009> have<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.280> pay<00:01:33.429> attention<00:01:33.550> if

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
but you still have to pay attention if

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.880 
but you still have to pay attention if
there<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.420> wind<00:01:34.690> shift<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.259> we<00:01:35.710> usually

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
there is a wind shift and we usually

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.980 
there is a wind shift and we usually
take<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.429> precaution<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.149> reefing<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.630> sails

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
take the precaution of reefing the sails

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:46.850 
take the precaution of reefing the sails
in<00:01:38.259> case

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.850 

take<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.550> opportunity

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 

and<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> soap<00:01:53.730> out<00:01:53.940> that's<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.450> guarantee

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and get the soap out that's a guarantee

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.480 
and get the soap out that's a guarantee
to<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.380> stop<00:01:55.590> raining

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.800 

it's<00:01:58.850> related<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.480> tropical
