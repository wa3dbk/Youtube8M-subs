actually got kicked out of that school

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.679

because<00:01:08.979> we<00:01:09.610> eventually<00:01:09.970> ended<00:01:10.420> up<00:01:10.509> moving

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
because we eventually ended up moving

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
school to go to well the city that I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.050 
school to go to well the city that I
actually<00:01:20.020> moved<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.590> was<00:01:20.950> kind<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.579> a<00:01:21.670> bad<00:01:21.880> area

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
actually moved to was kind of a bad area

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.270 
actually moved to was kind of a bad area
and<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.689> public<00:01:22.990> schools<00:01:23.290> had<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.680> really<00:01:24.009> bad

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
and the public schools had a really bad

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.850 
and the public schools had a really bad
rep<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.610> him<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.149> eventually<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.140> wound<00:01:26.649> up

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
rep to him so eventually I wound up

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.660 
rep to him so eventually I wound up
going<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.670> Catholic<00:01:28.329> school<00:01:28.360> now<00:01:29.229> me<00:01:30.130> being

a Christian I was not Catholic and i'm

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.550 
a Christian I was not Catholic and i'm
still<00:01:33.610> not<00:01:33.729> Catholic<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:34.539> I<00:01:34.719> was<00:01:35.140> kind<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.439> an

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
still not Catholic so I was kind of an

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.230

out as being the different person in
quotes<00:01:39.789> just<00:01:40.659> because<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.259> wasn't<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.469 
harsh but it's kind of fucked up how
people<00:01:48.250> can<00:01:48.369> treat<00:01:48.640> others<00:01:49.000> differently<00:01:49.450> just

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
people can treat others differently just

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.389 
people can treat others differently just
for<00:01:49.869> something<00:01:50.469> that<00:01:50.680> they<00:01:50.710> believe<00:01:51.130> so

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
for something that they believe so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.760 
for something that they believe so
anyways<00:01:51.759> that's<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.630> little<00:01:52.869> bit<00:01:52.960> off-topic<00:01:53.320> so

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
anyways that's a little bit off-topic so

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.279 
anyways that's a little bit off-topic so
like<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.460> said<00:01:54.520> fifth<00:01:54.969> grade<00:01:55.180> year<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
like I said fifth grade year in a

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.399 
like I said fifth grade year in a
Catholic<00:01:57.039> school<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.060> didn't<00:01:58.689> really<00:01:58.750> have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
Catholic school so I didn't really have

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.260 
Catholic school so I didn't really have
that<00:01:59.740> many<00:01:59.979> friends<00:02:00.130> at<00:02:00.549> that<00:02:00.759> school<00:02:01.030> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
that many friends at that school and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.940 
that many friends at that school and
that<00:02:01.539> goes<00:02:01.659> without<00:02:01.840> saying<00:02:02.020> because<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.799> was

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
that goes without saying because I was

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.940 
that goes without saying because I was
the<00:02:03.070> only<00:02:03.219> non-catholic<00:02:04.119> there<00:02:04.359> and<00:02:04.950> having

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
the only non-catholic there and having

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.070 
the only non-catholic there and having
to<00:02:06.159> go<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> church<00:02:06.609> you<00:02:07.270> know<00:02:07.299> doing<00:02:07.659> something

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
to go to church you know doing something

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.450 
to go to church you know doing something
that<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.320> don't<00:02:08.500> want<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:08.920> having<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.369> go

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
that you don't want to do having to go

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.820 
that you don't want to do having to go
to<00:02:09.490> Mass<00:02:09.789> having<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.330> practice<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.810> religion<00:02:10.840> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
to Mass having to practice a religion it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.460 
to Mass having to practice a religion it
was<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.940> frustrating<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.080> way<00:02:14.230> because

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
was kind of frustrating in a way because

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
was kind of frustrating in a way because
it's<00:02:14.680> something<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.280> didn't<00:02:15.550> want<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.790> do

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's something that I didn't want to do

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's something that I didn't want to do
and<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.450> still<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:17.260> religious<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.950> a

and I'm still not that religious of a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.460 
and I'm still not that religious of a
person

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
person

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I do believe in God and that's something

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
really play any minutes because like I

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.570 
really play any minutes because like I
said<00:02:49.940> even<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.050> coaches<00:02:51.530> which<00:02:51.920> were<00:02:52.130> priests

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
at the school they kind of singled me

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.470 
at the school they kind of singled me
out<00:02:54.800> because<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.340> was<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.550> only<00:02:55.700> non<00:02:55.940> Catholic

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
out because I was the only non Catholic

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.230 
out because I was the only non Catholic
so<00:02:56.780> what<00:02:57.530> had<00:02:57.650> happened<00:02:58.040> was<00:02:58.220> we<00:02:58.850> were<00:02:58.940> going

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
so what had happened was we were going

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.330 
so what had happened was we were going
into<00:02:59.390> practice<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.050> one<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.920> kids<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.480 
into practice and one of the kids on the
team<00:03:01.660> decided<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.230> get<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.920> couple<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> his

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490

so what happened was he actually got a
pretty<00:03:37.459> good<00:03:37.640> punch<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.360> chin<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.140> I

mouth I knocked two of his teeth out and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680 
mouth I knocked two of his teeth out and
I<00:04:10.040> ended<00:04:10.280> up<00:04:10.430> breaking<00:04:10.970> my<00:04:11.239> middle<00:04:11.510> knuckle

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
I ended up breaking my middle knuckle

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.750 
I ended up breaking my middle knuckle
and<00:04:12.049> that's<00:04:12.470> something<00:04:12.830> that<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.130> still<00:04:13.519> deal

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
and that's something that I still deal

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.460 
and that's something that I still deal
with<00:04:13.790> today<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.630> broken<00:04:15.049> middle<00:04:15.290> knuckle

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
with today is that broken middle knuckle

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.979 
with today is that broken middle knuckle
because<00:04:16.250> i<00:04:16.280> also<00:04:16.580> broke<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.299> baseball<00:04:17.510> too

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
because i also broke it in baseball too

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.840 
because i also broke it in baseball too
but<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.440> one<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.979> different<00:04:19.340> commentary

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
but that one is a different commentary

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.090 
but that one is a different commentary
for<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.060> different<00:04:20.450> day<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.169> like<00:04:21.590> i<00:04:21.709> said<00:04:21.739> i

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
for a different day so like i said i

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.490 
for a different day so like i said i
ended<00:04:22.640> up<00:04:22.760> breaking<00:04:23.240> his<00:04:23.479> orbital<00:04:23.870> bone<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.410> i

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
ended up breaking his orbital bone and i

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.380 
ended up breaking his orbital bone and i
also<00:04:24.680> ended<00:04:25.250> up<00:04:25.430> knocking<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:26.000> two<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.270> his

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
also ended up knocking out two of his

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.439 
also ended up knocking out two of his
teeth<00:04:26.599> so<00:04:27.050> he<00:04:27.349> went<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.710> ran

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
teeth so he went and ran

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.929 
teeth so he went and ran
the<00:04:28.659> coach<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.349> what<00:04:30.069> had<00:04:30.159> happened<00:04:30.520> was<00:04:30.580> I

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
the coach and what had happened was I

the coach and what had happened was I
actually<00:04:31.090> got<00:04:31.419> kicked<00:04:31.749> out<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.080> school

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
actually got kicked out of that school

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.559 
actually got kicked out of that school
as<00:04:32.680> well<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.159> then<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:33.789> moved<00:04:34.059> to<00:04:34.270> where<00:04:34.539> I

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
as well and then we moved to where I

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.290 
as well and then we moved to where I
live<00:04:34.840> now<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:35.080> Indiana<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.949> all<00:04:36.490> this<00:04:37.059> well

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
live now in Indiana and all this well

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
live now in Indiana and all this well
now<00:04:37.539> you<00:04:38.139> know<00:04:38.259> everything<00:04:38.529> happens<00:04:38.919> for<00:04:39.430> a

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
now you know everything happens for a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.279 
now you know everything happens for a
reason<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.879> suppose<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.599> that<00:04:40.749> was<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.020> my

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
reason I suppose and that was just my

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.619 
reason I suppose and that was just my
way<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.770> experiencing<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.669> fight<00:04:42.909> firsthand<00:04:43.300> I

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
way of experiencing a fight firsthand I

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.659 
way of experiencing a fight firsthand I
haven't<00:04:44.139> fought<00:04:44.349> since<00:04:44.710> that<00:04:45.159> was<00:04:45.249> my<00:04:45.400> first

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
haven't fought since that was my first

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.070 
haven't fought since that was my first
and<00:04:45.789> only<00:04:45.909> fight<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.509> it<00:04:46.569> was<00:04:46.659> in<00:04:46.779> fifth<00:04:46.990> grade

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
and only fight and it was in fifth grade

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.959 
and only fight and it was in fifth grade
so<00:04:47.409> I<00:04:47.439> mean<00:04:47.620> it's<00:04:47.740> kind<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.069> funny<00:04:48.219> story<00:04:48.370> if

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
so I mean it's kind of a funny story if

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.089 
so I mean it's kind of a funny story if
you<00:04:49.270> really<00:04:49.479> think<00:04:49.629> about<00:04:49.749> it<00:04:49.930> but<00:04:50.379> other<00:04:50.830> than

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
you really think about it but other than

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.619 
you really think about it but other than
that<00:04:51.159> that's<00:04:51.789> pretty<00:04:52.120> much<00:04:52.240> all<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.599> time

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
that that's pretty much all the time
