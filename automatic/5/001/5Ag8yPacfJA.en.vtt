be the first time that they have done
that<00:02:35.709> most<00:02:36.709> likely<00:02:36.920> they'd<00:02:37.220> have<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.550> be<00:02:37.640> in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that most likely they'd have to be in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.380 
that most likely they'd have to be in
the<00:02:37.790> top<00:02:38.000> three<00:02:38.480> here<00:02:38.720> inin<00:02:39.080> Dungeon<00:02:39.620> lead<00:02:40.390> but

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
the top three here inin Dungeon lead but

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.880 
the top three here inin Dungeon lead but
Meno<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.720> Santa<00:02:42.170> yet<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.650> skate

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.059 

I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.690> number<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.260> really<00:02:52.500> beginning

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
I think this number is really beginning

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:56.740 
I think this number is really beginning
to<00:02:53.310> bring<00:02:53.520> out

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.290 

I<00:03:56.810> think<00:03:57.440> he's<00:03:57.650> an<00:03:57.830> enormous<00:03:58.190> talent<00:03:58.910> and

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
I think he's an enormous talent and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780 
I think he's an enormous talent and
they've<00:03:59.510> grown<00:03:59.660> together<00:03:59.960> so<00:04:00.830> much<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.670> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
they've grown together so much so in the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:12.100 
they've grown together so much so in the
past<00:04:02.000> year<00:04:02.360> it's<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.990> delight<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.380> see

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:34.130 

and<00:04:12.320> experience<00:04:12.890> does<00:04:13.130> pay<00:04:13.460> off

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.350 

by<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.740> way<00:04:34.920> Stephanie's<00:04:35.490> sister<00:04:36.000> and

talented that was exciting
the<00:05:27.550> choreography<00:05:28.330> was<00:05:28.360> interesting<00:05:29.139> it<00:05:29.289> was

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
the choreography was interesting it was

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.260 
the choreography was interesting it was
creative<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:30.220> wasn't<00:05:30.580> just<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.000> same<00:05:31.240> old

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
creative it wasn't just the same old

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.749 
creative it wasn't just the same old
thing<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:31.990> it<00:05:32.470> also<00:05:32.710> on<00:05:33.009> top<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.280> that<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.639> was

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
thing and it also on top of that it was

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.760 
thing and it also on top of that it was
very<00:05:34.090> difficult<00:05:34.389> for<00:05:34.780> them<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.050> create<00:05:35.440> a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
very difficult for them to create a

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.070

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
feeling of unison in a piece of

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.439 
feeling of unison in a piece of
choreography<00:05:38.350> that<00:05:39.220> clearly<00:05:39.550> has<00:05:39.880> two<00:05:40.090> people

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
choreography that clearly has two people
