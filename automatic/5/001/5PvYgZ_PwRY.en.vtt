positive<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.710> baby<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
positive for the baby so I think that it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.790 
positive for the baby so I think that it
really<00:01:00.539> does<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> potential<00:01:01.590> to
