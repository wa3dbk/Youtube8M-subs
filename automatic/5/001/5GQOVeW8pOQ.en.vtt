Cinema<00:00:33.660> Camera<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.860> our<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.280> foray<00:00:35.550> into

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
Cinema Camera it's our first foray into

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
Cinema Camera it's our first foray into
acquisition<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> camera<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:38.250> thought<00:00:38.399> we

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
acquisition with a camera we thought we

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
acquisition with a camera we thought we
had<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> technology<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.960> moving

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
had a lot of technology that was moving

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
had a lot of technology that was moving
in<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.530> direction<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:41.700> thought

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
in this direction and we also thought

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
in this direction and we also thought
that<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.210> could<00:00:42.239> create<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> product<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that we could create a product that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
that we could create a product that
actually<00:00:43.860> empowered<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.610> segment<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
actually empowered a segment of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
actually empowered a segment of
individuals<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.170> weren't<00:00:46.379> currently<00:00:46.800> being

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
individuals that weren't currently being

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.260 
individuals that weren't currently being
serviced<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:47.579> folks<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> wanted<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
serviced as well folks that wanted to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.840 
serviced as well folks that wanted to
have<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:49.200> high<00:00:49.469> quality<00:00:49.500> film<00:00:50.340> like

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
have really high quality film like

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
have really high quality film like
camera<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.930> able<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
camera but be able to have the the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.580 
camera but be able to have the the
workflows<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> they're<00:00:54.149> used<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> seeing<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
workflows that they're used to seeing in

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
workflows that they're used to seeing in
a<00:00:55.739> post<00:00:56.190> production<00:00:56.399> environment<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
a post production environment so this is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
a post production environment so this is
what<00:00:57.780> we've<00:00:57.930> created<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.590> Blackmagic

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
what we've created this Blackmagic

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
what we've created this Blackmagic
Cinema<00:00:59.579> Camera<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.020> an

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
Cinema Camera and what it is is it's an

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.920 
Cinema Camera and what it is is it's an
SSD<00:01:02.129> recorder<00:01:02.640> much<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.120> our<00:01:03.329> hyper<00:01:03.600> Dex

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
SSD recorder much like our hyper Dex

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
SSD recorder much like our hyper Dex
it's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> half<00:01:05.369> K<00:01:05.610> sensor<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> knew

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's a two and a half K sensor we knew

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's a two and a half K sensor we knew
we<00:01:06.420> wanted<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> higher<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.770> HD<00:01:08.159> video

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
we wanted to have a higher than HD video

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
we wanted to have a higher than HD video
resolution<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.020> we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
resolution on there as well so that we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
resolution on there as well so that we
could<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.380> ahead<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.830> great<00:01:11.340> color<00:01:11.610> grades

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
could go ahead and do great color grades

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
could go ahead and do great color grades
or<00:01:12.210> great<00:01:12.390> editing<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.710> will

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
or great editing on that and that will

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
or great editing on that and that will
record<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> raw<00:01:14.610> cinema<00:01:15.090> DNG<00:01:15.509> file<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.049> also

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
record as a raw cinema DNG file so also

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.440 
record as a raw cinema DNG file so also
great<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.740> color<00:01:16.920> grading<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.030> did<00:01:18.420> want

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
great for color grading but we did want

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
great for color grading but we did want
to<00:01:18.689> include<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.470> friendly<00:01:19.920> formats<00:01:20.460> for

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to include some friendly formats for

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
to include some friendly formats for
workflow<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.290> DNxHD<00:01:23.070> empro

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
workflow so we also have DNxHD empro

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
workflow so we also have DNxHD empro
resin<00:01:23.939> coating<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:25.290> also<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
resin coating as well it's also the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
resin coating as well it's also the
world's<00:01:25.920> first<00:01:26.100> Thunderbolt<00:01:26.700> camera<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.299> we

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
world's first Thunderbolt camera so we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
world's first Thunderbolt camera so we
can<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.600> ahead<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.869> capture<00:01:28.290> directly<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
can go ahead and capture directly off of
