00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.519
 Today I will tell you how to grow seedlings 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.490
 pepper and so sowing pepper seeds on seedlings 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.139
 We start in February at the moment of landing in the ground 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 seedlings will be 80 80 days old 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 pepper does not tolerate well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 picking so his him safe right away 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 individual capacity of two or three pieces 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.380
 each then remove the weak leave 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 or you can sow seeds in one pot 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.120
 and swoop after the appearance of two 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 real leaves each 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 individual capacity if picking 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 produce neatly that plant not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.930
 suffer and so for sowing pepper seeds 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.770
 we will need the seeds themselves 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.600
 capacity for seedlings 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 Be sure to do the drainage 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 hole spray with water and 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.439
 soil mixture pepper seeds 3 volts 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 presowing treatment that is before 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:17.640
 all of them need to soak either for a day 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.930
 normal water or for 45 hours in solution 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 growth stimulant and so i have 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 pre-soaked 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.320
 seeds are available so we start planting 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.180
 at first 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.180
 recall our soil capacity 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.890
 continue to fill our tank until 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 the moment when the edge of the tank will 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 about one and a half to two centimeters after 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:04.799
 this abundantly shed now 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.239
 start sowing directly 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.100
 I will sow seeds in a capacity of 2 varieties 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.959
 therefore install separator 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.739
 we take the seeds we start to arrange them by 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.790
 soil surface on a small 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.790
 distance from each other 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.370
 do the same with the second grade 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:21.810
 so the seeds have been sown here 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:24.560
 it turns out now we fall asleep our seeds 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 soil mixture 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:40.250
 about a centimeter layer behind it and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.370
 after the organizer we cover lego 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.260
 plenochkoy or glass I will be here 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.180
 such a cap 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:04.939
 and clean in a warm room when 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.950
 temperature of about 22 23 degrees 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.109
 the lighting in this case will not matter 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.500
 that is, it may even be in the dark 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.880
 but at emergence which usually 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.560
 appear in three or four days 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.039
 will definitely need to put on 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.039
 shine
