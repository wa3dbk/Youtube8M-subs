00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I suppose we have here is a power cable

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.210 
I suppose we have here is a power cable
for<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> charger<00:01:39.000> which<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.070> there's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
for the charger which is here so there's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
for the charger which is here so there's
a<00:01:41.310> wall<00:01:41.490> adapter<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> battery

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
a wall adapter and here is the battery

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.639 
a wall adapter and here is the battery
charger<00:01:43.680> itself<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:46.079> LEDs

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
charger itself so you can see those LEDs

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
charger itself so you can see those LEDs
for<00:01:46.890> charging<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.520> full<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.960> pretty

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
for charging in full so that's pretty

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.179
