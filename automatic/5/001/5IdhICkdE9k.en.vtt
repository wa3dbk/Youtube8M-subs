00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
sweetness of the cherries we need a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
sweetness of the cherries we need a
little<00:01:20.640> citrus<00:01:20.940> so<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.690> gonna<00:01:21.810> add<00:01:22.050> half<00:01:22.980> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
little citrus so we're gonna add half a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
little citrus so we're gonna add half a
lemon<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.480> 1/2<00:01:24.810> ounce<00:01:25.050> of<00:01:25.290> fresh

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
lemon so about a 1/2 ounce of fresh

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
lemon so about a 1/2 ounce of fresh
lemon<00:01:25.530> juice<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.760> then<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:28.550> gonna<00:01:29.550> tweak<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lemon juice and then just gonna tweak it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
lemon juice and then just gonna tweak it
with<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.900> touch<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.410> pink<00:01:31.680> grapefruit

with a little touch of pink grapefruit

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.250 
with a little touch of pink grapefruit
so<00:01:32.940> this<00:01:33.060> probably<00:01:33.420> equates<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> about<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
so this probably equates to about a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.590 
so this probably equates to about a
quarter<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:35.010> an<00:01:35.400> ounce<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.790> freshly<00:01:36.090> squeezed
