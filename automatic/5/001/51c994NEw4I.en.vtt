it go and then bounce it so it's a

it go and then bounce it so it's a
feature<00:00:52.910> volume<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.360> holding<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.500> then<00:00:54.980> you

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
feature volume of holding and then you

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.520 
feature volume of holding and then you
let<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.940> for<00:00:56.149> balance<00:00:56.450> it<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.899> want<00:00:57.469> you

to keep that idea in mind and play with

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.569 
to keep that idea in mind and play with
it<00:01:00.469> a<00:01:00.559> little<00:01:00.649> bit<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:00.950> see<00:01:01.100> how<00:01:01.219> they<00:01:01.370> feel

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
so what you want to remember and this is

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.420 
so what you want to remember and this is
a<00:02:23.020> rule<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> belly<00:02:23.680> unison<00:02:24.100> when<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.280> comes

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
a rule that belly unison when it comes

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.700 
a rule that belly unison when it comes
to<00:02:24.550> arms<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.000> hints<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.840> when<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.230> arm<00:02:26.500> is

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
to arms and hints is when the arm is

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.760 
to arms and hints is when the arm is
going<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.670> hands<00:02:28.060> are<00:02:28.210> always<00:02:28.360> down<00:02:28.770> one

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
going up the hands are always down one

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.250 
going up the hands are always down one
the<00:02:30.250> hand<00:02:30.610> when<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> arms<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:31.660> down

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the hand when the arms are going down

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.940 
the hand when the arms are going down
the<00:02:32.560> hands<00:02:32.980> are<00:02:33.160> up<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.770> my

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the hands are up like that so that my

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.340 
the hands are up like that so that my
arm<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.580> down

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
arm is going down

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.130 
arm is going down
okay<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.310> shoulder<00:02:40.650> elbow<00:02:41.650> arm<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:43.750> arm

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.550 

shoulder<00:02:47.140> elbow<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.600> exaggerating<00:02:49.960> even

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
shoulder elbow so I'm exaggerating even

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.900 
shoulder elbow so I'm exaggerating even
of<00:02:50.650> course<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.280> get<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.670> point

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
of course when you get to the point

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.400 
of course when you get to the point
where<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> practice<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.780> well<00:02:52.930> enough<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
where you practice it well enough that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.530 
where you practice it well enough that
it's<00:02:53.530> easy<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.910> focus

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
it's easy you don't really have to focus

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.590 
it's easy you don't really have to focus
every<00:02:56.050> part<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.240> basic

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
every part but that is the basic

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.720 
every part but that is the basic
technique<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.320> how<00:02:59.440> every<00:02:59.710> part<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.580> your

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
technique and how every part in your

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.150 
technique and how every part in your
body<00:03:00.910> moves<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.350> same<00:03:02.560> thing<00:03:02.590> again<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:02.950> can

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
body moves so same thing again you can

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.620 
body moves so same thing again you can
practice<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.820> other<00:03:03.970> side<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.480> is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
practice it on the other side so is

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.190 
practice it on the other side so is
shoulder<00:03:05.170> forward<00:03:05.550> elbow<00:03:06.550> in<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.360> arm<00:03:07.630> up<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
shoulder forward elbow in the arm up and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.660 
shoulder forward elbow in the arm up and
then<00:03:08.880> bounce<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.150> beach<00:03:10.360> ball<00:03:10.630> shoulder

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.490 

that's<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.850> arm<00:03:19.060> goes<00:03:19.360> down<00:03:19.390> keep<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.230> arm<00:03:20.410> a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
that's the arm goes down keep that arm a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.040 
that's the arm goes down keep that arm a
little<00:03:20.710> bit<00:03:20.800> close<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> bottom<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.540> that's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
little bit close to the bottom so that's

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.410 
little bit close to the bottom so that's
how<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.320> do<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.560> obviously<00:03:24.160> one<00:03:24.610> arm<00:03:24.820> at<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> time

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
how we do it obviously one arm at a time

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090 
how we do it obviously one arm at a time
no<00:03:25.600> what<00:03:25.960> tends<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.350> tricky<00:03:26.650> for<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.890> lot<00:03:26.920> of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
no what tends to be tricky for a lot of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.530 
no what tends to be tricky for a lot of
people<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.790> alternating<00:03:28.860> okay<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:31.270> takes<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
people is alternating okay it takes a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.150 
people is alternating okay it takes a
little<00:03:31.690> bit<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.900> focus<00:03:32.080> then<00:03:32.440> double<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.040> get

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
little bit of focus then double you get

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.360 
little bit of focus then double you get
it<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.690> how<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.840> do<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.410> let's<00:03:36.190> just

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
it but it is how you do it so let's just

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.800 
it but it is how you do it so let's just
say<00:03:36.580> we're<00:03:36.820> going<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.000> start<00:03:37.270> with<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.570> left

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
say we're going to start with the left

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.170 
say we're going to start with the left
shoulder<00:03:38.820> elbow<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:42.190> as<00:03:42.430> soon<00:03:42.940> as<00:03:43.060> I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
shoulder elbow and then as soon as I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.630 
shoulder elbow and then as soon as I
start<00:03:43.450> moving<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:44.140> arm<00:03:44.440> up<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:45.070> bounce<00:03:45.370> that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
start moving this arm up to bounce that

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.720 
start moving this arm up to bounce that
beach<00:03:45.940> ball

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
beach ball

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.280 
beach ball
I'm<00:03:48.730> gonna<00:03:49.240> start<00:03:49.600> on<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> other<00:03:50.020> arm

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
I'm gonna start on the other arm

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.100 
I'm gonna start on the other arm
shoulder<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.240> want<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.540> end<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:52.780> kind<00:03:53.050> of

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
shoulder so you want to end up kind of

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.710 
shoulder so you want to end up kind of
looking<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.470> little<00:03:53.500> bit<00:03:53.740> like<00:03:53.980> this<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
looking a little bit like this and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.840 
looking a little bit like this and
bounce<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.930> beach<00:03:59.170> ball<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.740> the<00:04:00.250> right<00:04:00.550> as

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
bounce the beach ball on the right as

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.610 
bounce the beach ball on the right as
you<00:04:01.030> could<00:04:01.210> have<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.390> beach<00:04:01.660> ball<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
you could have a beach ball with the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.660 
you could have a beach ball with the
left<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:04.740> bounce<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.980> beach<00:04:06.190> ball<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.550> the

right

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.940 
right
and<00:04:08.209> then<00:04:08.390> he<00:04:08.450> gave<00:04:08.569> alternating<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:09.650> pretty

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and then he gave alternating so pretty

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.559 
and then he gave alternating so pretty
much<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.400> beach<00:04:10.730> balls<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.180> each<00:04:11.299> hand

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
much you get to beach balls of each hand

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.630 
much you get to beach balls of each hand
but<00:04:11.780> when<00:04:12.560> do<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.709> bounce<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.159> one<00:04:13.310> beach<00:04:13.489> of

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
but when do you bounce in one beach of

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.979 
but when do you bounce in one beach of
all<00:04:13.730> you're<00:04:13.939> lifting<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.299> other<00:04:14.540> beach<00:04:14.750> ball

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
all you're lifting the other beach ball

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.469 
all you're lifting the other beach ball
I<00:04:15.290> guess<00:04:15.709> that's<00:04:15.950> kind<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.280> interesting<00:04:17.060> what

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
I guess that's kind of interesting what

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.819 
I guess that's kind of interesting what
you<00:04:17.600> think<00:04:17.780> about<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.470> constantly

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
you think about it so you constantly

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.009 
you think about it so you constantly
have<00:04:19.669> those<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.090> reach<00:04:20.269> balls<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.900> get<00:04:20.989> a

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
have those to reach balls and you get a

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.050 
have those to reach balls and you get a
bounce<00:04:21.229> when<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.739> lift<00:04:21.889> one<00:04:22.130> dose<00:04:22.850> this

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
bounce when as you lift one dose this

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.420 
bounce when as you lift one dose this
beach<00:04:23.300> ball<00:04:23.479> as<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.750> lift<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.960> other<00:04:24.139> one

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
beach ball as you lift the other one

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.409 
beach ball as you lift the other one
bounces<00:04:25.430> beach<00:04:25.639> ball<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.150> look<00:04:26.300> at<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
bounces beach ball as you look at the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.909 
bounces beach ball as you look at the
other<00:04:26.570> one<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.080> that's<00:04:27.289> gonna<00:04:27.470> keep<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.830> like

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
other one and that's gonna keep it like

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.409 
other one and that's gonna keep it like
that<00:04:27.949> and<00:04:28.430> they're<00:04:28.520> gonna<00:04:28.580> give<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:28.880> analogy

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
that and they're gonna give that analogy

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.689 
that and they're gonna give that analogy
in<00:04:29.600> mind<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.990> really<00:04:30.110> helps<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.460> got<00:04:31.610> to

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
in mind it really helps but you got to

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:32.680 
in mind it really helps but you got to
remember<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:31.970> as<00:04:32.150> soon<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.449> start

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
remember that as soon as you start

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.810 
remember that as soon as you start
dropping<00:04:33.080> what<00:04:33.259> aren't<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.400> other<00:04:34.580> ones

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
dropping what aren't the other ones

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.950 
dropping what aren't the other ones
stretch<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.210> go<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.860> okay<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.330> don't<00:04:38.330> try<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
stretch to go up okay and don't try to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.480 
stretch to go up okay and don't try to
lift<00:04:39.350> one<00:04:39.590> arm<00:04:39.620> before<00:04:39.949> you<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.160> don't<00:04:40.280> want<00:04:40.460> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
lift one arm before you I don't want to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.560 
lift one arm before you I don't want to
actually<00:04:40.820> go<00:04:40.940> down

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
actually go down

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.700 
actually go down
hey<00:04:41.780> oh<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:43.100> slow<00:04:43.669> kind<00:04:44.539> of<00:04:44.780> motion<00:04:45.620> he

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
hey oh this we slow kind of motion he

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.140 
hey oh this we slow kind of motion he
doesn't<00:04:46.430> have<00:04:47.210> been<00:04:47.479> faster<00:04:48.289> in<00:04:48.650> one<00:04:49.400> side<00:04:49.729> and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
doesn't have been faster in one side and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.250 
doesn't have been faster in one side and
the<00:04:50.270> other<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.840> know<00:04:50.990> it's<00:04:51.260> very<00:04:52.750> slow<00:04:53.750> on

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
the other you know it's very slow on

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.040 
the other you know it's very slow on
both<00:04:55.010> sides<00:04:55.370> but<00:04:55.880> both<00:04:56.090> sides<00:04:56.360> are<00:04:56.600> going<00:04:56.840> to

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
both sides but both sides are going to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.620 
both sides but both sides are going to
the<00:04:57.169> same<00:04:57.410> exact<00:04:58.419> speed<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.789> wind<00:05:01.789> snake<00:05:02.180> arms

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
the same exact speed and wind snake arms

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.360 
the same exact speed and wind snake arms
like<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.260> part<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.650> takes<00:05:03.949> time<00:05:04.130> so

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
like this this part really takes time so

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.010 
like this this part really takes time so
be<00:05:04.520> patient<00:05:04.550> but<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.509> wouldn't<00:05:05.840> wouldn't

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
be patient but that wouldn't wouldn't

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.510 
be patient but that wouldn't wouldn't
see<00:05:06.259> arms<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.710> can<00:05:06.860> either<00:05:07.099> do<00:05:07.280> them<00:05:07.340> like

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
see arms you can either do them like

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.990 
see arms you can either do them like
this<00:05:07.789> like<00:05:08.090> really<00:05:08.330> close<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.289> body<00:05:09.530> and

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
this like really close to the body and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.839 
this like really close to the body and
really<00:05:11.000> kind<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.770> arching<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:12.860> angling<00:05:13.520> the

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
really kind of arching and angling the

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.629 
really kind of arching and angling the
arm<00:05:14.090> very<00:05:14.690> well<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.500> can<00:05:15.620> also<00:05:15.860> do<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.370> but

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
arm very well but you can also do it but

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.339 
arm very well but you can also do it but
it's<00:05:16.789> kind<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.270> little<00:05:17.510> bit<00:05:17.660> more<00:05:17.840> extended

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
it's kind of a little bit more extended

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.260 
it's kind of a little bit more extended
but<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.070> idea<00:05:19.400> is<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.729> same<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.210> only

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
but the idea is the same the only

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.000 
but the idea is the same the only
difference<00:05:20.510> is<00:05:21.080> when<00:05:21.349> you<00:05:21.380> shouldn't<00:05:21.710> extend

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
difference is when you shouldn't extend

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.560 
difference is when you shouldn't extend
the<00:05:22.250> arm<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.550> little<00:05:22.669> bit<00:05:22.820> more<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.240> do<00:05:23.360> sneak

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
the arm a little bit more to do sneak

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.420 
the arm a little bit more to do sneak
arms<00:05:23.840> it's<00:05:24.320> very<00:05:24.560> difficult<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.130> move<00:05:25.280> the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
arms it's very difficult to move the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.890 
arms it's very difficult to move the
shoulder<00:05:25.760> without<00:05:26.060> looking<00:05:26.479> kind<00:05:26.659> of<00:05:26.690> funny

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
shoulder without looking kind of funny

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.200 
shoulder without looking kind of funny
with<00:05:27.169> it<00:05:27.349> so<00:05:28.039> so<00:05:28.490> when<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.699> want<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:28.940> do<00:05:29.030> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
with it so so when you want to do the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.360 
with it so so when you want to do the
arms<00:05:29.510> like<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.139> and<00:05:30.199> still<00:05:30.680> listening<00:05:31.039> arms

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
arms like this and still listening arms

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.800 
arms like this and still listening arms
with<00:05:31.550> them<00:05:31.699> just<00:05:31.909> all<00:05:32.120> over<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.449> shoulders

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
with them just all over the shoulders

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.610 
with them just all over the shoulders
just<00:05:33.500> alternate<00:05:34.099> elbow<00:05:34.580> hand<00:05:35.270> elbow<00:05:35.960> and

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
just alternate elbow hand elbow and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.370 
just alternate elbow hand elbow and
elbow<00:05:36.949> hand<00:05:37.580> like<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:40.659> so<00:05:41.659> in<00:05:41.990> this<00:05:42.110> case

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
elbow hand like that so in this case

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.460 
elbow hand like that so in this case
your<00:05:42.590> beach<00:05:42.830> ball<00:05:43.130> is<00:05:43.370> a<00:05:44.120> lot<00:05:44.539> bigger

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
your beach ball is a lot bigger

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.830 
your beach ball is a lot bigger
it's<00:05:45.800> like<00:05:46.130> gigantic<00:05:46.849> on<00:05:47.180> both<00:05:47.330> sides<00:05:47.630> but<00:05:47.780> you

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
it's like gigantic on both sides but you

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.560 
it's like gigantic on both sides but you
still<00:05:48.080> doing<00:05:48.320> exactly<00:05:48.710> this<00:05:48.889> thing<00:05:49.099> think<00:05:49.970> so

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
still doing exactly this thing think so

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.149 
still doing exactly this thing think so
when<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:50.870> are<00:05:51.139> the<00:05:51.349> closer<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.889> your<00:05:52.039> body

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
when you are the closer to your body

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:58.110 
when you are the closer to your body
then<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.820> shoulder<00:05:53.560> motion<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:55.990> bigger<00:05:56.990> and

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
then the shoulder motion is bigger and

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.310 
then the shoulder motion is bigger and
Anthony<00:05:59.120> G's<00:05:59.360> just<00:05:59.599> make<00:05:59.780> sure<00:05:59.930> you<00:06:00.020> keep<00:06:00.260> your

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
Anthony G's just make sure you keep your

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.029 
Anthony G's just make sure you keep your
hints

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:31.399 
to me seems to be the trickiest thing

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.729 
to me seems to be the trickiest thing
for<00:06:31.549> most<00:06:31.669> people<00:06:31.789> when<00:06:32.149> I<00:06:32.209> teach<00:06:32.559> they<00:06:33.559> can

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:33.739 
for most people when I teach they can

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:35.169 
for most people when I teach they can
get<00:06:33.860> one<00:06:34.009> side<00:06:34.219> but<00:06:34.489> as<00:06:34.579> soon<00:06:34.789> as<00:06:34.819> you<00:06:34.969> start

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.179 
get one side but as soon as you start

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:37.029 
get one side but as soon as you start
doing<00:06:35.299> both<00:06:35.539> sides<00:06:35.779> and<00:06:36.139> alternating<00:06:36.589> it's

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
doing both sides and alternating it's

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.609 
doing both sides and alternating it's
really<00:06:37.669> harder<00:06:38.059> stuff<00:06:38.329> good<00:06:39.139> like<00:06:39.349> learning

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
really harder stuff good like learning

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.979 
really harder stuff good like learning
