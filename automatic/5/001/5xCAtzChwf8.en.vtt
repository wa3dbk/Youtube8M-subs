hello<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.290> welcome<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.800> my<00:00:02.159> glitch<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.600> so

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hello and welcome to my glitch video so

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.849 
hello and welcome to my glitch video so
basically<00:00:04.770> here's<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.400> glitch<00:00:05.720> but<00:00:06.859> actually

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
basically here's the glitch but actually

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.640 
basically here's the glitch but actually
this<00:00:08.099> machine<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.790> made<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.929> raise<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.380> sad

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
this machine was made to raise the sad

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.120 
this machine was made to raise the sad
but<00:00:11.040> then<00:00:11.759> by<00:00:12.210> accident<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.080> figured<00:00:13.559> out<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
but then by accident I figured out that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.220 
but then by accident I figured out that
you<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.269> duplicate<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.350> witness<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
you can duplicate this and witness and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.029 
you can duplicate this and witness and
there<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> yeah<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.320> course<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.859> also

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
there we go so yeah of course it also

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.140 
there we go so yeah of course it also
works<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.730> gravel<00:00:25.250> just<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.060> don't

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
works with gravel just actually I don't

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.030 
works with gravel just actually I don't
need<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> put<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.199> put<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.680> there

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
need to put it there just put it there

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
need to put it there just put it there
quickly<00:00:32.040> press<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.809> lever<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> only<00:00:36.780> use

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
quickly press the lever you can only use

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
quickly press the lever you can only use
the<00:00:37.260> lever<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.890> nothing<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.670> fast<00:00:39.000> as

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the lever because nothing is as fast as

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.020 
the lever because nothing is as fast as
double<00:00:40.020> clicking<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> lever<00:00:40.940> actually<00:00:41.940> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
double clicking the lever actually you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.310 
double clicking the lever actually you
can<00:00:42.210> probably<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.870> some<00:00:43.460> loop<00:00:44.600> of<00:00:45.600> redstone

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
can probably make some loop of redstone

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
can probably make some loop of redstone
but<00:00:47.390> no<00:00:48.390> matter<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> build<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but no matter so now how to build this

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.229 
but no matter so now how to build this
is<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> looks<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.559> without<00:00:53.070> any<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
is what it looks like without any of the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.350 
is what it looks like without any of the
components<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.610> steak<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
components first of all steak what we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.930 
components first of all steak what we
need<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.930> chest<00:00:58.370> you'll<00:00:59.370> need<00:00:59.550> seven

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
need from the chest you'll need seven

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
need from the chest you'll need seven
blocks<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.870> tree<00:01:01.230> pistons<00:01:01.770> one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
blocks of any kind tree pistons one

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.500 
blocks of any kind tree pistons one
sticky<00:01:02.460> piston<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.270> lever<00:01:03.949> 16<00:01:04.949> redstone<00:01:05.640> 3

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
sticky piston one lever 16 redstone 3

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070 
sticky piston one lever 16 redstone 3
redstone<00:01:07.470> repeaters<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:09.299> gravel<00:01:09.840> or

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
redstone repeaters and some gravel or

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.880 
redstone repeaters and some gravel or
sand<00:01:11.960> first<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.470> place<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
sand first of all let's place the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
sand first of all let's place the
Pistons<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.580> mark<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> pool<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:15.780> it's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Pistons I mark the pool where it's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.399 
Pistons I mark the pool where it's
supposed<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.619> placed<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> gold<00:01:19.040> ok

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
supposed to be placed with the gold ok

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.300 
supposed to be placed with the gold ok
and<00:01:24.770> voila<00:01:26.900> now<00:01:27.900> let's<00:01:28.439> put<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.979> box

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and voila now let's put the other box

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270 
and voila now let's put the other box
they're<00:01:29.970> mostly<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.840> guiding<00:01:31.650> Rex<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
they're mostly for guiding Rex a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.760 
they're mostly for guiding Rex a
redstone<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.409> lever<00:01:35.299> ok

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
redstone this one is for the lever ok

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
redstone this one is for the lever ok
put<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> lever<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.970> activates<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
put the lever here so it activates that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.910 
put the lever here so it activates that
one<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> redstone<00:01:41.460> wiring<00:01:42.920> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
one now for the redstone wiring that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
one now for the redstone wiring that
just<00:01:44.250> place<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:49.820> their<00:01:50.820> basic

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just place like this and their basic

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
just place like this and their basic
connections<00:01:53.960> nothing<00:01:54.960> too<00:01:55.140> complex<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.920> do

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
connections nothing too complex and do

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.499 
connections nothing too complex and do
repeaters<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.250> repeaters<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
repeaters so this the repeaters have to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.249 
repeaters so this the repeaters have to
be<00:02:00.659> precise<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.670> first<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.840> don't

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
be precise so first of all if you don't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.119 
be precise so first of all if you don't
know<00:02:04.500> any<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.060> happens

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
know any of them this is what happens

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.029 
know any of them this is what happens
that<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:09.739> activate<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that one and that one activate at the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.309 
that one and that one activate at the
same<00:02:11.250> time<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.180> only<00:02:12.300> know<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
same time if you only know do this one

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.720 
same time if you only know do this one
the<00:02:13.890> basic<00:02:14.689> contraption<00:02:15.689> works<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.519> some

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the basic contraption works but for some

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.910 
the basic contraption works but for some
reason<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.480> duplicating<00:02:19.230> doesn't<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.859> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
reason the duplicating doesn't so you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.770 
reason the duplicating doesn't so you
need<00:02:20.159> to<00:02:20.280> nudge<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.969> one<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.659> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
need to nudge this one one more and this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.979 
need to nudge this one one more and this
one<00:02:22.019> one<00:02:22.230> more<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:22.730> now<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:24.090> some<00:02:24.389> reason<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
one one more and now for some reason it

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.129 
one one more and now for some reason it
works<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.150> yeah<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.269> need<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> secret

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
works so yeah you need a secret

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.830 
works so yeah you need a secret
combination<00:02:28.889> to<00:02:29.389> make<00:02:30.389> it<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:31.010> now<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.840> can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
combination to make it and now you can

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.069 
combination to make it and now you can
make<00:02:34.139> sand<00:02:34.680> without<00:02:34.950> cheating<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
make sand without cheating and going to

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.209 
make sand without cheating and going to
the<00:02:37.230> beach<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.730> same<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.689> gravel<00:02:40.219> isn't

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
the beach the same with the gravel isn't

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:46.909 
the beach the same with the gravel isn't
