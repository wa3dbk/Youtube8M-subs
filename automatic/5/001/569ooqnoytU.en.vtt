top it says happy birthday and I thought

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.940 
top it says happy birthday and I thought
that<00:00:40.710> was<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.980> cute<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.739> read<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.770> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that was so cute and read it from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
that was so cute and read it from
reading<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.340> back<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.329> says<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.680> in

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
reading the back it says that one in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.360 
reading the back it says that one in
0.06<00:00:47.610> ounces<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> other<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.829> 0.05<00:00:49.829> ounces

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
0.06 ounces and the other is 0.05 ounces

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.290 
0.06 ounces and the other is 0.05 ounces
so<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.620> means<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.879> product<00:00:54.239> than

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so that means one has more product than

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
so that means one has more product than
the<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.890> why<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.160> did<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the other I don't know why they did that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
the other I don't know why they did that
but<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
but it's not it's not even much of a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.160 
but it's not it's not even much of a
difference<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.489> colors<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.390> come

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
