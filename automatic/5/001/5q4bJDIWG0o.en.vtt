00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
oh this one comes with key generator and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.600 
oh this one comes with key generator and
the<00:00:05.400> crack<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.150> version<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.319> iso<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.460> i

to our web through some image all right
we<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.359> open<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.779> let's<00:00:19.650> modify<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.029> let's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
we can open it let's modify it so let's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
we can open it let's modify it so let's
go<00:00:21.480> ahead<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:22.010> here<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.279> paid<00:00:24.380> she's<00:00:25.380> cute

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.430 

so<00:01:05.340> just<00:01:05.580> hopefully<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.050> and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
so just hopefully don't see this and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.330 
so just hopefully don't see this and
realize<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.760> schedule<00:01:09.120> free<00:01:10.340> we're

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
realize that your schedule free we're

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.830 
realize that your schedule free we're
just<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.320> go<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> our<00:01:13.530> key<00:01:13.740> generator

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
just going to go to our key generator

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
just going to go to our key generator
which<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.080> noisy<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.880> we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> select

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
which is noisy and we're going to select

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.130 
which is noisy and we're going to select
undergone<00:01:19.980> two<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.060> here's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.290> key<00:01:23.160> as<00:01:24.140> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
undergone two and here's the key as a

review<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.430> tutorial<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.540> not

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
review from the first tutorial I do not

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
review from the first tutorial I do not
like<00:01:28.050> case<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.710> zeros<00:01:29.160> or<00:01:29.520> O's<00:01:29.940> in<00:01:30.240> them

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like case with zeros or O's in them

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
like case with zeros or O's in them
because<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.080> them<00:01:31.200> confused<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:32.250> easily

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because I get them confused very easily

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.260 
because I get them confused very easily
so<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> copy<00:01:34.260> key<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:36.060> exit

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so we're just going to copy key to exit

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.050 
so we're just going to copy key to exit
let's<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> image<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.580> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
let's go back to the image and just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
let's go back to the image and just
paste<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.660> in<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.130> found<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> easiest<00:01:41.580> way

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
paste it in there found the easiest way

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:54.490 
paste it in there found the easiest way
to<00:01:41.759> display<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.330> put<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.920> steep<00:01:43.920> section<00:01:50.240> this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.200 

now<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.740> won't<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.039> able<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> save<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.850> back

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
now we won't be able to save this back

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.590 
now we won't be able to save this back
to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.539> CD<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.859> error<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.789> try<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> stay

inside replace it can't do it to read

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
inside replace it can't do it to read
only<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.069> try<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> save

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to look around in the disks for file we

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.270 
to look around in the disks for file we
need<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> crap<00:02:35.819> here<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.540> speed<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.560> exe

need to crap here it is speed to exe
this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.420> file<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.170> need<00:02:40.430> crack

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
this is the file that we need crack

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.870 
this is the file that we need crack
solace<00:02:42.349> now<00:02:43.349> we<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.400> create<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
solace now we know when we create the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.000 
solace now we know when we create the
second<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.329> oh<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:46.170> need<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.440> replace<00:02:46.769> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
second is oh we need to replace this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.940 
second is oh we need to replace this
with<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> crack<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:49.170> let's<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.560> back<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.769> our

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
with the crack so let's go back to our

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.199 
with the crack so let's go back to our
iso<00:02:50.459> maker<00:02:51.110> go<00:02:52.110> ahead<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.440> rename<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.940> put
