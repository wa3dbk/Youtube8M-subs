the<00:02:09.890> reason<00:02:10.310> why<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.060> decided<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.720> build<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.680> sink

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the reason why I decided to build a sink

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.930 
the reason why I decided to build a sink
because<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.710> mentioned<00:02:15.740> too<00:02:16.280> many<00:02:16.490> people

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
because as I mentioned too many people

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.050 
because as I mentioned too many people
you<00:02:17.930> know<00:02:18.050> people<00:02:18.080> always<00:02:18.590> say<00:02:18.950> yeah<00:02:19.700> what<00:02:19.910> is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you know people always say yeah what is

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.270 
you know people always say yeah what is
the<00:02:20.210> longest<00:02:20.570> snake<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.140> get<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:22.130> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the longest snake that you get and if I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
the longest snake that you get and if I
tell<00:02:22.550> them<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.850> other<00:02:23.000> record<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.660> 10<00:02:23.840> meters

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
tell them on other record is 10 meters

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.710 
tell them on other record is 10 meters
then<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.280> becomes<00:02:25.610> just<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.060> figure<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.540> their

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
then that becomes just a figure in their
