only outline the pink partially for best

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
only outline the pink partially for best
results<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.790> also<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.210> great<00:01:33.420> idea<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.049> use

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
results it's also a great idea to use

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
results it's also a great idea to use
the<00:01:34.259> stippling<00:01:34.530> motion<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.220> doing<00:01:35.520> this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the stippling motion when doing this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
the stippling motion when doing this
because<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> Polish<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.689> come<00:01:36.869> off<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
because the Polish will come off the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.069 
because the Polish will come off the
toothpick<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> nicer<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.900> really<00:01:39.900> like

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
toothpick in a nicer way I really like

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.690 
toothpick in a nicer way I really like
using<00:01:40.290> gray<00:01:40.619> hair<00:01:40.890> rather<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.430> black

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
using gray hair rather than black

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
using gray hair rather than black
because<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> gives<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> overall<00:01:42.780> design<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
because it gives the overall design a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.490 
because it gives the overall design a
softer<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.450> don't<00:01:45.450> forget<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> add<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> few

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
softer look don't forget to add in a few

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
softer look don't forget to add in a few
small<00:01:46.680> grey<00:01:47.100> spots<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.729> tie<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> whole<00:01:48.299> nail
