00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
will say about that situation is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.070 
will say about that situation is
whatever<00:02:23.490> player<00:02:24.030> they've<00:02:24.300> announced<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
whatever player they've announced as the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
whatever player they've announced as the
starter<00:02:25.500> has<00:02:25.680> gotten<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.100> majority<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
starter has gotten the majority of the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
starter has gotten the majority of the
touches<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.000> week<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.560> something

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
touches that week so that is something

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
touches that week so that is something
to<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.100> about<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.450> West

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to think about if you have you know West

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.060 
to think about if you have you know West
or<00:02:30.959> crow<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.470> your<00:02:31.590> bench<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.920> they

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
or crow all on your bench and they

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.530 
or crow all on your bench and they
announce<00:02:32.370> them<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> starter<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.360> week

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
announce them the starter for that week

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.570 
announce them the starter for that week
not<00:02:34.050> gonna<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> bad<00:02:34.650> play<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.430> for

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
not gonna be a bad play for you so for

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.890 
not gonna be a bad play for you so for
that<00:02:35.640> reason<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.060> think<00:02:36.120> Crowell<00:02:36.630> should<00:02:36.810> be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that reason I think Crowell should be

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.410 
that reason I think Crowell should be

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
lose as far as you know why would they

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.729 
lose as far as you know why would they
keep<00:02:54.600> being<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> rock<00:02:55.290> when<00:02:55.470> they<00:02:55.560> could

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739

a<00:02:57.840> guy<00:02:58.110> that's<00:02:58.350> interesting<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.190> don't<00:02:59.250> think

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
a guy that's interesting I don't think

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.190 
a guy that's interesting I don't think
he<00:02:59.640> has<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> huge<00:03:00.060> upside<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.600> he<00:03:00.720> hasn't<00:03:00.900> big

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
he has a huge upside but he hasn't big

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.309 
could put Britt back on the map you know
it<00:04:30.370> he's<00:04:30.999> not<00:04:31.150> an<00:04:31.330> amazing<00:04:31.659> receiver<00:04:31.990> but<00:04:32.199> he's

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
it he's not an amazing receiver but he's

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.899 
it he's not an amazing receiver but he's
in<00:04:32.439> a<00:04:32.529> good<00:04:32.680> situation<00:04:32.860> as<00:04:33.430> far<00:04:33.460> as<00:04:33.789> they're

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
in a good situation as far as they're

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.999 
in a good situation as far as they're
not<00:04:34.060> paying<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.599> many<00:04:34.810> other<00:04:35.439> receiver

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
not paying to many other receiver

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.739 
not paying to many other receiver
weapons<00:04:36.400> healthy<00:04:36.759> out<00:04:36.879> there<00:04:37.120> for<00:04:37.330> them<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:37.719> I

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:37.749 
weapons healthy out there for them so I

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.719 
weapons healthy out there for them so I
do<00:04:37.960> think<00:04:38.319> Sean<00:04:38.560> Hill<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:38.949> Britt<00:04:39.129> could<00:04:39.550> have

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
do think Sean Hill and Britt could have

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.249 
do think Sean Hill and Britt could have
some<00:04:39.879> chemistry<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.599> he<00:04:40.749> could<00:04:40.960> have<00:04:41.080> even

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
some chemistry and he could have even

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.409 
some chemistry and he could have even
had<00:04:41.379> a<00:04:41.409> bigger<00:04:41.710> game<00:04:42.039> if<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.849> Broncos<00:04:43.060> could

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
had a bigger game if the Broncos could

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.540 
had a bigger game if the Broncos could
have<00:04:43.479> kept<00:04:43.719> up<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.110> kept<00:04:44.319> the<00:04:44.439> Rams<00:04:44.650> passing

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
have kept up and kept the Rams passing

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.830 
have kept up and kept the Rams passing
the<00:04:45.639> ball<00:04:45.789> but<00:04:45.939> they<00:04:46.029> didn't<00:04:46.300> pass<00:04:46.449> too<00:04:46.689> much

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
the ball but they didn't pass too much

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.149 
the ball but they didn't pass too much
in<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> second<00:04:47.379> half<00:04:47.469> brick<00:04:47.800> could<00:04:47.919> have<00:04:48.039> had

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
in the second half brick could have had

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.670 
in the second half brick could have had
an<00:04:48.279> absolute<00:04:48.729> monster<00:04:48.999> game<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:49.689> I<00:04:49.870> do<00:04:50.289> think

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
an absolute monster game so I do think

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.050 
an absolute monster game so I do think
Britt's<00:04:50.919> worth<00:04:51.129> of<00:04:51.310> looking<00:04:51.580> deeper<00:04:51.909> leagues

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
Britt's worth of looking deeper leagues

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.649 
Britt's worth of looking deeper leagues
take<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:52.990> look<00:04:53.139> at<00:04:53.259> quarterback<00:04:53.560> Ryan<00:04:54.009> Mallett
