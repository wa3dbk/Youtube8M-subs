thing to keep in mind when using

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
thing to keep in mind when using
activated<00:01:26.700> charcoal<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.290> don't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
activated charcoal is that you don't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 
activated charcoal is that you don't
want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> use<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.479> during<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.720> same<00:01:30.930> time<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
want to use it during the same time that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.280 
want to use it during the same time that
you're<00:01:31.560> using<00:01:32.210> prescription<00:01:33.210> medicine<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you're using prescription medicine and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.850 
you're using prescription medicine and
the<00:01:34.860> reason<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.840> that's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> toxin<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the reason is because that's a toxin and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
the reason is because that's a toxin and
activated<00:01:38.700> charcoal<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> draw<00:01:39.990> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
activated charcoal is going to draw out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.120 
activated charcoal is going to draw out
the<00:01:40.439> toxin<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.970> you're<00:01:42.329> using

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the toxin and so if you're using

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.630 
the toxin and so if you're using
prescription<00:01:44.130> medication<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:46.430> some<00:01:47.430> type<00:01:47.610> of

prescription medication for some type of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.830 
prescription medication for some type of
ailment<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.759> some<00:01:51.090> activated

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
ailment and you use some activated

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
ailment and you use some activated
charcoal<00:01:52.259> you're<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
charcoal you're not going to get the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
charcoal you're not going to get the
supposed<00:01:54.869> benefits<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:56.040> prescription

money time and energy organic spirulina

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300 
money time and energy organic spirulina
the<00:02:09.509> reason<00:02:09.750> why<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.259> organics<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.039> Alena

juice in my previous videos that I

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.620 
juice in my previous videos that I

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
talked about my detox water and that's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.750 
talked about my detox water and that's
because<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.290> alkalizing<00:03:32.190> when<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.640> goes

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
drinking that water at all actually um

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.970 
drinking that water at all actually um
so<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.049> line<00:04:01.290> actually<00:04:02.010> gives<00:04:02.430> flavor<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:04.170> the

water that I'm drinking the reason why I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.759 
water that I'm drinking the reason why I

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.750 
ought to use micro filtered water is

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
why I also opt for ozonated water is

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.990 
why I also opt for ozonated water is
because<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.419> water<00:04:33.660> has<00:04:34.340> essentially<00:04:35.340> oxygen

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
because the water has essentially oxygen

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.409 
because the water has essentially oxygen
added<00:04:36.449> to<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.979> added<00:04:38.370> oxygen<00:04:38.550> also

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
added to it and the added oxygen also

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.900 
added to it and the added oxygen also
adds<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:39.960> health<00:04:40.320> benefits<00:04:40.500> because<00:04:41.310> an

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
adds in health benefits because an

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.150 
adds in health benefits because an

oxygen-rich environment in your body

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.689 
oxygen-rich environment in your body

body because one fluoride has been found

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.219 
body because one fluoride has been found
to<00:05:24.060> increase<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.810> instances<00:05:25.289> of<00:05:25.590> bone<00:05:26.400> cancer

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
to increase in instances of bone cancer

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.670 
to increase in instances of bone cancer
and<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:29.099> also<00:05:29.340> robs<00:05:29.880> your<00:05:30.120> tissues<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
nutrients because when it enters into

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.839 
nutrients because when it enters into
your<00:05:33.539> body<00:05:33.780> your<00:05:34.410> system<00:05:34.830> needs<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.130> go<00:05:35.340> in<00:05:35.610> and

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
your body your system needs to go in and

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.510 
your body your system needs to go in and
try<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.180> neutralize<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:37.620> effects<00:05:37.949> of<00:05:38.130> it<00:05:38.310> and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
try to neutralize the effects of it and

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.260 
try to neutralize the effects of it and
so<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.150> starts<00:05:39.449> pulling<00:05:40.580> calcium<00:05:41.580> from<00:05:42.180> your

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
so it starts pulling calcium from your

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.320 
so it starts pulling calcium from your
bones<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:43.139> neutralize<00:05:43.919> this<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.090> these

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
bones to neutralize this and so these

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.760 
bones to neutralize this and so these
are<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.630> ingredients<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.139> are<00:05:46.289> inside<00:05:46.740> of
