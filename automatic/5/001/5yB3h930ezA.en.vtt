00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
including the Magnum def mas as well as

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.250 
including the Magnum def mas as well as
the<00:00:40.410> change<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.950> 90<00:00:41.370> day<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.050> well

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the change in 90 day and for as well

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
the change in 90 day and for as well
which<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.129> happy<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.690> well

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which I'm really happy about and as well

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.860 
which I'm really happy about and as well
as<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.520> aek-971<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> can't<00:00:48.600> wait<00:00:48.840> for

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
as the aek-971 that I can't wait for

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.950 
as the aek-971 that I can't wait for
because<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.940> main<00:00:51.420> problem<00:00:51.660> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because I think the main problem with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.910 
because I think the main problem with
the<00:00:52.110> AEK<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.129> reload<00:00:53.460> time<00:00:54.079> for<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.410> weapon

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the AEK is this reload time for a weapon

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.630 
the AEK is this reload time for a weapon
that<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:57.000> focused<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.719> close<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
that is more focused for close to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
that is more focused for close to
medium-range<00:00:59.640> fights<00:01:00.000> take<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
medium-range fights take it really has a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
medium-range fights take it really has a
long<00:01:01.710> reload<00:01:02.640> time<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.270> happy<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
long reload time and I'm happy that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
long reload time and I'm happy that
they're<00:01:04.019> reducing<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> course<00:01:05.640> there's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
they're reducing it so of course there's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
they're reducing it so of course there's
a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> different<00:01:06.479> weapons<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> there

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a lot of different weapons that there

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
a lot of different weapons that there
are<00:01:08.220> reload<00:01:08.729> times<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.570> reduced<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
are reload times will be reduced you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
are reload times will be reduced you
guys<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> check<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.850> for

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
guys can go and check that out for

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
guys can go and check that out for
yourself<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.680> one<00:01:13.680> thing<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.520> noticed<00:01:14.760> was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
yourself and one thing I noticed was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.660 
yourself and one thing I noticed was
that<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.420> AS<00:01:15.930> VAL<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> p90

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that the AS VAL as well as the p90

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
that the AS VAL as well as the p90
reload<00:01:18.570> times<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.290> increased<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
reload times will be increased which I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
reload times will be increased which I
don't<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:23.009> happy

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
don't know I'm not really too happy

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
don't know I'm not really too happy
about<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.700> again<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> people<00:01:24.900> use

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
about but again not a lot of people use

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.010 
about but again not a lot of people use
this<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.650> guessing<00:01:26.220> after<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.210> patch

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this so I'm guessing after this patch

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
this so I'm guessing after this patch
even<00:01:28.590> less<00:01:28.829> people<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.490> using<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
even less people are gonna be using the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
even less people are gonna be using the
p90<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> ASL<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:32.220> LMGs<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.270> belt-fed

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
p90 in the ASL so for LMGs the belt-fed

p90 in the ASL so for LMGs the belt-fed
machine<00:01:34.110> guns<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> more

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
be reduced over a range of but they're

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
be reduced over a range of but they're
gonna<00:01:50.970> increase<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.689> close-range<00:01:52.200> damage

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
gonna increase the close-range damage

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.100 
gonna increase the close-range damage
that<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> does<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.630> happy<00:01:54.869> about

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I'm really looking forward to using the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.740 
I'm really looking forward to using the
UMP<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.360> ump45<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
UMP because i think the ump45 is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.090 
UMP because i think the ump45 is
probably<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> my<00:02:01.469> favorite<00:02:01.979> CDW's<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.360> use

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
probably one of my favorite CDW's to use

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.940 
probably one of my favorite CDW's to use
also<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.399> m1911<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.479> minimal

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
also the m1911 is minimal

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.219 
also the m1911 is minimal
damage<00:02:07.280> has<00:02:07.310> been<00:02:07.490> increased<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.899> to

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
damage has been increased and this is to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
damage has been increased and this is to
balance<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:11.030> know<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.480> damage<00:02:11.720> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
balance out the you know the damage that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.430 
balance out the you know the damage that
in<00:02:12.680> 1911<00:02:13.099> does<00:02:13.730> compared<00:02:14.269> to<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.870> Magnum

pistols now for the m93 re Africa it's

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.089 
pistols now for the m93 re Africa it's
damaged<00:02:24.050> as<00:02:24.200> well<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.590> range<00:02:24.830> has<00:02:25.069> been

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
damaged as well as range has been

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.400 
damaged as well as range has been
reduced<00:02:25.519> but<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> also<00:02:26.269> got<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> reduced<00:02:27.170> recoil

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
reduced but it also got a reduced recoil

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.479 
reduced but it also got a reduced recoil
now<00:02:28.160> for<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.730> sg553<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.080> mg36<00:02:30.739> as<00:02:31.190> well<00:02:31.400> as

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
now for the sg553 the mg36 as well as

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.300 
now for the sg553 the mg36 as well as
aim<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.880> 16<00:02:32.330> their<00:02:32.690> Rickles<00:02:33.260> had<00:02:34.040> been

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.100 
aim for 16 their Rickles had been
reduced<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.269> they're<00:02:35.599> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> much

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
reduced so they're going to be a much

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.110 
reduced so they're going to be a much
more<00:02:36.290> effective<00:02:36.849> specifically<00:02:37.849> for<00:02:38.030> the

more effective specifically for the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
reduced for mg36 its vertical recoil has

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.839 
reduced for mg36 its vertical recoil has
been<00:02:44.330> reduced<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> m416<00:02:46.130> the

been reduced and for the m416 the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.780 
been reduced and for the m416 the

vertical rico the horizontal recalled

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.360 
vertical rico the horizontal recalled
and<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.450> first<00:02:50.900> shot<00:02:51.200> recall<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:51.799> have<00:02:52.190> been

and the first shot recall all have been

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.160 
and the first shot recall all have been
reduced<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:53.000> make<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> stand<00:02:53.750> out<00:02:53.840> from<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
reduced to make you stand out from the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.370 
reduced to make you stand out from the
in<00:02:54.440> 15<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.310> i<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.750> they're<00:02:57.079> really

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
in 15 and i think that they're really

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.559 
in 15 and i think that they're really
pushing<00:02:57.620> for<00:02:58.099> other<00:02:58.640> people<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.180> start<00:02:59.420> using

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
pushing for other people to start using

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.830 
pushing for other people to start using
other<00:03:00.079> cons<00:03:00.410> other<00:03:01.010> than<00:03:01.250> n<00:03:01.430> 16<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.540> think

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
other cons other than n 16 and I think

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.170 
other cons other than n 16 and I think
the<00:03:03.049> m416<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:04.250> might<00:03:04.489> be<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.000> those

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the m416 just might be one of those

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.850 
the m416 just might be one of those
weapons<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.230> should<00:03:06.410> definitely<00:03:06.560> try

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
weapons that you should definitely try

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.650 
weapons that you should definitely try
out<00:03:07.099> after<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> patch<00:03:09.010> for<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.430> m16a3<00:03:11.150> its

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
out after the patch for the m16a3 its

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.750 
out after the patch for the m16a3 its
recoil<00:03:12.410> amounts<00:03:12.859> have<00:03:13.100> been<00:03:13.160> slightly

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
recoil amounts have been slightly

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.199 
recoil amounts have been slightly
increased<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.810> for<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> m4a1<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.639> recoil

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
increased and for the m4a1 the recoil

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.370 
increased and for the m4a1 the recoil
amount<00:03:17.750> has<00:03:18.350> been<00:03:18.380> also<00:03:18.889> slightly<00:03:19.370> increased

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
amount has been also slightly increased

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.190 
amount has been also slightly increased
for<00:03:21.380> magnum<00:03:21.889> now<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.180> magnum<00:03:23.569> as<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
for magnum now the magnum as you

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.229 
for magnum now the magnum as you
remember<00:03:24.590> from<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.829> last<00:03:24.950> patch<00:03:25.340> its<00:03:25.819> fire

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
remember from the last patch its fire

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.479 
remember from the last patch its fire
rate<00:03:26.540> got<00:03:26.840> an<00:03:26.989> increase<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.709> well<00:03:27.950> as<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.310> a

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
rate got an increase as well as it's a

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.259 
rate got an increase as well as it's a
damaged<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.200> for<00:03:30.709> dispatch<00:03:31.160> its<00:03:31.549> rate<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.000> fire

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
damaged so for dispatch its rate of fire

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.920 
damaged so for dispatch its rate of fire
has<00:03:32.540> reduced<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.040> acts<00:03:34.459> like<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.900> know

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
has reduced so it acts like a you know

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.670 
has reduced so it acts like a you know
one<00:03:36.350> hit<00:03:36.709> cannon<00:03:37.280> now<00:03:37.760> for<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.299> g36<00:03:39.079> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
recoil announced had been reduced making

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.410 
recoil announced had been reduced making
that<00:03:45.560> more<00:03:45.739> effective<00:03:46.370> gun<00:03:46.639> for<00:03:47.269> the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
that more effective gun for the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.710 
that more effective gun for the
engineering<00:03:47.780> class<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:49.150> Jeter's<00:03:50.150> used<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.599> be

engineering class and Jeter's used to be
my<00:03:50.959> favorite<00:03:51.349> engineer<00:03:52.310> weapon<00:03:52.639> before<00:03:53.209> we

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
my favorite engineer weapon before we

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.370 
my favorite engineer weapon before we
got<00:03:53.840> nerfed<00:03:54.109> but<00:03:54.620> i<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:55.459> agree<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:57.049> needed

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
got nerfed but i do agree that it needed

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.759 
got nerfed but i do agree that it needed
some<00:03:57.859> recoil<00:03:58.819> reduction<00:03:59.359> so<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.200> m5<00:04:00.560> k

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
some recoil reduction so for the m5 k

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.940 
some recoil reduction so for the m5 k
they<00:04:01.220> added<00:04:01.519> like<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> burst<00:04:02.120> fire<00:04:02.470> option<00:04:03.470> for

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
they added like a burst fire option for

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.400 
they added like a burst fire option for
it<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.940> i<00:04:05.419> don't<00:04:05.540> know<00:04:05.780> what<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.139> say<00:04:06.169> about

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
it and i don't know what to say about

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.000 
it and i don't know what to say about
that<00:04:06.560> i<00:04:06.769> mean<00:04:06.889> i<00:04:07.280> never<00:04:07.579> used<00:04:07.970> same<00:04:08.180> 5k

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that i mean i never used same 5k

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.380 
that i mean i never used same 5k
I'm<00:04:09.129> sure<00:04:09.310> there<00:04:09.489> are<00:04:09.519> people<00:04:09.909> who<00:04:10.090> appreciate

I'm sure there are people who appreciate

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.750 
I'm sure there are people who appreciate
this<00:04:10.750> console<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.890> might<00:04:12.129> make<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.489> even

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
this console and it might make it even

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.199 
this console and it might make it even
better<00:04:13.030> now<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.959> another<00:04:14.470> notable<00:04:15.310> thing<00:04:15.760> that

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
better now so another notable thing that

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.240 
better now so another notable thing that
I<00:04:16.239> read<00:04:16.600> was<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.930> they're<00:04:17.829> going<00:04:18.010> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
I read was that they're going to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.699 
I read was that they're going to
slightly<00:04:18.639> reduce<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.510> range<00:04:19.750> bonus<00:04:20.199> added<00:04:20.380> by

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
slightly reduce the range bonus added by

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.640 
slightly reduce the range bonus added by
the<00:04:20.739> heavy<00:04:21.040> barrel<00:04:21.250> on<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:22.169> assault<00:04:23.169> rifles

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
the heavy barrel on the assault rifles

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.430 
the heavy barrel on the assault rifles
and<00:04:24.300> instead<00:04:25.300> they're<00:04:25.479> going<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.900> reduce<00:04:26.260> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and instead they're going to reduce the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.430 
and instead they're going to reduce the
range<00:04:26.650> penalty<00:04:27.190> for<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.610> suppressor<00:04:28.150> on

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
range penalty for the suppressor on

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.920 
range penalty for the suppressor on
assault<00:04:29.440> rifles<00:04:29.800> carbines<00:04:30.340> as<00:04:30.760> well<00:04:31.150> as<00:04:31.300> LNG's

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
assault rifles carbines as well as LNG's

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.560 
assault rifles carbines as well as LNG's
and<00:04:32.229> they're<00:04:33.220> also<00:04:33.460> going<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:34.000> slightly

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and they're also going to slightly

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
and they're also going to slightly
reduce<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.289> range<00:04:35.500> penalty<00:04:36.039> for<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
reduce the range penalty for the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.610 
reduce the range penalty for the
suppressor<00:04:36.850> on<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.210> scar-h<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:38.500> they're

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
suppressor on the scar-h I think they're

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.219 
suppressor on the scar-h I think they're
really<00:04:38.949> pushing<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.699> making<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.419> suppressor

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
really pushing and making the suppressor

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.129 
really pushing and making the suppressor
much<00:04:41.770> more<00:04:42.010> factor<00:04:42.430> now<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.840> really

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
much more factor now and it's really

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.100 
much more factor now and it's really
nice<00:04:44.289> to<00:04:44.350> see<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.889> because<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:46.449> be<00:04:46.570> honest<00:04:46.930> no

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
nice to see that because to be honest no

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.529 
nice to see that because to be honest no
one<00:04:47.320> runs<00:04:47.620> suppressors<00:04:48.250> now<00:04:48.520> because<00:04:49.300> the

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
one runs suppressors now because the

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.150 
one runs suppressors now because the
suppressors<00:04:50.139> got<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.740> huge<00:04:52.320> nerf<00:04:53.320> from<00:04:53.949> the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
suppressors got a huge nerf from the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.890 
suppressors got a huge nerf from the
previous<00:04:54.610> batch<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:55.030> I'm<00:04:55.120> glad<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.720> they're

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
previous batch and I'm glad that they're

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.580 
previous batch and I'm glad that they're
bringing<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.830> suppressors<00:04:57.310> back<00:04:57.550> now<00:04:58.590> also

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
bringing the suppressors back now also

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.060 
bringing the suppressors back now also

maximum damage has been slightly

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.080 
maximum damage has been slightly
increased<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:12.340> might<00:05:12.580> actually<00:05:12.760> make

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
increased and this might actually make

little<00:05:33.070> bit<00:05:33.280> buff<00:05:33.520> if<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.389> guys<00:05:34.570> remember<00:05:34.720> the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
little bit buff if you guys remember the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.510 
little bit buff if you guys remember the
Augie<00:05:35.710> 3<00:05:36.220> with<00:05:36.780> influence<00:05:37.780> smoke<00:05:37.990> launcher<00:05:38.520> it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
Augie 3 with influence smoke launcher it

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.560 
Augie 3 with influence smoke launcher it
had<00:05:40.000> no<00:05:40.500> projectile<00:05:41.500> velocity<00:05:42.160> at<00:05:42.460> all<00:05:42.729> so

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
had no projectile velocity at all so

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.770 
had no projectile velocity at all so
they're<00:05:43.870> going<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.820> fix<00:05:45.820> that<00:05:45.940> they<00:05:46.240> said<00:05:46.539> and

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
they're going to fix that they said and

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.920 
they're going to fix that they said and
also<00:05:47.590> for<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> scar<00:05:48.099> l<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.699> heavy<00:05:49.150> barrel<00:05:49.389> not

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
also for the scar l the heavy barrel not

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.659 
also for the scar l the heavy barrel not
increasing<00:05:50.349> recall<00:05:50.889> when<00:05:51.130> zoomed<00:05:51.400> and

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
increasing recall when zoomed and

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.180 
increasing recall when zoomed and
standing<00:05:52.389> there<00:05:52.960> going<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.409> fix<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.770> as<00:05:53.949> well

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
standing there going to fix that as well

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.120 
standing there going to fix that as well
and<00:05:55.320> seems<00:05:56.320> like<00:05:56.440> they're<00:05:56.590> really<00:05:56.949> looking

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
and seems like they're really looking

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.370 
and seems like they're really looking
forward<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:57.729> changing<00:05:58.389> a<00:05:58.810> lot<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.169> things

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
forward to changing a lot of the things

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.460 
forward to changing a lot of the things
for<00:05:59.620> vehicles<00:06:00.190> as<00:06:00.370> well<00:06:00.780> for<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.840> helicopters
