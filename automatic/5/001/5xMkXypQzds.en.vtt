00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.940
 I am a concierge 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.850
 Yes 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.370
 diet 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.190
 Recently I thought that I would like to talk about dieting technique and so on 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.980
 You are not completely talking about psychology techniques 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.230
 I will talk about the time I was dieting, thinking I was getting bored soon 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.230
 Yeah and I I'd had about the original 90 km 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.160
 It is about 68 kg now 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.200
 so 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.829
 To diet 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.860
 Point is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.710
 There one 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.590
 If you do this, you can never go on a diet but you will not eat 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 Only this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
 Say of it do not do Seriously what do seriously selfish 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.880
 Really I just 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.910
 I dropped it from 90 kg to 68 kg 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:05.530
 I work still wrote that which way or say when the 8 Well blog in the Internet 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.530
 Or messing with web pages and uploading videos on youtube 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 After all it 's a net remake work, so I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it. 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 I have not taken that sun completely 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 To waste the time Toka to go to the Toka gym in it to why marathon Even in such a state I 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.860
 Because I want to do that fast, I'm doing it with yellow sand 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.540
 I do not want to leave my computer 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.520
 Status day 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:39.360
 If you want to come to the garden, you have only the option of not eating rice 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 That's why I didn't eat the rice, and I tried to make it go 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 In the end there are no 68 records 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.460
 so 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 mars 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.299
 Hey That's right 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.750
 The point is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 Or rather point 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.800
 Is not it would reservoir quite Hey also is to say do not eat after the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:08.220
 So I need a transformation of values, I say that paradigm shift 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:11.700
 Transforming the sense of value It is necessary to cause a paradigm shift to transform the sense of value 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.300
 I say that other good thing is data reframe 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 Change the framework of thinking 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.770
 I 'm surprised 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.220
 Is that recombinant Rutte 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.510
 You just don't like not eating rice or you want to eat it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 I'm tired and it's summer and I want to eat sweaty and sticky rice. 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 I want to eat steak, I want to eat shabu-shabu, and I don't want to eat even a parfait 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.670
 Or 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:42.709
 I can not do it because I try to do it for a pure diet 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 I can not do that thoroughly, and I often eat it and I wonder if it is okay 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.360
 I think that it is only today and eats a messed-up rice 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.390
 Because it means 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.319
 To save money by changing the way of thinking and say whether should I do to first, do not eat rice 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.670
 Please consider 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.380
 It is very close 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.700
 And if you are in the current traffic jam, maybe it's usually two meals a day, so it's nearly 2000 yen 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.100
 There is a possibility you are using 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.080
 Please cut this into a reproduction 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.080
 Then if I cut 1000 yen every day 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.670
 Yen 3. Man 10,000 one in 30 days 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.460
 It's because I'm going inside 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.680
 It is 30,000 yen because it is 1000 yen where 30 rolls out that house is near 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:33.080
 Are n't you going to save 30,000 yen 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.370
 Because it accumulates 1000 yen a day, I think it would be 30,000 yen in 30 days. 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.350
 Accumulate 10,000 yen in 10 days 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.430
 There is no doubt that the car for 30,000 for 30 days Yes 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.269
 I'm 30,000 floating in a month today 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.720
 Then I think that the unhealthy manual I'm hitting for example at least absolutely 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.780
 You can buy it 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.920
 Is not it become about 60,000 yen After hard months it 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.650
 If you work hard for 3 months, it will go about 100,000 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.489
 If you do so, you can apply for the cheapest course 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.090
 I do not eat rice to think and diet 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.850
 It is no good because I think 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.520
 I do not eat rice to save money 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.049
 Sounds to cut down on food expenses because there is no place to reduce it anymore 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.289
 To say and 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.129
 Please be aware that if you can do so , you will actually be able to save money and have a diet . 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.970
 The 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.389
 I just fail to go on a diet to get a diet 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.190
 is 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:37.700
 And shalt accumulate even gold shalt diet can also 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:43.010
 Because I think that I can do my best quite emotionally if there is an abnormality in the ruins like this 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.400
 Please try it and I don't really know if this is a bit of an animation 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.400
 but 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:55.070
 I wonder if that 's not true 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:58.430
 I really do not avoid It is not really good, so please do not do it if possible 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:02.849
 Is not it always has been recommended that I've done that kind of thing is certainly there about once 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.059
 It was a really difficult situation though 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:10.349
 You 're going to buy a budget bitches at a convenience store in Nori 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:14.309
 Sandwiches or something like that cheesecake or strawberry tart 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:18.779
 Is not it would come back on the Is that not a end up buying at the Toka three wins 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:22.330
 I think I will get fat if I eat this after I get home 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.060
 If it is as it is 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.440
 I will eat it absolutely 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.420
 So at that time 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.420
 Well please do this not really done 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:42.290
 As it is the better I've thrown away 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.290
 I throw away opened in the trash is not it do it not bad being dirty and also 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.450
 If you do it 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.900
 I 'm still a fool if I ever eat 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:56.889
 I can not eat 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:58.660
 This is really a time of satiety, I guess that is a country where some regular staff are having trouble somehow 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:05.020
 It was on 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:06.680
 It is really the selfish arrangement of human beings in developed countries to do such things in such a world 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.430
 but 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:16.160
 But this is a bit of a trick I 've actually been to 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:22.700
 I think I'm already hungry with Nakasugi's stuff, because at first the stomach is big 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:26.050
 Stomach bag If you do not eat rice in a large state, you must eat that stomach bag 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:30.790
 I'm asking for food, because it's open 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:35.650
 That's why I would like to eat this amazing rice, or I filled my stomach. 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:37.210
 Because there is that you are hit in stretches bag than normal to other people it is huge it back but 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.280
 It is not into 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:43.330
 When I try to diet in this state, I have no shot in the stomach . 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:49.330
 I want to eat great 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:50.660
 I do not want to eat this, and I want to fill the stomach outline but this is because I have too much autumn 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.650
 Than that I think 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.600
 Is useless better When I bought the if's in that state because it is absolute that we eat is if available 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.200
 I only throw away If you wait too long and won 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.010
 Or I can go to return, but I do not know whether it will accept returns 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.570
 but 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:10.570
 Or give it to your neighbor 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:11.680
 It is also bad neighbor and her relationship Toka not go even the neighbor's if the other to a convenience store is also in super far away 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.010
 I do not want to 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.790
 If it's in front of you, you 'll be watching this TV and if it's the state you're piling it up 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:21.120
 Please give me 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.120
 It is that I there is also such means or say please 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.710
 A little longer talk of this diet is Yaba rock 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.710
 Let's cut it once This is also
