00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello how are you from lewis and today I 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 I come to teach an egg farm 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.070
 but not a farm I do not know complicated like 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.209
 the one that has the most people a 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.619
 very complicated farm that I do not know that I 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.770
 I see them and I say that I can do it myself 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.260
 then I was looking and I remembered 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:29.800
 that at the beginning of the game for sale 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.080
 when it aired 1.4 it can be 1.5 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.950
 towards me this farm that was very very 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.420
 simple and I do not know how you see how it works 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.920
 way there is a cube on each corner 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.970
 and there's just a little bit in between 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.440
 who brings you the eggs here 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.440
 the truth is that this will welcome them now 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 a stack and a half out there because this already 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 I had it and I'm going to teach you how to do it 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.479
 for those who are good, but still not 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.519
 we have seen how it is done because it 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.850
 have to teach let's start 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.479
 do or say that it is a lac machine 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.399
 huge because you have to download it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.610
 now when you're dating more or less 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.900
 over here it's worth to download all the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.730
 chickens 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 or is preparing to download the 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.920
 chickens and already once everything is 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 right here well better this this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.830
 farm is very good if you are in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.690
 same chung all the time that is whether 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.180
 here ye may be more or less until 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.070
 get to this point because it does not cause 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 and it is very good and the people who are 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 We going in and out so well let's 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 do 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.260
 a block text quoted should 5 x 5 x 5 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.470
 well you can extend everything 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.640
 you want 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.390
 I have passed 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.390
 to the games 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 let's start here it would have to be 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.250
 three for two for one side and has passed 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.570
 and here 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.619
 let's do it somewhere else here at 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.619
 side 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.790
 two 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.450
 now we have to expand it 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.300
 with the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.030
 and now we can 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.030
 choose between doing two things that a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 I would do it 1 d 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.990
 deeper one or enlarge it one myself 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.340
 I think doing the new deep for 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.860
 that the chickens do not jump because it's going to be 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.860
 much better so let's do it 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.800
 to cover the pieces that are jumping 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.100
 because the truth is that the shovel is very 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.100
 broken 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.989
 it's worth doing now do not put 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.370
 stairs put signs things posters 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.080
 because the stairs are going to block in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.629
 sometimes the eggs and they will stay 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.390
 there floating there will be very few who 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.900
 they're going to stay there but they're going to be 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.040
 let's do it because we're 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.040
 I do not have this 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.190
 small and all this 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.450
 have it like that let's make a little step 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.180
 and now what should be done 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 is going to be with this with this with this and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.890
 put this one in each corner so 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.750
 what do you have where you have the object go 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.040
 down I'm the same here and it does not matter if 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.770
 I throw it there all life goes to 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.420
 be concentrated in the center so 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.430
 more or less will give us the same as you see 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.560
 I had 50 here it's okay now for 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.260
 let the good one go around here that is not 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.060
 it would bother you because simply 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.580
 the egg come down here but it's not going to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.160
 move then what we will have to 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.130
 to do would be to put a sign here 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.660
 poster because it does not concern you not what 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.400
 detects as shock block and so 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.400
 you can lower the eggs as much as you 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.160
 nothing 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.520
 and we would put another here is something so 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:39.750
 it's going to flow the mind we have to do 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.410
 some stairs 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 up to this point 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.280
 there are people who make a wall around here 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.980
 any type of block that you have 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.810
 more by hand 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.620
 makes a wall so that to throw them 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.300
 the eggs 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.889
 Well, they can throw them around here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.889
 because maybe I do not know it's uncomfortable 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.780
 as you see now 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.640
 they are small so we should go 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.490
 leaving the needy more or less 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.380
 retired 2 stacks to make four 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.380
 chickens but it's totally random 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.670
 the thing is that in 5 minutes of the video in 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.670
 the other 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.780
 we already have another one with two ones 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.780
 how many 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.900
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.009
 it's a very simple farm I did not want 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.139
 teach because I already knew this but 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.419
 it's a very very simple way that was used 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.860
 before and now I do not see people who 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.719
 just do I'm going to make a 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.059
 complex which will then such pulse button 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.309
 and chickens that are alone is 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.839
 they toast I do not know this you can throw the 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.909
 chickens that you do not do the ones that you go 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.319
 what are you going to use to another site or 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.839
 simply between server there is a 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.939
 store that buy eggs then with this 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.349
 it has the stock farm 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.110
 then you can obviously put a 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.689
 hopper that leads to a chain that carries 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.669
 to a dispenser that pulls the chickens to 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.430
 a site and grow and when a 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.410
 time they burn 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.940
 and it's going to be much more complicated but 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.160
 you are going to have what you want, I hope 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.050
 you liked it as a factory from which 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.400
 It is very well to like and subscribe 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.150
 And until next time 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.150
 goodbye
