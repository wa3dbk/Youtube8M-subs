so<00:02:44.220> as<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.489> lower<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> rotate<00:02:45.420> through<00:02:45.720> your

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
so as you lower and rotate through your

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.540 
so as you lower and rotate through your
left<00:02:46.019> leg<00:02:46.230> through<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.620> range<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:47.010> motion<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
left leg through your range of motion I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.000 
left leg through your range of motion I
want<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.330> picture<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> you're<00:02:49.080> turning

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
want you to picture that you're turning

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.759 
want you to picture that you're turning
the<00:02:50.130> lady<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.910> inside<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.810> turn<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.620> I'm

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the lady to the inside of turn so I'm

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.340 
the lady to the inside of turn so I'm
going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.310> backing<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> camera<00:02:54.780> for

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
going to do this backing the camera for

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.690 
going to do this backing the camera for
the<00:02:55.440> lady<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.100> see<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.519> when<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the lady so you can see this so when I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
the lady so you can see this so when I
rotate<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.420> lady<00:02:57.600> now<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.260> your

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
rotate the lady now this is not your

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.840 
rotate the lady now this is not your
correct<00:02:58.799> alignment<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.489> just<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.819> that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
correct alignment this is just so that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.460 
correct alignment this is just so that
you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.390> where<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:00.750> placing<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.290> lady

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you can see where I'm placing the lady

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
you can see where I'm placing the lady
I'm<00:03:01.769> placing<00:03:02.459> her<00:03:02.910> slightly<00:03:03.390> off<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.660> track

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I'm placing her slightly off the track

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.740 
I'm placing her slightly off the track
I'm<00:03:04.560> connecting<00:03:05.489> my<00:03:05.640> right<00:03:05.910> shoulder<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.540> hip

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I'm connecting my right shoulder and hip

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.229 
I'm connecting my right shoulder and hip
down<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:08.100> come<00:03:08.340> swing<00:03:08.610> my<00:03:08.760> left<00:03:09.000> leg

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
down so I then come swing my left leg

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.650 
down so I then come swing my left leg
out<00:03:09.480> ahead<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.959> me<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.530> side<00:03:10.920> close<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
out ahead of me for my side close and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.050 
out ahead of me for my side close and
this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.930> very<00:03:13.170> important<00:03:13.769> because<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.640> use

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this is very important because as I use

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.150 
this is very important because as I use
my<00:03:15.090> range<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.780> motion<00:03:16.200> through<00:03:16.410> my<00:03:16.620> left<00:03:16.859> leg

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
my range of motion through my left leg

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.190 
my range of motion through my left leg
it's<00:03:17.400> not<00:03:17.640> only<00:03:17.910> signaling<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.989> we're

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it's not only signaling that we're

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's not only signaling that we're
turning<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.980> right<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.180> placing

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
turning to the right but it's placing

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.470 
turning to the right but it's placing
the<00:03:22.049> lady<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.620> correct<00:03:23.070> location<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.450> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
the lady in the correct location so I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.440 
the lady in the correct location so I
have<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> clear<00:03:25.260> path<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.590> move<00:03:26.190> past<00:03:26.519> her<00:03:26.850> for

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
have a clear path to move past her for

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.160 
have a clear path to move past her for
my<00:03:27.630> side<00:03:27.930> together<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:28.590> as<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.850> step<00:03:30.660> onto<00:03:30.900> my

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
my side together now as I step onto my

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.229 
my side together now as I step onto my
right<00:03:31.410> foot<00:03:31.739> I'm<00:03:31.920> allowing<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.670> left<00:03:32.910> leg<00:03:33.209> to

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
right foot I'm allowing the left leg to

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.080 
right foot I'm allowing the left leg to
swing<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.930> ahead<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.590> body<00:03:35.000> changing<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
swing out ahead of my body changing the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.849 
swing out ahead of my body changing the
angle<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.570> my<00:03:36.600> body<00:03:36.989> through<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> strong

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
angle of my body through a strong

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.030 
angle of my body through a strong
diagonal<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.299> close<00:03:39.750> my<00:03:40.049> feet<00:03:40.320> that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
diagonal and then I close my feet that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.069 
diagonal and then I close my feet that
will<00:03:41.250> counterbalance<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.359> force<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.959> that

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
will counterbalance the force of that

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.400 
will counterbalance the force of that
turn<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:44.400> from<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.000> position<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:46.140> lower

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
turn now from that position as we lower

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.229 
turn now from that position as we lower
through<00:03:46.829> your<00:03:47.070> right<00:03:47.250> leg<00:03:47.519> you're<00:03:47.820> using<00:03:48.030> a

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
through your right leg you're using a

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.599 
through your right leg you're using a
range<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.690> motion<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.350> we<00:03:49.829> are<00:03:49.950> now<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.489> to

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
range of motion and we are now going to

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.080 
range of motion and we are now going to
dissolve<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.690> sway<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.250> means<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.940> as

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
dissolve that sway so that means that as

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.330 
dissolve that sway so that means that as
I<00:03:54.209> lower<00:03:54.510> I'm<00:03:54.870> going<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.440> take<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.920> sweat

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
I lower I'm going to take that sweat

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.620 
I lower I'm going to take that sweat
that<00:03:56.819> sway<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.769> become<00:03:58.769> in<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.130> level<00:03:59.459> position

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that sway and become in a level position

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.990 
that sway and become in a level position
now<00:04:00.630> from<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.440> step<00:04:01.769> back<00:04:02.010> I'm<00:04:02.370> then

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
now from here as I step back I'm then

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.809 
now from here as I step back I'm then
going<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.359> dance<00:04:03.600> my<00:04:03.840> heel<00:04:04.290> pull<00:04:05.010> action<00:04:05.670> so

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
going to dance my heel pull action so

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.390 
going to dance my heel pull action so
it's<00:04:05.910> very<00:04:06.060> important<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.889> use<00:04:07.920> your

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
it's very important that as you use your

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.059 
it's very important that as you use your
range<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.760> motion<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.139> dissolve<00:04:10.739> the

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
range of motion that you dissolve the

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.280 
range of motion that you dissolve the
sway<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> very<00:04:11.760> important<00:04:12.299> technique<00:04:12.690> there<00:04:12.989> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
sway a very important technique there so

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.840 
sway a very important technique there so
I'll<00:04:13.440> demonstrate<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.190> Heather<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.730> as

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
I'll demonstrate that with Heather so as

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.080 
I'll demonstrate that with Heather so as
we<00:04:15.030> lower<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.630> rotate<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.739> level<00:04:17.190> off<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.700> go<00:04:18.030> to

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
we lower I rotate I level off I go to

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.570 
we lower I rotate I level off I go to
the<00:04:18.299> inside<00:04:18.659> of<00:04:18.840> turn<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.349> take<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> small<00:04:20.310> step

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
the inside of turn I take a small step

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.190 
the inside of turn I take a small step
to<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.880> side<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:22.049> draw<00:04:22.349> my<00:04:22.560> left<00:04:22.770> foot<00:04:23.010> in

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
to the side and I draw my left foot in

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.310 
to the side and I draw my left foot in
without<00:04:23.380> weight<00:04:23.680> now<00:04:24.600> what's<00:04:25.600> important<00:04:26.110> here

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
without weight now what's important here

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.920 
without weight now what's important here
is<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.070> take<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> small<00:04:27.970> sidestep<00:04:28.690> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
