 so in general when I have a day of 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.209
 rest I clean my brushes I make a 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 little bit of storage is really the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.680
 single day actually in quotation marks where I 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.090

 psychologically at one or two o'clock 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.070
 brush cleaning I think that 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.350
 you see what I'm talking about for the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.300

 goes to make-up of course so 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.180
 today I decided to do something 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.520
 something neutral enough on my face 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.139
 I will not detail everything 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.960

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.900

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.870
 golden foundation that I test in this 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.130
