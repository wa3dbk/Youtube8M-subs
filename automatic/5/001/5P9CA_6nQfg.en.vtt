 what I did interesting bacardi m and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.729
 let's start the very first shooting of which all 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 well know here I added the first 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.230
 string 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.510
 on the third 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.550
 by the way as for the right hand if you 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.740
 noticed i used such a variable 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.200
 hatch 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 middle and thumb middle beat 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 down big up make such here 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 half a circle like this 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 letter e 100 and middle finger down big 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.990
 weight trained by hand to automatism 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.040
 so that it is monotonously rich rhythmic 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.740
 dress 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 down up you get a good one 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.320
 variable stroke 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.510
 especially well when emphasized 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:09.369
 kick up syncope we need tars song 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:14.560
 or rhythm than more passively so more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.450
 rhythmically well so the first two sounds i 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.710
 said the same at the end I added in 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.380
 chord him the second string on the third and 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.340
 on the first leg I used next 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.290
 chord form t but in this chord is necessary 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.080
 how to muffle drunk I'll be what 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.860
 did on kitaro now narrow bodice yes i 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.070
 I do it with my right thumb 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.240
 this chord date format with here's the type 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.310
 derend chord 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.900
 the first string on the third 2 on the fifth and 3 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.270
 by 4 plus 4 pressing 1 5 and fifth string 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.840
 drowning Well 6 was the same as a 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.840
 muffled 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.239
 and I do this with a slide suspension 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.530
 then I used this 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.879
 standard chord explicit at 7 bar and 2 at 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.310
 8 4 3 on the ninth well, I shot the little finger 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.930
 When visit withdraw and it turns out chord 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:28.019
 Theorem 7 can safely lift the second 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:31.280
 finger I get them and not really well 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.769
 added when i added my pinky on 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 tenth to that first string 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:45.840
 it was a chord e7 the same thing all 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.480
 but on 10 2 4 and I used the same one 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.519
 These are the three sounds I took them to the bar with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.340
 using a pair 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:04:06.599
 ring finger 3 1 countries at 12 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:11.660
 and here are all these forms 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.660
 depends on your creative imagination
