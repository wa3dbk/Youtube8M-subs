00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and it is clear I am the first 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.980
 responsible however the players' heads 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.599
 it was a made me a bad rendition 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.839
 I didn't have it too, I had never suffered 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:20.160
 a similar defeat therefore ugly 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.680
 bad bad thing now though if we have to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 raise your head 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 I still see the hope, however, in the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 head of the players must enter the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.730
 really want to believe it because one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.690
 so the performance after that the match 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.579
 with the Padua it was unimaginable 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 unimaginable and therefore hopes there 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.230
 they still seem to be waiting for us and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 so if we want to believe it we must 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.379
 believe it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.520
 the application her hunting man 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.079
 many years he has an explanation 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.469
 logic with a performance of this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.030
 guy 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.860
 given that I will say a very great one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 of no it is true that we say 2 to 0 3 to 0 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 so fast so fast with the hike 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 the game was already over 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 but I did not expect to be killed 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.299
 the approach was just like col 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 padua indeed I had asked for battle 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 even harder in the contrasts la 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.600
 instead I want every first ball 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.400
 filter cut us off in 67 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.780
 I find it hard to struggle 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 they are embarrassing and after a minute 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.260
 yet another risk depends on yes for 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 what I repeat must enter into 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.720
 head must really grow because 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.000
 then we recommend battle we are also 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.220
 in ten under the ball line we do 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 density we do contrast we do 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.040
 war first ball filter cutters 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.560
 eight players and I do struggle 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.190
 I find it hard to understand now I said it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 especially to the most experienced 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.110
 we really want to believe we want each other 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 to believe 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 however, we must really not only put ourselves 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 in words but with facts 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.229
 it was a real but devastating mix though 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 but beyond doubt, however, no doubt 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.140
 however in series b this difference does not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.000
 there never was us for example in verona 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 we had done while also losing with a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 first minute problem we had done one 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 great game I remember the second 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.070
 however, there may not be time with Padua 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.080
 that we are so gritty so eager 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.540
 then the Verona will be even stronger though 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.430
 if there is only one shirt on a cross 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.280
 yellow we are in three he takes it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.580
 there is something in the players' heads 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.370
 which does not square bike must must 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.170
 we must find the desire for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.410
 fight because otherwise you don't go by 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 no part I still see the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.700
 hope to be saved
