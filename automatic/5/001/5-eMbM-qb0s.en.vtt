transferring titles a little bit

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.900 
transferring titles a little bit
different<00:00:49.360> than<00:00:49.510> doing<00:00:49.660> real<00:00:49.960> estate<00:00:50.910> working

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910

on a bunch of spaces with the park is
also<00:00:54.790> something<00:00:55.239> unique<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:56.040> this<00:00:57.040> type<00:00:57.190> of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
also something unique to this type of

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.920 
also something unique to this type of
project<00:00:57.670> but<00:00:57.820> anyway<00:00:58.480> we<00:00:58.600> wouldn't<00:00:58.870> be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
project but anyway we wouldn't be

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.270 
project but anyway we wouldn't be
investing<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.409> it<00:00:59.559> unless<00:00:59.710> we<00:00:59.949> thought<00:01:00.129> that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
investing in it unless we thought that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.250 
investing in it unless we thought that
it<00:01:00.370> would<00:01:00.489> be<00:01:00.519> something<00:01:01.120> really<00:01:01.390> great<00:01:01.809> for

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
it would be something really great for

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.649

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
as we go through this it's probably

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.050 
as we go through this it's probably
going<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.890> take<00:01:06.070> us<00:01:06.220> about<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.490> month<00:01:06.760> or<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:06.909> to

we'll be showing you all of the details

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.350 
we'll be showing you all of the details
of<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:14.860> we<00:01:15.340> go<00:01:15.460> along<00:01:15.490> through<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.970> project

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
of it as we go along through the project

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.570 
of it as we go along through the project
now<00:01:16.930> we're<00:01:17.170> talking<00:01:17.560> about<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.010> details<00:01:18.400> at

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
now we're talking about the details at

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.960 
now we're talking about the details at
the<00:01:18.610> front<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.030> for<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.360> mobile<00:01:19.930> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the front of this for this mobile it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.520 
the front of this for this mobile it's
probably<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.120> most<00:01:22.330> important<00:01:22.810> part<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.229> this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
probably the most important part of this

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.600 
probably the most important part of this
project<00:01:23.950> because<00:01:24.010> it's<00:01:24.220> going<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.370> show<00:01:24.460> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
project because it's going to show the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.210 
project because it's going to show the
street<00:01:25.120> value<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.560> curb<00:01:26.800> appeal<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
street value and the curb appeal and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.580 
street value and the curb appeal and
that's<00:01:28.180> where<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.450> major<00:01:28.660> transformation<00:01:29.470> is

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
that's where the major transformation is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.890 
that's where the major transformation is
obviously<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.160> mobile<00:01:30.490> home<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.760> not<00:01:30.910> real<00:01:31.480> deep

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
obviously a mobile home is not real deep

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.990 
obviously a mobile home is not real deep
I<00:01:32.140> mean<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.470> there<00:01:32.620> real<00:01:32.800> deep<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.850> just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
I mean it's there real deep but you just

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.040 
I mean it's there real deep but you just
can't<00:01:34.240> put<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.420> whole<00:01:34.540> lot<00:01:34.660> of<00:01:34.690> trim<00:01:34.930> and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
can't put a whole lot of trim and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.450 
can't put a whole lot of trim and
details<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.620> them<00:01:35.770> especially<00:01:35.980> when<00:01:36.280> there's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
details on them especially when there's

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.890 
details on them especially when there's
other<00:01:36.760> mobile<00:01:37.150> homes<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.600> are<00:01:37.660> on<00:01:37.750> either

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
other mobile homes that are on either

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.050 
other mobile homes that are on either
side<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.160> front<00:01:39.400> is<00:01:39.640> going<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.910> be

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
side of it so the front is going to be

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.940 
side of it so the front is going to be
super<00:01:40.780> important<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.170> front<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.680> deck

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
super important the front and the deck

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.040 
super important the front and the deck
so<00:01:42.790> anyway<00:01:43.060> Tony<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.480> out<00:01:43.600> taking<00:01:43.930> some

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
so anyway Tony is out taking some

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.770 
so anyway Tony is out taking some
measurements<00:01:44.260> right<00:01:44.500> now<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.270> face<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.510> it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
measurements right now on the face of it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.180 
measurements right now on the face of it
because<00:01:47.290> we're<00:01:47.410> gonna<00:01:47.500> transform<00:01:47.980> we're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
because we're gonna transform we're

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.740 
because we're gonna transform we're
gonna<00:01:48.310> do<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> hot<00:01:48.700> shelf<00:01:49.000> work<00:01:49.210> we're<00:01:49.420> gonna<00:01:49.480> do

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
gonna do a hot shelf work we're gonna do

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.250

shutters we're gonna do custom columns
and<00:01:53.260> just<00:01:53.710> transform<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.670> front<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.030> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
and just transform the front of this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.880 
and just transform the front of this
place<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.630> much<00:01:55.660> as<00:01:55.930> we<00:01:56.050> possibly<00:01:56.230> can<00:01:56.680> we're

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
place as much as we possibly can we're
