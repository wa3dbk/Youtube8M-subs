00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.000
 spring this year, though earlier but very 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.280
 changeable and still preserved 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.950
 the threat of night frosts but in our 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.860
 polycarbonate coated greenhouses 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.410
 actual bio and air and soil already 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.140
 warm enough to such an extent 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.570
 that we can begin today 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.820
 planting tomato seedlings bio layer 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 transform hard ultraviolet 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.379
 sun radiation useful for plants 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.960
 red spectrum light as a result 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.330
 reduced ripening rises 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.489
 yield and vitamin content in 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.220
 fruits depending on the cultivated 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.470
 culture actual bio allows you to get 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.809
 up to one hundred and sixty percent more 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.420
 harvest to seedlings 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.360
 felt good we formed 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.420
 the wells spilled their water and now 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.299
 proceed directly to landing at 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.280
 planting, in principle, seedlings can be a bit 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.860
 deepen this will contribute to 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.439
 what is better from growing roots 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.320
 generally in a greenhouse covered with actual white 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.060
 optimal plant conditions are created 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.229
 protected not only from a sharp drop 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.409
 temperatures 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.310
 but from the wind from the rain from the low 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.100
 temperatures 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.499
 Well, among other things, actual bio 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.020
 contributes to the fact that the plants 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.329
 improves the process of photosynthesis 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.640
 thanks to the unique white layer which 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.289
 applied on polycarbonate for all 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.469
 unique characteristics 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.780
 actual bio retains all the benefits and 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.030
 ecological quality of cellular 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.249
 polycarbonate and will serve you no less 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.649
 ten years with such a coating 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.929
 the plant is not afraid of any night drops 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.609
 temperatures no city no wind 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.369
 and thanks to heat-saving properties 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.740
 magician albea we will be able to harvest 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.119
 down until late autumn in the greenhouse 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.090
 covered bio actual 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.909
 seedlings can be planted earlier than usual 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.939
 and harvest up to 2 and a half times 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.939
 more
