00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.850
 good afternoon, we are 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.140
 sports dynamo in krylatskom where today 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.780
 denis lebedev won convincing 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.190
 victory over swarm johns junior knockout 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 denis will tell what was yours 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.410
 Feel after a fight to be honest, I say 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.099
 did not even expect what will happen when 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.640
 will end in principle my was very 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.040
 heavy and I tried every round 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 of all forces there was even one moment such 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.610
 the turning point where I felt that I was tired 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.350
 and gasoline runs out 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.149
 and then I remembered a little bit already 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 talked about the press conference remembered 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.579
 fights with marco hook as i was going 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.469
 last round he was given the victory I knew 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.449
 that in this battle there will be no gift either 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 even though we are at your home but even thunder 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.589
 in two I will not give up because paradise 2 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.250
 whatever the notes 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.489
 all the same 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.089
 even one judge gave a draw as far as 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.730
 I know one with a small break with 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.449
 small 1 in combat use 2 already a little 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.320
 more gap 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.880
 that is, the fight was such 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 want said i lost 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.170
 three rounds 3 with all that I and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.890
 I myself felt the round which I lost 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.960
 I myself feel but here at the end a little bit 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.780
 worked 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 so much so that he will rest in peace 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 remembered what I was going through let's do it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330
 modifying need to earn here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 so apparently ended talk about 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.420
 the last seconds of the tenth round 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.550
 once already spent my series and it was 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 it is clear that the swarm has already sat down in the final blow 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.030
 you feel it is necessary to carry out 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.330
 there was no doubt or 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.190
 if you saw i stopped look at 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.240
 the judge 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:52.710
 the stop command was not I hit let's say so 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.420
 not half heartedly I thought it would be 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 much all these would have opened an account before 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.509
 he may be so long and not lying 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 everything has a contract is signed home and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.709
 there it itself is immediately specified if 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 the person did not fall the account does not open if 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.080
 would be a swarm at least was on his knee 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 restored the battle would begin by this 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.110
 didn't some boxers do it 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.720
 for the stomach on feeling with the previous will 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.530
 with marco hook which formed more what 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.070
 more difficult to access to just about somewhere 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.990
 probably the same I was very upset 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.050
 for this fight of course 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 also on that one just having done 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.430
 conclusions and that fight 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.230
 went up to this fight differently and 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 develops mastery from fight to fight 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.060
 if a person overcomes difficulties to him 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.450
 next fight is easier and if he 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 light lung light sweat 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.230
 he stops anyway
