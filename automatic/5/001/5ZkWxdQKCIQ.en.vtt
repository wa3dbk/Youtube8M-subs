00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you're going to i'm going to be

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.429 
you're going to i'm going to be
basically<00:00:22.949> focusing<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.789> true<00:00:24.090> turns<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
basically focusing on true turns and you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.609 
basically focusing on true turns and you
know<00:00:26.310> mainly<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.439> other

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
know mainly that because in the other

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.759 
know mainly that because in the other
one<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.130> didn't<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.990> using<00:00:31.320> mo<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
one I really didn't so I'm using mo to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.280 
one I really didn't so I'm using mo to
wear<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> throttle<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.780> if

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
wear this is throttle right now so if

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
wear this is throttle right now so if
you<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.800> mode<00:00:34.980> 1<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> everything<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.790> be

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you use in mode 1 and everything will be

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
you use in mode 1 and everything will be
a<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.180> different<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.719> you'll<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> point

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a bit different but you'll get the point

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
a bit different but you'll get the point
so<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.790> doing<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> turn<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.840> I'll<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.140> my

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so I'm doing a turn here I'll put my

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959

bit further over here and just do it
nice<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.000> slow<00:01:46.270> there's<00:01:46.600> no<00:01:46.750> rush<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.920> know

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
nice and slow there's no rush you know

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.380 
nice and slow there's no rush you know
you<00:01:48.160> can<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.610> little<00:01:48.760> one<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.150> that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
you can just do a little one like that

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.200 
you can just do a little one like that
it<00:01:50.230> was<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.410> really<00:01:50.650> good<00:01:50.980> charm<00:01:51.280> but<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.030> can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
it was a really good charm but you can

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.510 
it was a really good charm but you can
know<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.690> do<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.230> starting<00:01:53.710> or<00:01:54.430> you

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
know you can do that for starting or you

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.590 
know you can do that for starting or you
can<00:01:54.700> start<00:01:54.970> getting<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.180> bit<00:01:55.330> more<00:01:55.480> aggressive

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
can start getting a bit more aggressive

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.810 
can start getting a bit more aggressive
and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.610> know<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.960> some<00:01:58.990> fun<00:01:59.320> with<00:01:59.500> it

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and you know just have some fun with it

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.700 
and you know just have some fun with it
so<00:02:00.820> once<00:02:01.150> you've<00:02:01.300> done<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.510> few<00:02:01.750> easy<00:02:01.990> terms<00:02:02.320> go

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
so once you've done a few easy terms go

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.090 
so once you've done a few easy terms go
ahead<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.720> keep<00:02:04.720> flying<00:02:05.110> I'll<00:02:05.440> try<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.890> few

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
ahead and keep flying I'll try a few

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.430 
ahead and keep flying I'll try a few
harder<00:02:06.369> ones<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.900> know<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.350> do

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
harder ones see you know you can do

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.090 
harder ones see you know you can do
something<00:02:08.679> when<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:09.580> tricky<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:11.100> we

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
something when it's tricky like this we

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.090 
something when it's tricky like this we
do<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.280> multiple<00:02:12.820> terms<00:02:13.209> inside<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> church

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
do a multiple terms inside of a church

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.640 
do a multiple terms inside of a church
um<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:16.090> kind<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.540> hard<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.990> really<00:02:17.170> work<00:02:17.470> out

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
um it kind of is hard to really work out

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.100 
um it kind of is hard to really work out
but<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.220> get<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> point<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.720> know<00:02:19.870> try

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
but you get the point you know try

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.840 
but you get the point you know try
different<00:02:20.140> directions<00:02:20.890> try<00:02:21.190> multiple<00:02:21.580> turns

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
different directions try multiple turns

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.210 
different directions try multiple turns
at<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> same<00:02:22.300> time<00:02:22.530> try<00:02:23.530> doing<00:02:23.740> them<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
at the same time try doing them with the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.000 
at the same time try doing them with the
tail<00:02:24.490> just<00:02:24.520> facing<00:02:25.120> out<00:02:25.270> first<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.770> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
tail just facing out first and then that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
tail just facing out first and then that
you<00:02:27.220> can<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.880> know<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.239> knows<00:02:28.450> them<00:02:28.720> because

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
you can you know do knows them because

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.199 
you can you know do knows them because
when<00:02:29.950> your<00:02:30.100> tails<00:02:30.310> facing<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.120> be

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
when your tails facing it's going to be

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.150 
when your tails facing it's going to be
quite<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.420> bit<00:02:31.630> easier<00:02:31.959> I'm<00:02:32.500> not<00:02:32.800> really<00:02:32.920> doing

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
quite a bit easier I'm not really doing

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.979 
quite a bit easier I'm not really doing
a<00:02:33.310> turner<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.760> ever<00:02:33.880> yeah<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.600> get<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> point

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
a turner and ever yeah you get a point

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.350 
a turner and ever yeah you get a point
and<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.980> know<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:36.940> these<00:02:37.739> so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and you know you do one of these so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.280 
and you know you do one of these so
that's<00:02:40.360> pretty<00:02:40.690> good<00:02:40.900> turn<00:02:41.200> there<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:44.140> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
that's pretty good turn there and you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.820 
that's pretty good turn there and you
notice<00:02:44.620> keep<00:02:45.010> her<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.610> practicing<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.470> once

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
notice keep her you practicing so once

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.030 
notice keep her you practicing so once
you<00:02:47.950> get<00:02:48.070> doing<00:02:48.340> some<00:02:48.519> faster<00:02:48.970> ones<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.239> that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you get doing some faster ones like that

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.240 
you get doing some faster ones like that
so<00:02:51.040> it'll<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.550> fun<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:53.190> practices<00:02:54.190> that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
so it'll be fun of the practices that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.990 
so it'll be fun of the practices that
heated<00:02:54.880> us<00:02:55.110> anything<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:57.280> know<00:02:57.430> lean<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.880> on

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
heated us anything you know lean in on

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
some of the turns and that's when it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.699 
some of the turns and that's when it
gets<00:02:59.410> really<00:02:59.650> fun<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.130> fast<00:03:00.340> fast<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
sometimes you have to get a bit of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.789 
sometimes you have to get a bit of
momentum<00:03:10.269> before<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.989> start<00:03:11.230> doing<00:03:11.349> them<00:03:11.560> for

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
momentum before you start doing them for

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.130 
momentum before you start doing them for
