00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.640
 the use of rice paper does not 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 ends here 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260
 in fact we will apply it on a shirt 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 of white cotton after always having the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.099
 subject we rest in the position 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
 choice 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.640
 we use to glue the paper in a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.289
 medium for fabric 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's start with a soft brush a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 put the product directly on the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.880
 uniformly and fairly fabric 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880
 brilliant 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.949
 it was always the same way we take the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 medium over paper who having one 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.239
 thicker than linen provaglio 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 the ritual card will adhere well to the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.890
 fabrics no difference in the phase 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.890
 final and that will remain a policy 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.550
 there 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 and why love a butterfly well 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.470
 always cut out with affection the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.050
 gluing process supervised and 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.820
 come with the brush with glue for 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.670
 avoid the subject later 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.790
 we know that especially the edges are the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.050
 parts that will tend to lift 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.540
 let it dry well for about 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.160
 four hours and fix the card with a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.710
 iron without steam a 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.900
 cotton temperature we protect the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.619
 drawing with a cloth and we draft for 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.619
 a few minutes 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.680
 now we highlight the villages of 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.979
 decorating those colors in the tube 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.290
 glitterati suitable for resting we can 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.720
 give various colors to highlight demi 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.430
 how we like it the most 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.800
 after a few hours the colors will be 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.110
 dried and water will be put into 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.110
 highlight with very bright colors 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.550
 now we will have to fix with iron from 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 even ironing these check that 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.800
 they fade themselves forward 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.630
 here is the final result a simple one 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.400
 anonymous white t-shirt was 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.400
 custom believed
