considering how well the 3s is doing but
is<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.820> takes

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
at first glance the answer looks to be a

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.760 
at first glance the answer looks to be a
giant<00:00:14.700> yes<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.839> like<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> last<00:00:16.260> generation

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
decent light you can take an okay

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.170 
decent light you can take an okay
snapshot<00:03:17.069> but<00:03:17.370> beyond<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.090> not

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
snapshot but beyond that it's really not

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.030 
snapshot but beyond that it's really not
going<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.480> worth<00:03:18.630> much<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> video<00:03:19.980> is

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
going to be worth much but the video is

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440 
going to be worth much but the video is
actually<00:03:20.459> kind<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.670> decent<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.329> does

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
actually kind of decent so it does

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.809 
actually kind of decent so it does
record<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.959> 480p<00:03:22.410> at<00:03:22.769> 30<00:03:23.010> frames<00:03:23.250> per<00:03:23.370> second

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
so everything's nice and smooth as you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199 
so everything's nice and smooth as you
can<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.829> in<00:03:26.040> good<00:03:26.280> light<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.639> not<00:03:26.700> too<00:03:27.000> bad

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
can see in good light it's not too bad

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.789 
can see in good light it's not too bad
it<00:03:27.750> over<00:03:27.870> both<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.109> Stills<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.739> video

checkerboard pattern pretty much all the

which<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.750> bit<00:05:04.960> odd<00:05:05.140> considering<00:05:05.560> just<00:05:05.830> how

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
which is a bit odd considering just how

well the rest of the Vita is built I'm
willing<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.380> bet<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.530> I'm<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.920> unlucky<00:05:09.070> but

willing to bet that I'm just unlucky but

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.920 
willing to bet that I'm just unlucky but
it<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.880> something<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.270> consider

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
it is something to consider

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.590 
it is something to consider
