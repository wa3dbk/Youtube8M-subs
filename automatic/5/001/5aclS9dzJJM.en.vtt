00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
craft one of these things which is a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
craft one of these things which is a
tree<00:00:44.100> station<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
tree station and the way you do that is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
tree station and the way you do that is
by<00:00:46.020> surrounding<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> ironing<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.270> some

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
by surrounding and ironing it with some

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
by surrounding and ironing it with some
oak<00:00:48.629> wood<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> regular<00:00:49.920> workbench<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> then

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
oak wood in a regular workbench and then

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
oak wood in a regular workbench and then
voila<00:00:51.329> you'll<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> crease<00:00:52.379> station<00:00:52.710> that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
voila you'll get a crease station that's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
voila you'll get a crease station that's
what<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.309> using<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.640> most

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

to<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.579> few<00:01:44.700> minutes<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> glowstone

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to in just a few minutes and glowstone

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
to in just a few minutes and glowstone
and<00:01:46.290> nether<00:01:46.829> quartz<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.490> require

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and nether quartz would also require

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
and nether quartz would also require
another<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:49.950> there

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
another thing as well and from there

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.359 
another thing as well and from there
you'll<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.140> these<00:01:52.259> different<00:01:52.770> types

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you'll get all of these different types

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069 
you'll get all of these different types
of<00:01:53.520> saplings<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.600> above<00:01:54.810> blocks

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of saplings the the above blocks

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
of saplings the the above blocks
correspond<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.189> down<00:01:56.460> below

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
correspond to what they are down below

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690 
correspond to what they are down below
here<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.469> on<00:01:58.469> top<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.770> those<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.130> also<00:01:59.310> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
here and on top of those we also have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.330 
here and on top of those we also have
the<00:02:00.180> experience<00:02:00.810> tree<00:02:01.140> which<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.950> requires

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the experience tree which just requires

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.929 
the experience tree which just requires
a<00:02:02.600> interesting<00:02:03.600> crafting<00:02:04.020> recipe<00:02:04.790> well<00:02:05.790> it's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
a interesting crafting recipe well it's

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
a interesting crafting recipe well it's
based<00:02:06.119> upon<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.570> killing<00:02:06.840> mobs<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.229> get

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
based upon you know killing mobs you get

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
based upon you know killing mobs you get
experience<00:02:07.649> from<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.610> hence<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
experience from that so hence the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.059 
experience from that so hence the
crafting<00:02:09.720> recipe<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.860> all

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
crafting recipe here so we have all

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.949 
crafting recipe here so we have all
these<00:02:11.370> different<00:02:11.730> types<00:02:12.270> twelve<00:02:12.720> different

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
these different types twelve different

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.060 
these different types twelve different
trees<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:13.590> two

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
trees in two

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.350 
trees in two
and<00:02:14.810> here<00:02:15.810> they<00:02:15.960> all<00:02:16.110> are<00:02:16.140> laid<00:02:17.130> out<00:02:17.360> lovely

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and here they all are laid out lovely

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.220 
and here they all are laid out lovely
over<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:20.400> guess<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.030> could<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:21.450> chop

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
over here and I guess we could just chop

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
over here and I guess we could just chop
a<00:02:22.500> few<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.070> down<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.880> get<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
a few of them down just so we get a I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.660 
a few of them down just so we get a I
know<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.990> basic<00:02:25.260> idea<00:02:25.680> well<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.100> guess<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.550> run

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
know a basic idea well I guess I can run

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.400 
know a basic idea well I guess I can run
through<00:02:26.850> them<00:02:26.940> first<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.330> pumpkin<00:02:27.780> then

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
through them first this is pumpkin then

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.390 
through them first this is pumpkin then
we<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.650> iron<00:02:28.890> gold<00:02:29.730> coal<00:02:30.530> redstone<00:02:31.530> diamonds

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
we have iron gold coal redstone diamonds

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.750 
we have iron gold coal redstone diamonds
emeralds<00:02:33.140> XP<00:02:34.140> tree<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.100> have<00:02:35.220> some<00:02:35.400> quartz

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
emeralds XP tree and we have some quartz

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.070 
emeralds XP tree and we have some quartz
glowstone<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:38.040> obsidian<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.510> they're

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
glowstone and and obsidian so they're

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.530 
glowstone and and obsidian so they're
all<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> laid<00:02:41.220> them<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.520> separate<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
all I laid them out separate for a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
all I laid them out separate for a
reason<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.500> what<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.920> start<00:02:44.160> off<00:02:44.280> by

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
reason but what we can start off by

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.070 
reason but what we can start off by
doing<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.600> we'll<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.960> grab

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
doing is I don't know we'll just grab

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.040 
doing is I don't know we'll just grab
why<00:02:46.440> don't<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.680> grab<00:02:46.800> some<00:02:47.270> some<00:02:48.270> gold<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.810> in

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
why don't we grab some some gold I'm in

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.690 
why don't we grab some some gold I'm in
creative<00:02:49.290> mode<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.680> should<00:02:49.980> probably<00:02:50.190> switch

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
creative mode I should probably switch

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880 
creative mode I should probably switch
out<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.180> game<00:02:51.960> mode<00:02:52.170> survival<00:02:52.410> that's

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
out of that game mode survival that's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.490 
out of that game mode survival that's
why<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> axe<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.880> let's<00:02:54.120> grab<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
why I have the axe so let's grab a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.170 
why I have the axe so let's grab a
couple<00:02:55.500> gold<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.640> because<00:02:56.790> why<00:02:57.150> not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
couple gold here just because why not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.200 
couple gold here just because why not
and<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.620> don't<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.460> can<00:02:59.610> also<00:02:59.760> grab

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
and then I don't know we can also grab

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.280 
and then I don't know we can also grab
how<00:03:00.480> about<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.780> diamonds<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> know

that<00:03:37.070> alright<00:03:38.270> cool<00:03:39.270> beans

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
that alright cool beans

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.290 
that alright cool beans
okay<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.560> now<00:03:40.800> we've<00:03:40.950> got<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.490> woodshop<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.270> a

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
okay so now we've got a woodshop for a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.320 
okay so now we've got a woodshop for a
bunch<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.660> different<00:03:43.350> types<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.680> trees<00:03:43.860> and

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
bunch of different types of trees and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.910 
bunch of different types of trees and
well<00:03:45.330> how<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.600> we<00:03:45.690> actually<00:03:46.230> turn<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.650> into

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
well how do we actually turn this into

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.200 
well how do we actually turn this into
the<00:03:47.010> resource<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.400> we're<00:03:47.610> trying<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> get<00:03:47.940> so

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
the resource that we're trying to get so

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.420 
the resource that we're trying to get so
we<00:03:48.330> need<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.540> come<00:03:48.660> over<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.400> we've<00:03:50.400> got

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
we need to come over here and we've got

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
we need to come over here and we've got
these<00:03:51.020> transformers<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.680> got<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> base

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
these transformers so you got a base

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.730 
these transformers so you got a base
transformer<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.630> base<00:03:54.840> transformer<00:03:55.590> is

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
transformer and the base transformer is

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.830 
transformer and the base transformer is
well<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:56.700> crafted<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.450> coal<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
well it's crafted with the coal the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.930 
well it's crafted with the coal the
slimeball<00:03:58.440> iron<00:03:58.740> ingot<00:03:58.980> diamond<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.640> gold

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
slimeball iron ingot diamond and gold

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.440 
slimeball iron ingot diamond and gold
and<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:01.860> applies<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.640> all<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> trees

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
and this one applies to all of the trees

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.920 
and this one applies to all of the trees
I<00:04:03.480> had<00:04:03.930> laid<00:04:04.230> out<00:04:04.260> over<00:04:05.070> here<00:04:05.840> including<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
I had laid out over here including the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.570 
I had laid out over here including the
experience<00:04:07.590> tree<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:07.920> also<00:04:08.190> we've<00:04:08.430> got<00:04:08.460> some

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
experience tree and also we've got some

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.040 
experience tree and also we've got some
saplings<00:04:09.150> dropping<00:04:09.540> which<00:04:09.690> you'll<00:04:09.930> notice

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
saplings dropping which you'll notice

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.590 
saplings dropping which you'll notice
you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.530> actually<00:04:10.880> continue<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.390> you

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
you can actually continue you can you

lot of a lot of diamonds a lot of
emeralds<00:04:16.320> using<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.130> method<00:04:17.549> for<00:04:17.700> only<00:04:17.820> a

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
emeralds using this method for only a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.550 
emeralds using this method for only a
very<00:04:18.690> cheap<00:04:18.989> startup<00:04:19.440> cost<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.400> 8<00:04:21.560> so

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
very cheap startup cost of of 8 so

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.920 
very cheap startup cost of of 8 so
anyway<00:04:23.340> yeah<00:04:23.640> we're<00:04:23.790> getting<00:04:24.360> some<00:04:24.540> sapling

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
anyway yeah we're getting some sapling

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.150 
anyway yeah we're getting some sapling
drops<00:04:25.169> from<00:04:25.350> it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
drops from it

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.980 
drops from it
but<00:04:26.310> uh<00:04:26.340> yeah<00:04:26.940> all<00:04:26.970> these<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.960> the

but uh yeah all these up to the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.200 
but uh yeah all these up to the
experience<00:04:28.530> tree<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:29.220> can<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.850> can<00:04:29.970> convert

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
experience tree you can you can convert

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.270 
experience tree you can you can convert
using<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.930> regular<00:04:31.200> transformer<00:04:31.740> then

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
using the the regular transformer then

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.360 
using the the regular transformer then
the<00:04:32.730> nether<00:04:32.940> stuff<00:04:33.330> over<00:04:33.750> here<00:04:33.830> requires<00:04:34.830> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
the nether stuff over here requires the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.090 
the nether stuff over here requires the
nether<00:04:35.940> transformer<00:04:36.750> which<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.620> crafted<00:04:38.010> by

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
nether transformer which is crafted by

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.590 
nether transformer which is crafted by
surrounding<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.610> regular<00:04:38.910> transformer<00:04:39.450> in

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
surrounding the regular transformer in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.090 
surrounding the regular transformer in
nether<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.900> key<00:04:40.050> at<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.350> nether<00:04:40.530> transformer

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
nether a key at the nether transformer

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.220 
nether a key at the nether transformer
from<00:04:41.190> there<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.700> then<00:04:42.180> finally<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.870> order<00:04:43.140> to

actually harvest the obsidian we need
the<00:04:45.840> reinforced<00:04:46.880> transformer<00:04:47.880> which<00:04:48.030> is

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
the reinforced transformer which is

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.430 
the reinforced transformer which is
crafted<00:04:48.510> with<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.660> regular<00:04:48.960> transformer

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
crafted with the regular transformer

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.560 
crafted with the regular transformer
surrounded<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:49.920> some<00:04:50.070> diamonds<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.640> some

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
surrounded in some diamonds and some

can do whatever we want with the mod so
let's<00:04:55.830> go<00:04:55.950> into<00:04:56.280> our<00:04:56.310> our<00:04:57.000> tree<00:04:57.210> station<00:04:57.600> oh<00:04:57.720> by

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
let's go into our our tree station oh by

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.660 
let's go into our our tree station oh by
the<00:04:57.990> way<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.230> did<00:04:58.800> forget<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.160> mention<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.460> all

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
the way I did forget to mention that all

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.490 
the way I did forget to mention that all
these<00:04:59.790> crafting<00:05:00.150> recipes<00:05:00.450> here<00:05:00.660> these<00:05:01.230> are

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
these crafting recipes here these are

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.860 
these crafting recipes here these are
done<00:05:01.890> in<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.610> tree<00:05:02.790> station<00:05:03.210> not<00:05:03.510> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
done in the in the tree station not a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.750 
done in the in the tree station not a
regular<00:05:04.380> workbench<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:05.280> if<00:05:05.370> we<00:05:05.460> go<00:05:05.550> over<00:05:05.730> here

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
regular workbench so if we go over here

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.060 
regular workbench so if we go over here
into<00:05:06.210> our<00:05:06.330> tree<00:05:06.570> station<00:05:06.990> well<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:07.620> first<00:05:07.740> want

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
into our tree station well we first want

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.220 
into our tree station well we first want
to<00:05:08.130> do<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.520> we<00:05:08.790> want<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.090> combine<00:05:09.300> these<00:05:09.810> in

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
to do is we want to combine these in

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.920 
to do is we want to combine these in
order<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.650> make<00:05:11.310> some<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.420> at<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.720> locks

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
order to make some of the at the locks

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.950 
order to make some of the at the locks
so<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.830> recipe<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.030> then<00:05:15.720> for

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
so the recipe is like so and then for

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.090 
so the recipe is like so and then for
every<00:05:16.050> four<00:05:16.380> you're<00:05:16.530> going<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.710> get<00:05:16.830> one<00:05:16.980> log

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
every four you're going to get one log

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.250 
every four you're going to get one log
in<00:05:17.310> return<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:17.760> we<00:05:17.820> got<00:05:17.970> two<00:05:18.240> there<00:05:18.510> we'll<00:05:19.140> get

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
in return so we got two there we'll get

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.700 
in return so we got two there we'll get
some<00:05:19.500> gold<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:19.920> boom<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.120> every<00:05:21.810> every<00:05:22.530> one

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
some gold here boom and every every one

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.770 
some gold here boom and every every one
of<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.950> logs<00:05:23.220> that<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.670> chop<00:05:24.000> down<00:05:24.030> from<00:05:24.660> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
of the logs that you chop down from the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.570 
of the logs that you chop down from the
tree<00:05:25.050> yields<00:05:25.590> anywhere<00:05:25.890> from<00:05:26.040> three<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.460> five

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
tree yields anywhere from three to five

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.570 
tree yields anywhere from three to five
of<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.330> wood<00:05:27.540> shop<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.440> all<00:05:28.920> right<00:05:29.250> some

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
of the wood shop so all right some

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.510 
of the wood shop so all right some
emeralds<00:05:29.970> some<00:05:30.960> XP<00:05:31.500> boom<00:05:32.490> some<00:05:33.090> courts<00:05:33.480> and

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
emeralds some XP boom some courts and

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.270 
emeralds some XP boom some courts and
our<00:05:35.520> obsidian<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:36.900> why<00:05:37.680> don't<00:05:37.830> we<00:05:37.890> start<00:05:38.100> off

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
our obsidian so why don't we start off

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.910 
our obsidian so why don't we start off
with<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> regular<00:05:39.560> transformer<00:05:40.560> so

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
with just the regular transformer so

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.640 
with just the regular transformer so
with<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.370> we<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.730> do<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.270> goal<00:05:42.450> so<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.260> can

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
with that we can do the goal so you can

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.290 
with that we can do the goal so you can
put<00:05:43.890> anywhere<00:05:44.250> from<00:05:44.370> one<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.940> eight<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.240> the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
put anywhere from one to eight of the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.150 
put anywhere from one to eight of the
logs<00:05:45.480> in<00:05:45.750> here<00:05:45.990> along<00:05:46.500> with<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.680> transformer

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
logs in here along with the transformer

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.340 
logs in here along with the transformer
and<00:05:47.340> then<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:47.940> will<00:05:48.180> you'll<00:05:48.810> grab<00:05:49.110> the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
and then you will you'll grab the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.680 
and then you will you'll grab the
resources<00:05:49.890> in<00:05:50.130> return<00:05:50.570> transformer<00:05:51.570> will

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
resources in return transformer will

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.570 
resources in return transformer will
stay<00:05:51.900> throughout<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.350> recipe<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:53.460> can

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
stay throughout the recipe and you can

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.370 
stay throughout the recipe and you can
keep<00:05:53.760> on<00:05:53.910> using<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.419> okay<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.020> we<00:05:55.200> got<00:05:55.350> some

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
keep on using it okay so we got some

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.900 
keep on using it okay so we got some
diamonds<00:05:55.890> but<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.130> transformer<00:05:56.580> back<00:05:56.700> in

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
diamonds but the transformer back in

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.670 
diamonds but the transformer back in
transformer<00:05:57.660> can<00:05:57.780> be<00:05:57.900> put<00:05:58.050> out<00:05:58.140> anywhere<00:05:58.500> in

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
transformer can be put out anywhere in

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.680 
transformer can be put out anywhere in
the<00:05:58.800> recipe<00:05:59.070> I<00:05:59.160> should<00:05:59.520> say<00:05:59.700> boom<00:06:00.000> there<00:06:00.360> we<00:06:00.450> go

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
the recipe I should say boom there we go

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.590 
the recipe I should say boom there we go
we've<00:06:01.290> got<00:06:01.500> our<00:06:02.010> emeralds<00:06:02.520> here<00:06:02.910> now<00:06:03.180> let's<00:06:03.390> do

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
we've got our emeralds here now let's do

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440 
we've got our emeralds here now let's do
our<00:06:03.800> XP<00:06:04.800> log<00:06:05.070> because<00:06:05.460> it's<00:06:05.730> it's<00:06:05.970> shapeless

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
our XP log because it's it's shapeless

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.170 
our XP log because it's it's shapeless
crafting<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:07.500> bottles<00:06:08.100> of<00:06:08.220> experience<00:06:08.850> and

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
crafting so bottles of experience and

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.270 
crafting so bottles of experience and
then<00:06:09.900> put<00:06:10.230> it<00:06:10.320> in<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.470> upper<00:06:10.710> right<00:06:10.740> just<00:06:11.130> for

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
then put it in the upper right just for

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.400 
then put it in the upper right just for
the<00:06:11.340> sake<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.550> oh<00:06:11.880> no<00:06:12.090> no<00:06:12.419> no<00:06:12.630> we<00:06:13.020> got<00:06:13.169> a<00:06:13.200> switch

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
the sake of oh no no no we got a switch

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.990 
the sake of oh no no no we got a switch
over<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.740> our<00:06:13.890> nether<00:06:14.160> transformer<00:06:14.700> so<00:06:14.850> for

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
over to our nether transformer so for

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.540 
over to our nether transformer so for
the<00:06:15.060> quartz<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.510> for<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.410> glowstone<00:06:16.919> because

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
the quartz and for the glowstone because

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.159 
the quartz and for the glowstone because
they<00:06:17.669> come<00:06:17.820> from<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:18.090> nether<00:06:18.270> we<00:06:18.630> have<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:18.960> use

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
they come from the nether we have to use

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.020 
they come from the nether we have to use
the<00:06:19.410> other<00:06:19.530> transformer<00:06:20.160> for<00:06:20.340> it<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:20.669> put<00:06:20.880> the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
the other transformer for it so put the

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.030 
the other transformer for it so put the
nether<00:06:21.210> transformer<00:06:21.810> in<00:06:21.900> there<00:06:22.110> put<00:06:22.710> a<00:06:22.740> quartz

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
nether transformer in there put a quartz

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.560 
nether transformer in there put a quartz
log<00:06:23.250> in<00:06:23.490> and<00:06:23.790> then<00:06:23.940> we<00:06:24.060> get<00:06:24.180> some<00:06:24.360> nether

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
log in and then we get some nether

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.060 
log in and then we get some nether
quartz<00:06:24.780> in<00:06:24.990> return<00:06:25.260> for<00:06:25.410> that<00:06:25.530> and<00:06:25.800> then

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
quartz in return for that and then

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.100 
quartz in return for that and then
finally<00:06:26.550> for<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.760> obsidian<00:06:27.600> because<00:06:27.900> it's

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
finally for the obsidian because it's

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.890 
finally for the obsidian because it's
obviously<00:06:28.860> obsidian<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.730> its<00:06:29.850> strong<00:06:30.090> we

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
obviously obsidian and its strong we

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.930 
obviously obsidian and its strong we
throw<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.290> in<00:06:31.380> with<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.940> reinforced

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
throw it in with the the reinforced

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.020 
throw it in with the the reinforced
transformer<00:06:33.720> and<00:06:33.890> we've<00:06:34.890> got<00:06:35.160> a<00:06:35.370> couple<00:06:35.700> of

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
transformer and we've got a couple of

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.220 
transformer and we've got a couple of
obsidian<00:06:36.600> in<00:06:37.400> return<00:06:38.400> so<00:06:39.240> that's<00:06:39.750> that

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
obsidian in return so that's that

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.810 
obsidian in return so that's that
and<00:06:40.320> then<00:06:40.530> of<00:06:40.650> course<00:06:40.680> we've<00:06:41.610> got<00:06:41.670> our

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
and then of course we've got our

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.520 
and then of course we've got our
saplings<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:42.480> if<00:06:42.630> we<00:06:42.750> wanted<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:43.020> just<00:06:43.140> grab<00:06:43.500> a

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
saplings so if we wanted to just grab a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.100 
saplings so if we wanted to just grab a
bit<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:43.890> bone<00:06:44.100> meal<00:06:44.340> here<00:06:44.640> the<00:06:45.150> trees<00:06:45.450> do<00:06:45.750> grow

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
bit of bone meal here the trees do grow

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.490 
bit of bone meal here the trees do grow
up<00:06:46.140> just<00:06:46.890> as<00:06:47.100> a<00:06:47.130> usual<00:06:47.970> tree<00:06:48.270> would<00:06:48.570> so<00:06:49.290> what<00:06:49.410> do

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
up just as a usual tree would so what do

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.750 
up just as a usual tree would so what do
we<00:06:49.560> have<00:06:49.650> here<00:06:50.010> we<00:06:50.130> have<00:06:50.160> a<00:06:50.280> diamond<00:06:50.460> tree

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
we have here we have a diamond tree

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.850 
we have here we have a diamond tree
sapling<00:06:51.030> obviously<00:06:51.660> we<00:06:51.750> we<00:06:52.170> probably<00:06:52.380> want<00:06:52.830> to

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
sapling obviously we we probably want to

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.730 
sapling obviously we we probably want to
plant<00:06:53.160> as<00:06:53.310> many<00:06:53.340> of<00:06:53.670> those<00:06:53.790> as<00:06:53.850> possible<00:06:54.350> so<00:06:55.350> we

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
plant as many of those as possible so we

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.100 
plant as many of those as possible so we
can<00:06:55.920> plant<00:06:56.130> a<00:06:56.190> diamond<00:06:56.550> tree<00:06:56.760> here<00:06:57.240> grow<00:06:57.960> it<00:06:58.050> a

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
can plant a diamond tree here grow it a

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.810 
can plant a diamond tree here grow it a
little<00:06:58.260> bit<00:06:58.410> more<00:06:58.590> and<00:06:58.980> then<00:06:59.280> repeat<00:06:59.790> the

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
little bit more and then repeat the

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.640 
little bit more and then repeat the
process<00:06:59.940> over<00:07:00.480> and<00:07:00.750> over<00:07:00.840> and<00:07:01.230> you've<00:07:01.470> got

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
process over and over and you've got

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.810 
process over and over and you've got
some<00:07:01.980> renewable<00:07:02.760> resources<00:07:03.830> so<00:07:04.830> that's<00:07:05.460> a

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
some renewable resources so that's a

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.730 
some renewable resources so that's a
that's<00:07:06.090> about<00:07:06.330> it<00:07:06.660> for<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.960> mod<00:07:07.140> pretty

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
that's about it for the mod pretty

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.970 
that's about it for the mod pretty
straightforward<00:07:08.490> and<00:07:08.960> again<00:07:09.960> if<00:07:10.260> you<00:07:10.770> feel

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
straightforward and again if you feel

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.490 
straightforward and again if you feel
like<00:07:11.220> staying<00:07:12.150> above<00:07:12.480> ground<00:07:12.720> running

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
like staying above ground running

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.650 
like staying above ground running
through<00:07:13.710> the<00:07:13.860> grassy<00:07:14.580> fields<00:07:15.150> rather<00:07:15.390> than

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
through the grassy fields rather than

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.620 
through the grassy fields rather than
having<00:07:16.290> to<00:07:16.530> stay<00:07:17.190> cooped<00:07:17.520> up<00:07:17.700> in<00:07:17.910> a<00:07:18.000> mine<00:07:18.270> where

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
having to stay cooped up in a mine where

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.590 
having to stay cooped up in a mine where
you've<00:07:19.200> got<00:07:19.440> you<00:07:20.370> know<00:07:20.520> things<00:07:21.240> trying<00:07:21.540> to

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
you've got you know things trying to

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.690 
you've got you know things trying to
kill<00:07:21.840> you<00:07:21.990> and<00:07:22.020> stuff<00:07:22.500> then<00:07:22.980> this<00:07:23.580> is

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700 
kill you and stuff then this is

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.610 
kill you and stuff then this is
something<00:07:24.030> for<00:07:24.150> you<00:07:24.300> to<00:07:24.810> be<00:07:24.930> to<00:07:25.170> be<00:07:25.260> candid

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
something for you to be to be candid

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.290 
something for you to be to be candid
though<00:07:25.740> I<00:07:25.770> think<00:07:26.160> that<00:07:26.400> possibly<00:07:26.730> for<00:07:27.180> like

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
though I think that possibly for like

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.430 
though I think that possibly for like
the<00:07:27.420> diamonds<00:07:27.630> and<00:07:27.870> the<00:07:27.990> emeralds<00:07:28.350> there

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
the diamonds and the emeralds there

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.270 
the diamonds and the emeralds there
could<00:07:28.590> be<00:07:28.620> a<00:07:28.710> little<00:07:28.830> bit<00:07:29.010> of<00:07:29.070> rebalancing

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
could be a little bit of rebalancing

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280 
could be a little bit of rebalancing
because<00:07:29.850> it<00:07:29.970> obviously<00:07:30.270> it<00:07:30.780> does<00:07:31.020> make<00:07:31.260> it

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
because it obviously it does make it

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.290 
because it obviously it does make it
really<00:07:31.800> really<00:07:31.830> easy<00:07:32.340> to<00:07:32.490> get<00:07:32.820> a<00:07:32.880> ton<00:07:33.270> of

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
really really easy to get a ton of

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.200 
really really easy to get a ton of
diamonds<00:07:34.670> especially<00:07:35.670> once<00:07:35.820> you've<00:07:35.940> got<00:07:36.090> the

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
diamonds especially once you've got the

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.610 
diamonds especially once you've got the
saplings<00:07:36.600> and<00:07:36.810> you<00:07:36.870> can<00:07:36.990> plant<00:07:37.200> like<00:07:37.350> a<00:07:37.380> bunch

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
saplings and you can plant like a bunch

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.160 
saplings and you can plant like a bunch
of<00:07:37.710> trees<00:07:37.950> down<00:07:38.300> but<00:07:39.300> other<00:07:39.720> than<00:07:39.840> that<00:07:39.900> I

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.170 
of trees down but other than that I

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.390 
of trees down but other than that I
don't<00:07:40.260> know<00:07:40.350> maybe<00:07:40.530> make<00:07:40.770> the<00:07:40.890> startup<00:07:41.220> cost

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
don't know maybe make the startup cost

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.090 
don't know maybe make the startup cost
diamond<00:07:42.300> blocks<00:07:42.540> just<00:07:42.690> like<00:07:42.960> it's<00:07:43.740> the<00:07:43.920> case

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.100 
diamond blocks just like it's the case

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.910 
diamond blocks just like it's the case
for<00:07:44.400> the<00:07:44.640> the<00:07:44.850> gold<00:07:45.090> and<00:07:45.420> the<00:07:45.480> lapis<00:07:45.840> so<00:07:46.680> on<00:07:46.800> and

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:46.920 
for the the gold and the lapis so on and

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.740 
for the the gold and the lapis so on and
so<00:07:47.040> forth<00:07:47.310> that<00:07:47.970> could<00:07:48.090> rebalance<00:07:48.570> it<00:07:48.690> a

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:48.750 
so forth that could rebalance it a

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.930 
so forth that could rebalance it a
little<00:07:48.930> bit<00:07:49.050> more<00:07:49.200> but<00:07:49.530> yeah<00:07:50.070> on<00:07:50.760> that<00:07:50.820> note

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 
little bit more but yeah on that note

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.390 
little bit more but yeah on that note
hopefully<00:07:51.600> you've<00:07:51.720> enjoyed<00:07:52.050> and<00:07:52.350> if<00:07:52.920> you<00:07:53.190> have

hopefully you've enjoyed and if you have
