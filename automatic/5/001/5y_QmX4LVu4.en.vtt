creative<00:01:46.409> endeavor<00:01:47.070> it'd<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> lot<00:01:47.790> easier

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
creative endeavor it'd be a lot easier

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.090 
creative endeavor it'd be a lot easier
to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.869> tilt<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.649> sitting

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to do that at a tilt and then sitting

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
to do that at a tilt and then sitting
kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:50.939> flat<00:01:51.180> yeah<00:01:51.390> yeah<00:01:51.780> absolutely

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
kind of more flat yeah yeah absolutely

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.999 
kind of more flat yeah yeah absolutely
of<00:01:53.009> course<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> we're<00:01:55.049> probably<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.500> long

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
of course you know we're probably a long

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
of course you know we're probably a long
way<00:01:56.189> away<00:01:56.310> from<00:01:56.399> getting<00:01:57.119> rid<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> our

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
way away from getting rid of our

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
way away from getting rid of our
keyboards<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.790> all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
keyboards in my so we know that not all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
keyboards in my so we know that not all
applications<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:02.009> heavy

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
applications are going to be that heavy

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.789 
applications are going to be that heavy
in<00:02:02.399> touch<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.719> lot<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.140> tasks

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
in touch but there are a lot of tasks

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
in touch but there are a lot of tasks
that<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> day<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> day<00:02:06.360> basis

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
that that we do on a day to day basis

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
that that we do on a day to day basis
like<00:02:06.990> scrolling<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.829> much<00:02:08.399> more

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
like scrolling that are much more

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.270 
like scrolling that are much more
user-friendly<00:02:09.080> for<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.590> touch<00:02:10.979> experience

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
user-friendly for a touch experience

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
user-friendly for a touch experience
versus<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> keyboard<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.360> mice<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
versus a keyboard and mice so we see a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.800 
versus a keyboard and mice so we see a
combination<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
combination of

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.890 
combination of
both<00:02:13.959> going<00:02:14.590> forward<00:02:14.950> which<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.400> why<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.720> have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
both going forward which is why we have

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.199 
both going forward which is why we have
the<00:02:17.080> recline<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:18.010> those<00:02:18.160> those<00:02:18.640> applications

the recline for those those applications

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
note is that for this product here we've

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.500 
note is that for this product here we've
incorporated<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:58.030> different<00:02:58.330> touch

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
incorporated a different touch

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.660 
incorporated a different touch
technology<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.920> optical<00:03:00.400> touch

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
technology we have optical touch

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.059 
technology we have optical touch
technology<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.599> what<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.349> does<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.860> it's

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
technology and what that does is it's

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.390 
technology and what that does is it's
it's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.489> very<00:03:03.700> robust<00:03:04.209> touch<00:03:05.080> technology<00:03:05.799> so

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
it's a very robust touch technology so

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.509 
it's a very robust touch technology so
it<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.330> only<00:03:07.510> will<00:03:07.930> recognize<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.650> finger<00:03:09.130> like

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
it not only will recognize a finger like

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.160 
it not only will recognize a finger like
like<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.630> typical<00:03:10.870> touch

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
like you would have on a typical touch

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.140 
like you would have on a typical touch
technology<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.340> also<00:03:12.459> use<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> credit

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
technology but I can also use a credit

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.410 
technology but I can also use a credit
card<00:03:13.480> or<00:03:14.049> any<00:03:14.080> type<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.410> stylus<00:03:15.180> because<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.299> is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
card or any type of stylus because it is

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.319 
card or any type of stylus because it is
camera<00:03:16.750> based<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.489> less<00:03:18.760> defects<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
camera based so you have less defects a

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.270 
camera based so you have less defects a
very<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:20.049> robust<00:03:20.500> solution<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.250> other

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
very very robust solution the other

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.370 
very very robust solution the other
thing<00:03:21.640> about<00:03:21.670> optical<00:03:22.299> touch<00:03:22.480> technology<00:03:23.170> is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
thing about optical touch technology is

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.710 
thing about optical touch technology is
its<00:03:23.950> scalable<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:24.670> no<00:03:24.790> matter<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.359> have<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> 10

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
its scalable so no matter if I have a 10

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.920 
its scalable so no matter if I have a 10
inch<00:03:25.900> screen<00:03:26.109> or<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:27.130> 23<00:03:27.670> inch<00:03:27.700> size<00:03:28.510> screen<00:03:28.810> in

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
inch screen or a 23 inch size screen in

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.160 
inch screen or a 23 inch size screen in
this<00:03:29.049> case<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.609> barely<00:03:30.989> scalable<00:03:31.989> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
this case it's it's barely scalable and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.580 
this case it's it's barely scalable and

side so it's a great great way to
increase<00:04:19.269> productivity<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:20.169> was<00:04:20.620> looking<00:04:20.829> on

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
increase productivity I was looking on

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.599 
increase productivity I was looking on
the<00:04:20.979> back<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.250> looks<00:04:21.370> like<00:04:21.459> there's

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the back it looks like there's

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.180 
the back it looks like there's
DisplayPort<00:04:22.150> DVI<00:04:22.530> USB<00:04:23.530> n<00:04:23.620> which<00:04:23.800> i<00:04:23.890> assume<00:04:23.979> is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
DisplayPort DVI USB n which i assume is

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.460 
DisplayPort DVI USB n which i assume is
probably<00:04:24.460> for<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> webcam

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
probably for the webcam

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.680 
probably for the webcam
and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.800> also<00:04:26.100> audio<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.390> speakers

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
and then also audio in for the speakers

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.750 
and then also audio in for the speakers
yeah<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.290> one<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.650> challenges<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
yeah so one of the challenges in the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.580 
yeah so one of the challenges in the
commercial<00:04:30.180> space<00:04:30.480> with<00:04:31.470> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
commercial space with the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.800 
commercial space with the
consumerization<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.130> IT<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.970> being<00:04:33.300> able<00:04:33.450> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
consumerization of IT is being able to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.110 
consumerization of IT is being able to
address<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.010> needs<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.340> users<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:35.940> also

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
address the needs of users but also

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.510 
address the needs of users but also
address<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.540> needs<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> IT<00:04:37.520> decision

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
address the needs of the IT decision

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.900 
address the needs of the IT decision
makers<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.300> for<00:04:39.510> us<00:04:39.660> we<00:04:40.620> have<00:04:40.860> things<00:04:41.790> like

makers so for us we have things like

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.150 
makers so for us we have things like
DisplayPort<00:04:42.750> DVI<00:04:43.110> connectivity<00:04:43.800> which<00:04:43.950> are

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
DisplayPort DVI connectivity which are

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.190 
DisplayPort DVI connectivity which are
pretty<00:04:44.610> prevalent<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.140> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
pretty prevalent in the in the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.770 
pretty prevalent in the in the
commercial<00:04:46.620> space<00:04:46.770> we<00:04:47.280> also<00:04:47.430> have<00:04:47.780> included

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
commercial space we also have included

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.290 
commercial space we also have included
things<00:04:48.960> like<00:04:49.080> VESA<00:04:49.800> mounting<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.790> said<00:04:51.090> this

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
things like VESA mounting so I said this

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.780 
things like VESA mounting so I said this
design<00:04:51.810> works<00:04:52.200> well<00:04:52.500> with<00:04:52.680> all-in-ones<00:04:53.250> but

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
design works well with all-in-ones but

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.450 
design works well with all-in-ones but
if<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.940> want<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.210> use<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:54.600> on<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.260> stand<00:04:55.710> for
