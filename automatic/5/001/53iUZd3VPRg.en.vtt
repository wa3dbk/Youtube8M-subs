00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.960

 play on the 3ds act new 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 to let 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 Of course, the focus is on the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.899
 bread struggles as in the predecessors 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 thanks to the new boards comes that 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 Mario party are a lot and fast on the way 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 the boards again all different 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 designed and have a playing time 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.100
 between ten and 60 minutes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 next to a ghost falls on the we 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 traveling with a flying carpet 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.939
 or a trip to the rainbow road 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.100
 where our protagonists in small space 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.110
 shuttles will rush through the area 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 us a lot of optical variety 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.920
 offered what nintendo at the optical 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 design is well done 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 live in your game was then yourself 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.390
 So these are classic start target 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 Boards without great renovation a pity 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.009
 nintendo would have more here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 have to plug in the development time 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.850
 biggest innovation that is immediately noticeable 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 that accounts for the stars as well as the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.840
 one could throw coins in older ones 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.369
 to accumulate until the end 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 coins and stars have an advantage 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.619
 get hold of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.240
 there came to the end again right 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.549
 stress on you never predict 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.470
 could who wins we can not 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.810
 explain what has brought nintendo 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 to remove that from the 3ds title 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 in mario party agency you win by 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.689
 you are the first to reach the goal 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.460
 Of course you can do that with you 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.500
 skillful dice and good dice 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.400
 Items you get in the one the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.810
 wins many mini games 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.399
 you can only win one thing 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.330
 between different dice one 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.070
 choose a new one 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.650
 however, this must be dated exactly 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.470
 which dice the player faster into 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.910
 Ziel brings the main focus to Mario 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.190
 party is clearly on the mini 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.720
 play and these are so entertaining and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.760
 as varied as the one from the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 series is used here offers the game 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.340
 a high quality and white too 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.200
 to convince 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.060
 Here are all the functions of the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.700
 3ds completely exploited 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.980
 no matter if the touchscreen is the gyro 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.480
 sensor or the microphone nintendo white 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.550
 just how to get soft and hardware 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.200
 combines well-liked the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.390
 integration of the camera in some 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.240
 mini games with this one even has the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.220
 Possibility to use maps around so that 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.709
 play in your own environment 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.930
 also a mini-game called imposante 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.340
 Imitation was particularly appealing to us 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.290
 Here you have the reputation of the protagonist 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.570
 as fast as possible and as real as 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.490
 possible to roar in the 3ds microphone 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.770
 All in all, mario offers a party 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.760
 agency many minigames the none 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.220
 leave wishes open 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.780
 Mario Party Agency is without ifs and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.370
 but a multiplayer title 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.320
 It also does it alone for a short time 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.239
 time fun, however, draws the game first 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.610
 multiplayer its full potential 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.430
 the biggest advantage is that the game 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.290
 The download play mode supports this 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.480
 Must be in a four player game only 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.100
 one own the module and already can 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.560
 Start the merry cube 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.480
 this big advantage is at the same time 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.970
 also a big disadvantage because there is 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.920
 only one local multiplayer has one 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.300
 no possibility over the internet with 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.100
 However, to play his friends 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.530
 We felt this during our test 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.180
 anything but disturbing one's way 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.910
 often meets friends again 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.070
 Add to that the streetpass function 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.720
 you have this activated you may even 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.580
 fake duels against the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.299
 favorite characters of other players 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.430
 contest 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.709
 from a technical point of view is mario party 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.420
 Agency only raised average though 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.310
 the game is colorful and therefore 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.650
 however, there is a clear air here 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.120
 Above you can play a lot of details 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.549
 recognize, however, also prevails here 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.350
 and as jagged edges especially if you 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.520
 the game characters looks closer 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.500
 that on 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.240
 even the 3d effect is anything but 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.890
 This is not excellent 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.810
 really strong and does not bring any 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.700
 playful advantages in what 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.340
 graphic is not so successful makes the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.290
 Sound has made up for every game board 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.210
 your own background music immediately 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.490
 goes into the ear and always to the optical 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.920
 presentation fits the ghost falls zb 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.260
 drown something sinister sounds during the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.660
 item empire, on the other hand, cheerful and 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.130
 serene sounds from the boxes come alongside 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.930
 the genius background music 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.730
 the game offers no further 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.400
 speech output except the classical ones 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.530
 cry for marion co, there is only 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 the speaker but unfortunately this can only 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.670
 a few words like the end or newer 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.920
 Record say a pity because this would have 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.450
 the game can loosen up a lot 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.280
 you are looking for one 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.440
 entertaining game they play with 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.000
 your friends can play on the 3ds 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.190
 then you should mario party 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.320
 setting agency, however, he wanted a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.910
 play this game alone 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.720
 then you should make a big bow 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.360
 do it 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.530
 with the download play you have a lot 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.530
 fun and it knows how to convince
