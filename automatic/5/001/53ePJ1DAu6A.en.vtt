can<00:05:21.190> go<00:05:21.310> all<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.550> way<00:05:21.729> out<00:05:21.849> to<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.509> splits

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
can go all the way out to the splits

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.450 
can go all the way out to the splits
position<00:05:23.490> we<00:05:24.490> have<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.669> very<00:05:24.909> high<00:05:25.270> knee<00:05:25.990> bend

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
position we have a very high knee bend

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.879 
position we have a very high knee bend
and<00:05:27.479> we<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:29.610> forward<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.639> back<00:05:30.819> motion<00:05:31.889> on

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
and we have a forward and back motion on

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.600 
and we have a forward and back motion on
that<00:05:33.789> foot<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:35.139> heel<00:05:35.620> spur<00:05:36.009> is<00:05:36.280> locked

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
that foot and the heel spur is locked

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.450 
that foot and the heel spur is locked
into<00:05:36.789> place<00:05:36.969> so<00:05:37.270> there's<00:05:37.449> no<00:05:37.690> pivots<00:05:38.199> or

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
into place so there's no pivots or

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.980 
into place so there's no pivots or
rotation<00:05:39.460> there<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:40.000> personally<00:05:40.599> think<00:05:40.750> this

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
rotation there I personally think this

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.320 
rotation there I personally think this
is<00:05:41.169> quite<00:05:41.409> a<00:05:41.440> fun<00:05:41.740> series<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.370> bots<00:05:42.669> look<00:05:43.000> fun
