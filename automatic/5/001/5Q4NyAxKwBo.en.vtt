the Department of Energy came here and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.270 
the Department of Energy came here and
it<00:00:09.780> just<00:00:09.960> didn't<00:00:10.139> happen<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.860> right

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
it just didn't happen to be the right

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.820 
it just didn't happen to be the right
day<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.870> he<00:00:12.870> actually<00:00:13.080> didn't<00:00:13.469> get<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> see

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830

inside of our tanks you get to kind of
feel<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.879> pipes<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.390> people

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
feel for it we do have pipes that people

feel for it we do have pipes that people
have<00:00:48.780> dropped<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> tanks<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> years

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
have dropped in the tanks over the years

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.369 

we<00:00:55.370> studied<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.120> we<00:00:56.390> actually<00:00:56.899> have<00:00:57.079> spent

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
we studied and we actually have spent

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.950 
we studied and we actually have spent
quite<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.710> bit<00:00:57.829> of<00:00:57.950> money<00:00:58.040> on<00:00:58.370> robotic<00:00:58.940> arms<00:00:59.300> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
quite a bit of money on robotic arms and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.900 
quite a bit of money on robotic arms and
we've<00:01:00.440> studied<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.950> a<00:01:01.010> long<00:01:01.309> time<00:01:01.340> over<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
we've studied that a long time over the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.369 
we've studied that a long time over the
years<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.300> know<00:01:02.390> wouldn't<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.690> robot<00:01:03.050> come

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
years you know wouldn't a robot come

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.740 
years you know wouldn't a robot come
down<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.590> 12-inch<00:01:04.159> well<00:01:04.760> think<00:01:04.940> about<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.180> do

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
down a 12-inch well think about it do

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.120 
down a 12-inch well think about it do
you<00:01:05.810> think<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.200> get<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> robotic<00:01:06.800> arm<00:01:06.920> to

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you think you can get a robotic arm to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.750 
you think you can get a robotic arm to
come<00:01:07.340> down<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.700> 12<00:01:08.000> inch<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:08.690> go<00:01:08.869> over

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
come down that 12 inch and then go over

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.030 
come down that 12 inch and then go over
60<00:01:10.760> feet<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.810> answer<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.140> no<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:12.710> not<00:01:12.860> within

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
60 feet the answer is no it's not within

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.740 
60 feet the answer is no it's not within
the<00:01:13.159> limits<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.640> our<00:01:13.759> current<00:01:14.000> technology<00:01:14.210> to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
the limits of our current technology to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.420 
the limits of our current technology to
be<00:01:14.840> able<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.229> do<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:15.530> kind<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.830> thing<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.340> you

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
be able to do that kind of thing and you

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.760 
be able to do that kind of thing and you
know<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:16.700> thing<00:01:16.970> can<00:01:17.570> come<00:01:17.960> down<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.320> then

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
know this thing can come down and then

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.499 
know this thing can come down and then
go<00:01:18.890> over<00:01:18.920> 60<00:01:19.490> B<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.000> whole<00:01:20.119> purpose<00:01:20.270> of

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
go over 60 B so the whole purpose of

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.120 
go over 60 B so the whole purpose of
this<00:01:20.570> thing<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.110> push<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.470> slated<00:01:21.860> for<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
this thing is to push the slated for the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.560 
this thing is to push the slated for the
place<00:01:22.340> where<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.610> getting<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.000> that's<00:01:23.300> exactly

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
place where is getting so that's exactly

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.080 
place where is getting so that's exactly
right<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.170> problem<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.430> know<00:01:25.880> rather

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
right the problem is you know rather

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.639 
right the problem is you know rather
than<00:01:26.180> put<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> person<00:01:26.810> down<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.140> there<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:27.470> is

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
than put a person down in there which is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.940 
than put a person down in there which is
what<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.160> EPA<00:01:28.820> suggestion<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:29.950> we've

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
what the EPA suggestion was we've

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.480 
what the EPA suggestion was we've
developed<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.580> robot<00:01:32.679> so<00:01:33.679> who<00:01:33.860> developed<00:01:34.280> over

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
developed a robot so who developed over

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.380 
developed a robot so who developed over
this<00:01:34.700> little<00:01:34.970> robot<00:01:35.300> for<00:01:35.570> us<00:01:35.690> well<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.210> went

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
this little robot for us well we we went

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.960 
this little robot for us well we we went
out<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.080> did<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> worldwide<00:01:39.920> search<00:01:40.220> for

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
out and did a worldwide search for

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.389 
out and did a worldwide search for
people<00:01:41.119> who<00:01:41.270> clean<00:01:41.600> tanks<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.830> hazardous

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
people who clean tanks in hazardous

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
people who clean tanks in hazardous
environments

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it's now pushing more than its own

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.350 
it's now pushing more than its own
weight<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.130> impressive<00:01:53.640> very

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 

I<00:01:58.979> mean<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.670> think<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> could<00:02:00.150> push<00:02:00.479> them

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
I mean we think that I could push them

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
I mean we think that I could push them
and<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.470> lucky<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.280> turn<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and if I'm lucky he will not turn on the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
and if I'm lucky he will not turn on the
sprays<00:02:03.000> why<00:02:03.210> his<00:02:03.390> face<00:02:03.750> death<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.200> usually

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
sprays why his face death I usually

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.440 
sprays why his face death I usually
stand<00:02:05.130> over<00:02:05.369> by<00:02:05.400> Ken<00:02:05.580> because<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.150> work<00:02:06.270> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
stand over by Ken because they work for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:22.840 
stand over by Ken because they work for
him<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.049> don't<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.649> sprayed

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.790 

by<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.720> way<00:02:23.870> what<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.260> heard<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
by the way what you just heard the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.910 
by the way what you just heard the
communication<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:26.060> kind<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.920> what

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
communication it's kind of like what

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.530 
communication it's kind of like what
users<00:02:28.280> giving<00:02:28.550> him<00:02:28.640> an<00:02:28.790> instruction<00:02:29.240> they're

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
users giving him an instruction they're

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.480 
users giving him an instruction they're
repeating<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> instruction<00:02:30.680> back<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.340> then

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
repeating the instruction back and then

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.580 
repeating the instruction back and then
he's<00:02:31.520> confirming<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.660> they<00:02:32.930> got<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.380> right

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
he's confirming that they got it right

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.950 
he's confirming that they got it right
that's<00:02:34.580> called<00:02:34.790> freeway<00:02:35.150> communications

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
that's called freeway communications

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.130 
that's called freeway communications
very<00:02:36.350> very<00:02:36.530> important

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.250 

so<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.920> only<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.400> push<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.940> over<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:43.170> if

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
so not only can it push it over but if

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
so not only can it push it over but if
you<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.590> wanted<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.069> get<00:02:44.190> your<00:02:44.580> garage

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
you really wanted to get your garage

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.570 
you really wanted to get your garage
floor<00:02:45.600> clean<00:02:45.959> right<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> hose<00:02:47.310> out

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
floor clean right you get the hose out

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000 
floor clean right you get the hose out
and<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.030> had<00:02:48.060> hose<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.140> win<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and you had hose it off as you win and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.580 
and you had hose it off as you win and
so<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.370> designed<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.990> high<00:02:52.350> pressure

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
so it's designed to have a high pressure

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.280 
so it's designed to have a high pressure
spray<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.420> behind<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.140> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
spray and what you can see behind it is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.720 
spray and what you can see behind it is
the<00:02:56.010> paint<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.360> original<00:02:57.810> steel<00:02:58.110> floor

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the paint on the original steel floor

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.660 
the paint on the original steel floor
huh<00:03:00.290> see<00:03:01.290> how<00:03:01.440> clean<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.770> is<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.340> he's<00:03:02.459> going

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
huh see how clean that is if he's going

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.670 
huh see how clean that is if he's going
along<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:03.990> clean<00:03:04.290> they've<00:03:04.470> actually

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
along it's so clean they've actually

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
along it's so clean they've actually
scraped<00:03:05.160> some<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.610> paid<00:03:05.790> off<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.150> now

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
scraped some of the paid off and now

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.949 
scraped some of the paid off and now
we're<00:03:06.480> down<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> steal<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.170> some<00:03:07.380> places<00:03:08.959> our

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
we're down to steal in some places our

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.290 
we're down to steal in some places our
goal<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> high-quality<00:03:11.489> clean<00:03:12.120> up

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
goal is to do a high-quality clean up

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.050 
goal is to do a high-quality clean up
you<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.020> do<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.590> safely<00:03:13.980> nobody<00:03:14.880> gets

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you know to do it safely nobody gets

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.080 
you know to do it safely nobody gets
hurt<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.570> do<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> high<00:03:16.530> quality<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.820> clean

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
hurt and do a high quality on that clean

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.449 
hurt and do a high quality on that clean
up<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.959> make<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.350> device<00:03:19.650> does<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.430> a

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
up and make a device does it have a

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.440 
up and make a device does it have a
camera<00:03:20.730> work

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
camera work

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.199 
camera work
it's<00:03:22.230> good<00:03:22.500> right<00:03:22.950> now<00:03:23.580> we're<00:03:23.760> not<00:03:23.849> certainly

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it's good right now we're not certainly

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.430 
it's good right now we're not certainly
planning<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.750> putting<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.020> camera<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.410> board

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
planning on putting a camera on board

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.110 
planning on putting a camera on board
here's<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.250> reason<00:03:26.750> cameras<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:28.739> fail<00:03:29.120> okay

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
here's the reason cameras can fail okay

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.970 
here's the reason cameras can fail okay
this<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.629> actually<00:03:31.019> not<00:03:31.230> an<00:03:31.470> easy<00:03:31.590> thing<00:03:31.739> to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
this is actually not an easy thing to

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.240 
this is actually not an easy thing to
get<00:03:32.099> back<00:03:32.250> out<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.610> tank<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.220> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
get back out of the tank is it a is it a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.940 
get back out of the tank is it a is it a
sacrifice<00:03:35.910> basically<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.410> sacrifice

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
sacrifice basically this is a sacrifice

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.309 
sacrifice basically this is a sacrifice
mission<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.610> if<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.330> look<00:03:39.510> up<00:03:39.660> here<00:03:39.690> you'll

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
mission but if you look up here you'll

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.350 
mission but if you look up here you'll
see<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:41.040> are<00:03:41.220> three<00:03:41.250> different<00:03:41.819> cameras

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
see there are three different cameras

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.780 
see there are three different cameras
watching<00:03:42.540> us<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.410> speak<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:44.580> find

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
watching us as we speak and so we find

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
watching us as we speak and so we find
other<00:03:44.970> holes<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.840> stick<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.140> canvas<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.680> those

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
other holes to stick you canvas on those

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.320 
other holes to stick you canvas on those
and<00:03:47.340> then<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.480> we<00:03:48.599> do<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.019> we<00:03:49.790> do<00:03:50.790> every<00:03:51.060> watch

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
and then what we do is we do every watch

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.850 
and then what we do is we do every watch
everything<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.870> manage<00:03:52.230> everything<00:03:52.500> from

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
everything you manage everything from

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.680 
everything you manage everything from
those<00:03:53.040> cameras<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.760> bay<00:03:53.910> fail<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.569> can

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
those cameras in the bay fail we can

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.360 
those cameras in the bay fail we can
pull<00:03:54.840> them<00:03:54.989> out<00:03:55.170> because<00:03:55.470> they've<00:03:56.069> never<00:03:56.099> been

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
pull them out because they've never been

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.030 
pull them out because they've never been
in<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.730> way<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.569> thing<00:03:57.870> goes<00:03:58.140> down<00:03:58.470> into<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
in the way this thing goes down into the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.920 
in the way this thing goes down into the
way<00:03:59.130> when<00:03:59.790> you're<00:03:59.970> done<00:04:00.209> no<00:04:00.510> matter<00:04:00.630> what<00:04:00.900> you

way when you're done no matter what you

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
way when you're done no matter what you
try<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.200> do<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.920> going<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.250> contaminated

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
try to do it's going to be contaminated

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.089 
try to do it's going to be contaminated
it's<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.079> waste<00:04:04.319> it's<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:04.890> part<00:04:05.040> of

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
it's going to be waste it's just part of

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.740 
it's going to be waste it's just part of
the<00:04:05.160> waist<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.849> part<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> way<00:04:06.239> so

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the waist it's just part of the way so

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.360 
the waist it's just part of the way so
it's<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.019> it's<00:04:07.290> one<00:04:07.470> per<00:04:07.650> tank<00:04:07.829> basically

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
it's a it's one per tank basically

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.120 
it's a it's one per tank basically
basically<00:04:08.730> one<00:04:09.150> pretend<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.829> device

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
basically one pretend it's this device

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.339 
basically one pretend it's this device
this<00:04:11.489> one<00:04:11.700> you're<00:04:11.880> looking<00:04:11.910> at<00:04:12.269> this<00:04:13.019> long

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
this one you're looking at this long

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.400 
this one you're looking at this long
term<00:04:13.620> life<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.310> be<00:04:14.459> at<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.730> bottom<00:04:15.109> tank<00:04:16.109> c

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
term life is to be at the bottom tank c

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.069 
term life is to be at the bottom tank c
1<00:04:16.560> 09<00:04:16.829> forever<00:04:17.870> eventually<00:04:18.870> what<00:04:19.079> will<00:04:19.109> happen

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
1 09 forever eventually what will happen

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.629 
1 09 forever eventually what will happen
so<00:04:22.079> yeah<00:04:22.650> what<00:04:22.830> do<00:04:22.889> you<00:04:22.919> do<00:04:23.010> as<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> waste<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
so yeah what do you do as a waste on the

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.150 
so yeah what do you do as a waste on the
wall

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.580 

crowd<00:04:28.730> control<00:04:28.910> baby

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.260 

he<00:04:32.040> could<00:04:32.190> break<00:04:32.370> up<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.550> frat<00:04:32.760> party<00:04:32.790> with<00:04:33.150> that

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
he could break up a frat party with that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
he could break up a frat party with that
thing<00:04:33.450> actually<00:04:33.870> not<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> highest

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
thing actually not going to the highest

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.710 
thing actually not going to the highest
pressure<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.460> possible

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.080 

I<00:04:40.800> understand

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.520 

we've<00:04:46.090> had<00:04:46.270> devices<00:04:46.900> from<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.170> additive

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
we've had devices from the additive

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.900 
we've had devices from the additive
identity<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:49.150> goes<00:04:49.360> up<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.620> 32,000<00:04:50.620> psi<00:04:51.100> with

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
identity that goes up to 32,000 psi with

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.510 
identity that goes up to 32,000 psi with
the<00:04:52.000> water<00:04:52.210> pressure<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:53.410> guys<00:04:53.620> were<00:04:54.220> at<00:04:54.370> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
the water pressure you guys were at the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.980 
the water pressure you guys were at the
presentation<00:04:55.030> where<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.360> talked<00:04:55.600> about<00:04:55.690> that

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
presentation where I talked about that

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.730 
presentation where I talked about that
last<00:04:56.020> year<00:04:57.090> at<00:04:58.090> those<00:04:58.450> kind<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.810> pressures<00:04:59.170> if

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
last year at those kind of pressures if

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.410 
last year at those kind of pressures if
you<00:04:59.890> put<00:05:00.100> just<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.400> little<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.060> sand<00:05:01.270> in

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
you put just a little bit of sand in

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.240 
you put just a little bit of sand in
there<00:05:01.570> it'll<00:05:01.840> cut<00:05:02.110> right<00:05:02.320> through<00:05:02.350> steel<00:05:02.860> very

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
there it'll cut right through steel very

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.160 
there it'll cut right through steel very
nicely<00:05:03.460> in<00:05:03.760> fact<00:05:03.970> it's<00:05:04.240> used<00:05:04.420> commercially<00:05:05.050> as

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
nicely in fact it's used commercially as

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.740 
nicely in fact it's used commercially as
a<00:05:05.200> steel<00:05:05.530> cutting<00:05:05.800> device<00:05:06.270> we<00:05:07.270> were<00:05:07.510> careful

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
a steel cutting device we were careful

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.020 
a steel cutting device we were careful
to<00:05:07.900> use<00:05:07.990> very<00:05:08.260> clean<00:05:08.560> water<00:05:08.800> here<00:05:09.220> because

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
to use very clean water here because

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.360 
to use very clean water here because
clean<00:05:10.810> water<00:05:11.020> doesn't<00:05:11.260> tend<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.710> cut<00:05:11.890> steel<00:05:12.130> as

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
clean water doesn't tend to cut steel as

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.040 
clean water doesn't tend to cut steel as
well<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:13.060> course<00:05:13.270> our<00:05:13.450> idea<00:05:13.720> is<00:05:13.780> not<00:05:13.990> to

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
well and of course our idea is not to

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.530 
well and of course our idea is not to
make<00:05:14.350> more<00:05:15.040> holes<00:05:15.280> in<00:05:15.490> this<00:05:15.610> field<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.390> so

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
make more holes in this field and so

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.090 
make more holes in this field and so
they<00:05:16.690> practice<00:05:17.110> we've<00:05:17.290> actually<00:05:17.470> dropped<00:05:17.920> our

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
they practice we've actually dropped our

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.010 
they practice we've actually dropped our
water<00:05:18.310> pressure<00:05:18.580> down<00:05:18.850> here<00:05:19.150> that's<00:05:19.750> why

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
water pressure down here that's why

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260 
water pressure down here that's why
BattleBots<00:05:21.010> don't<00:05:21.340> got<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.520> chance<00:05:21.790> because<00:05:22.030> we

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
BattleBots don't got a chance because we

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.540 
BattleBots don't got a chance because we
can<00:05:22.420> stand<00:05:22.660> off<00:05:22.900> 30<00:05:23.260> feet<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.680> actually<00:05:24.370> cut

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
can stand off 30 feet and actually cut

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.890 
can stand off 30 feet and actually cut
them<00:05:24.670> in<00:05:24.730> half<00:05:26.520> Wow<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:27.910> yeah<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.570> wouldn't

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
them in half Wow so yeah you wouldn't

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.720 
them in half Wow so yeah you wouldn't
you<00:05:29.440> don't<00:05:29.590> want<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.770> take<00:05:29.920> up<00:05:29.950> getting<00:05:30.460> water

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
you don't want to take up getting water

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.460 
you don't want to take up getting water
it's<00:05:31.090> getting<00:05:31.360> water<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.660> control<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.320> power

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
it's getting water in control and power

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.710 
it's getting water in control and power
all<00:05:32.740> down<00:05:32.890> this<00:05:33.040> weed<00:05:33.280> yes<00:05:33.820> hydraulic<00:05:34.480> and

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
all down this weed yes hydraulic and

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.110 
all down this weed yes hydraulic and
this<00:05:35.080> is<00:05:35.200> all<00:05:35.350> hydraulically<00:05:36.040> driven<00:05:36.130> okay

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
this is all hydraulically driven okay

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.580 
this is all hydraulically driven okay
now<00:05:37.270> remember<00:05:37.390> the<00:05:37.720> environment<00:05:38.170> highly

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
now remember the environment highly

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.580 
now remember the environment highly
radioactive<00:05:38.850> okay<00:05:39.850> lethal<00:05:40.630> doses<00:05:41.020> in<00:05:41.170> minutes

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
radioactive okay lethal doses in minutes

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.130 
radioactive okay lethal doses in minutes
if<00:05:41.770> it<00:05:41.890> was<00:05:42.070> a<00:05:42.100> person<00:05:42.490> down<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.870> FBI

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
if it was a person down in it so the FBI

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.020 
if it was a person down in it so the FBI
materials<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:44.920> can<00:05:45.040> take<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.430> kind<00:05:45.970> of

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
materials that can take that kind of

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.150 
materials that can take that kind of
high<00:05:46.150> radiation<00:05:46.300> highly<00:05:46.780> caustic<00:05:47.410> remember

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
high radiation highly caustic remember

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.830 
high radiation highly caustic remember
it<00:05:48.310> can<00:05:48.430> just<00:05:48.670> eat<00:05:48.850> things<00:05:49.120> up<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:49.540> you<00:05:49.630> got<00:05:49.750> to

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
it can just eat things up so you got to

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.150 
it can just eat things up so you got to
make<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.020> out<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.200> material<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.590> can<00:05:50.770> survive

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
make it out of material that can survive

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.400 
make it out of material that can survive
in<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.910> caustic<00:05:52.390> environment<00:05:52.840> what<00:05:52.960> nice<00:05:53.140> try

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
in the caustic environment what nice try

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.260 
in the caustic environment what nice try
but<00:05:53.770> here's<00:05:53.980> just<00:05:54.040> joy<00:05:54.520> just<00:05:54.820> gets<00:05:55.000> even

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
but here's just joy just gets even

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.090 
but here's just joy just gets even
better<00:05:55.390> when<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:56.140> put<00:05:56.290> radiation<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.920> water

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
better when you put radiation and water

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.260 
better when you put radiation and water
together<00:05:57.310> what<00:05:57.700> do<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:57.820> get<00:05:57.970> you<00:05:58.150> get

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
together what do you get you get

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.120 
together what do you get you get
radiolysis<00:05:58.840> which<00:05:59.230> means<00:05:59.470> hydrogen<00:06:00.010> and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
radiolysis which means hydrogen and

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.270 
radiolysis which means hydrogen and
oxygen<00:06:00.280> in<00:06:01.090> water<00:06:01.150> split<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.320> become<00:06:02.500> gas<00:06:03.010> so

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
oxygen in water split and become gas so

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.940 
oxygen in water split and become gas so
it's<00:06:03.490> so<00:06:04.390> it's<00:06:04.420> flammable<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.410> explore<00:06:05.770> for

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
it's so it's flammable and explore for

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.220 
it's so it's flammable and explore for
the<00:06:05.980> drill<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.240> don't<00:06:07.600> want<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:07.930> send<00:06:08.080> up<00:06:08.170> a

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
the drill so you don't want to send up a

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.410 
the drill so you don't want to send up a
lot<00:06:08.380> electrons<00:06:08.860> down<00:06:09.250> into<00:06:09.700> that<00:06:09.910> potential

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
lot electrons down into that potential

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.820 
lot electrons down into that potential
environment<00:06:10.870> what<00:06:11.110> do<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.290> want<00:06:11.470> to<00:06:11.560> send<00:06:11.710> it

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
environment what do you want to send it

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.550 
environment what do you want to send it
a<00:06:11.920> lot<00:06:12.130> of<00:06:12.280> water<00:06:12.630> so<00:06:13.630> try<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.020> reduce<00:06:14.350> the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
a lot of water so try to reduce the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.890 
a lot of water so try to reduce the
amount<00:06:14.740> of<00:06:14.830> waste<00:06:14.890> there<00:06:15.400> you<00:06:15.670> go<00:06:15.850> so<00:06:16.570> you<00:06:16.630> want

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
amount of waste there you go so you want

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.180 
amount of waste there you go so you want
to<00:06:16.960> keep<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.260> water<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.650> minimum<00:06:18.040> but

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
to keep the water to a minimum but

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.710 
to keep the water to a minimum but
that's<00:06:18.430> okay<00:06:18.730> we<00:06:18.910> can<00:06:18.940> we<00:06:19.390> have<00:06:19.510> ways<00:06:19.690> to

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
that's okay we can we have ways to

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.550 
that's okay we can we have ways to
manage<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.260> water<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:22.020> hydraulics<00:06:23.020> so<00:06:23.500> you

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
manage the water you hydraulics so you

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.470 
manage the water you hydraulics so you
can<00:06:23.950> get<00:06:24.040> a<00:06:24.100> lot<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.310> hydraulic<00:06:24.850> power<00:06:25.060> as<00:06:25.300> you

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
can get a lot of hydraulic power as you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.170 
can get a lot of hydraulic power as you
can<00:06:25.660> see<00:06:25.900> down<00:06:26.890> down<00:06:27.340> a<00:06:27.370> very<00:06:27.610> small<00:06:27.820> hydraulic

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
can see down down a very small hydraulic

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.000 
can see down down a very small hydraulic
line<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:29.350> can<00:06:29.470> do<00:06:29.560> a<00:06:29.590> lot<00:06:29.710> of<00:06:29.770> power

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
line you can do a lot of power

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.130 
line you can do a lot of power
transmission<00:06:30.610> so<00:06:30.760> all<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.150> power<00:06:31.450> is<00:06:31.930> up

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
transmission so all the power is up

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.540 
transmission so all the power is up
above<00:06:32.590> and<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.950> goes<00:06:33.100> into<00:06:33.310> making

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
above and it goes into making

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.270 
above and it goes into making
high-pressure<00:06:34.450> hydraulic<00:06:34.870> fluid<00:06:35.380> and<00:06:35.980> that's

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
high-pressure hydraulic fluid and that's

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.490 
high-pressure hydraulic fluid and that's
why<00:06:36.520> you<00:06:36.580> can<00:06:36.820> go<00:06:36.940> down<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.120> 12<00:06:37.480> inch<00:06:37.600> riser<00:06:37.870> have

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
why you can go down a 12 inch riser have

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.560 
why you can go down a 12 inch riser have
a<00:06:38.530> whole<00:06:38.830> bunch<00:06:39.100> of<00:06:39.220> cables<00:06:39.520> hydraulic<00:06:40.210> cables

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
a whole bunch of cables hydraulic cables

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.170 
a whole bunch of cables hydraulic cables
no<00:06:41.200> switches<00:06:41.770> in<00:06:41.920> here<00:06:42.100> no<00:06:42.520> electrons<00:06:43.000> in<00:06:43.150> here

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
no switches in here no electrons in here

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.370 
no switches in here no electrons in here
that's<00:06:43.450> one<00:06:43.570> of<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.720> other<00:06:43.840> reasons<00:06:43.960> we<00:06:44.230> don't

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
that's one of the other reasons we don't

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.260 
that's one of the other reasons we don't
want<00:06:44.500> to<00:06:44.560> put<00:06:44.650> a<00:06:44.680> camera<00:06:44.890> on<00:06:45.040> it<00:06:45.160> keep<00:06:46.120> the

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
want to put a camera on it keep the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.650 
want to put a camera on it keep the
cameras<00:06:46.630> up<00:06:46.750> above<00:06:47.610> so<00:06:48.610> it's<00:06:48.760> all<00:06:48.940> hydraulics

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
cameras up above so it's all hydraulics

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.590 
cameras up above so it's all hydraulics
like<00:06:49.810> a<00:06:49.840> 68<00:06:50.260> people<00:06:50.440> that's<00:06:51.010> right<00:06:51.130> it's<00:06:51.400> all

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
like a 68 people that's right it's all

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.670 
like a 68 people that's right it's all
hydraulics<00:06:52.600> this<00:06:52.750> is<00:06:52.900> all<00:06:53.020> old<00:06:53.200> t-bird<00:06:53.500> said

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
hydraulics this is all old t-bird said

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.380 
hydraulics this is all old t-bird said
hydraulic<00:06:53.920> windows<00:06:54.340> and<00:06:54.520> yes<00:06:54.670> that's<00:06:55.240> right

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
hydraulic windows and yes that's right

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.320
