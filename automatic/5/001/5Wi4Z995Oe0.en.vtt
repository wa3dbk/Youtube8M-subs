00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.860
 the dinosaurs still populated Daren's creation of our earth 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.139
 Raw material used today millions of years later around the world 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.429
 becomes 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.929
 Natural gas from the depths of the earth to our home 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.989
 Such a bluish end of flames may have been seen before 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 at the gas stove in your kitchen for example 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the gas boiler which ensures that hot water flows from the faucet 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 The new home gets nice and warm 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.460
 Pölten 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.839
 but here is so bluish blue it is space 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.209
 if it does not burn it is invisible you can only judge it then but only 

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:48.800
 because it's extra punishable with a stinking offense 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.889
 so you smell it immediately is accidentally exit for natural gas 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.629
 has a special feature it burns very easily and that is exactly what it burns 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.160
 Advantage because it can be easily used for many things 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 as I said, to cook and heat 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.620
 but also in many factories for the production of glass or porcelain 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.970
 as a fuel to refuel similar to gasoline 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.409
 and the big advantage of natural gas 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.420
 it is more environmentally friendly than many other fuels 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.710
 it contains much less air pollution stop ball for example 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.930
 Cables are made from the gasoline and diesel 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.409
 and because natural gas has these properties 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.000
 easily combustible and less harmful to the environment 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.160
 it is very much in demand all over the world 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.810
 How does the natural gas come to your home? 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.950
 first Germany and fly to the North Sea in the North Sea there is namely 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.450
 large quantities of natural gas, better said, the seabed under the North Sea 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.340
 and how did it get there? 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.950
 this is a process that began about 600 million years ago 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.329
 Natural gas is even if that sounds weird 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.950
 frustrated that I created their and albums 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.190
 because they die, they sink on the seabed 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.180
 above that they had sand and boulders 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.470
 Over time, more and more layers of dead animals and plants and sand are 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.169
 and rubble emerged 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.430
 the pressure on the plants and animals first 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.639
 became bigger and bigger 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.619
 and the temperature is getting warmer and so is the passage of time from the primitive times 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.529
 every creature he had thrown glass 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.459
 we've put it here it pertains globules in fact it's like 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.799
 already said invisible 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.349
 The natural gas stored in courses rock similar to a swarm usually 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.099
 many kilometers deep under the seabed 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.130
 but how do you now get to the gas there laps deep in the seabed pumps 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.999
 for example, with huge platform platforms with smaller ones in the seabed 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.559
 are anchored 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.579
 a drill 40 kilometers backwards into the seabed 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.149
 meets with the natural gas up to the rock layer 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.000
 after the hole was secured with Porsche then 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.079
 a small explosion is ignited 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.019
 This results in the lower part of the goal bar many holes through the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.039
 Gas can penetrate now 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.459
 and because the gas is under pressure it goes up 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.739
 their 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.869
 the gas pressure in the rock is over 300 bar 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.529
 is the unit of measure for eating troops 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.439
 For comparison, the pressure in a car tire is two to three lanes 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.829
 Having arrived at the top, the gas is then piped up huge pipelines 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:32.940
 at 30 kilometers per hour, about as fast as a cyclist 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 Natural gas is making its way towards the mainland 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.139
 After about three days, natural gas will arrive in Germany 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.899
 on his journey through the pipelines loses the gas pressure 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.939
 There are about every 200 kilometers so-called compressor station 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.019
 here the whole thing is thrown through a turbine 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 and so the beads are met again poets 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.479
 it has the necessary pressure again 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.899
 usually you can not see the pipelines because they are under the 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:07.179
 Earth but we have drawn the last year looks like one 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.179
 Road network with highways. Highways and residential streets 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.359
 on the highways a1 and thick pipes Ströhen huge amounts of gas over a wide area 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.209
 stretch 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.030
 on the highways so the pipes a little less thick always struggles 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.190
 still pretty large amounts to securitize and companies how much 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.110
 Buy natural gas 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.819
 and in the residential streets as born in India 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.490
 Strain small amounts of gas into the houses 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.020
 the good thing about the gas pipeline network compared to the road network 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.830
 hereby the gas goes unnoticed 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 transported without noise and stench 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.940
 to monitor the transport and distribution work smoothly 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.189
 Gas supply companies, for example, here in the 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.189
 Control room of gas supply Southern Germany in Stuttgart 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.169
 Not only kart gas from the North Sea is being channeled into the German network 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.610
 but also from Russia more precisely from Siberia 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.960
 from up here you can only see the snow, which is almost all year round 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.930
 but at some kilometers deep in the earth, there are the biggest ones he has 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.050
 Gas deposits in the world because it was millions of years ago 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.160
 One more given the same thing happened in the North Sea 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.779
 Here, too, natural gas is being followed up with the help of Borkum and the Board of Management 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.370
 and then migrate to pipelines 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.410
 some of which are more than 5000 kilometers long in the direction of Europe, the natural gas 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.089
 Siberia 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.869
 a brother from the North Sea partly not infinite but there are now 

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.530
 already bio natural gas 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.840
 this is gained from such energy plants 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.770
 and they keep growing 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.740
 Small shredded plants and also manure become airtight in huge silos 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.770
 closed and fermented 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.780
 This produces biogas and that does not take millions of years but only 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.250
 please treat this gas a few days later Detlef says 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.719
 to 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.799
 and that gives biogas exactly the same properties as natural gas 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:10.489
 Sounds very light and contains hardly any polluting air 

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:13.969
 Guests are a good binder and are returned to the fields 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.360
 Rottmann for the cultivation of the plants no other plans middle 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.880
 the bio natural gas is destroyed with the natural gas from the earth in a line and 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.119
 really transported home like this 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.150
 the doctors just start 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.050
 and the gas burns on your heart no matter 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.330
 whether it's from the North Sea 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.360
 comes from Siberia or the biogas plant
