00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.040 
school can produce such good teams I
have<00:05:17.700> a<00:05:17.760> happy<00:05:18.180> for<00:05:18.450> getting<00:05:18.480> into<00:05:18.900> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
have a happy for getting into the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.150 
have a happy for getting into the
community<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.530> working<00:05:19.830> with<00:05:19.950> younger

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
community and working with younger

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.980 
community and working with younger
players<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.820> we<00:05:20.940> develop<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.510> skills<00:05:21.840> that

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
players that we develop the skills that

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.380 
players that we develop the skills that
they<00:05:22.260> need<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:23.310> competitive<00:05:23.880> at<00:05:24.000> an<00:05:24.120> older

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
they need to be competitive at an older

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.230 
they need to be competitive at an older
age<00:05:24.420> and<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.890> I<00:05:25.920> think<00:05:26.070> we're<00:05:26.370> at<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.490> very<00:05:26.940> very

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
age and so I think we're at a very very

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.890 
age and so I think we're at a very very
good<00:05:28.110> place<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:29.070> US<00:05:29.700> soccer<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.840> don't

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
good place in US soccer and I don't

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.390 
good place in US soccer and I don't
think<00:05:31.140> we<00:05:31.410> need<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.590> keep<00:05:31.800> looking<00:05:31.860> at<00:05:32.250> where

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
think we need to keep looking at where

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.800 
think we need to keep looking at where
the<00:05:32.520> national<00:05:32.880> team<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.300> we<00:05:33.480> need<00:05:33.780> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
the national team is that we need to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.060 
the national team is that we need to
judge<00:05:34.140> it<00:05:34.290> on<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.410> young<00:05:34.680> players<00:05:34.950> coming

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
judge it on the young players coming

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.970 
judge it on the young players coming
true<00:05:35.600> that<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.870> strength<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.380> MLS<00:05:37.740> the
