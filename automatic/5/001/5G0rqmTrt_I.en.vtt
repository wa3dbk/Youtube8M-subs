00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 come on guys for another review 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.020
 biochemistry and here I go 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.779
 explain to you what is the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.059
 catabolism and anabolism and show 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.139
 relationship between these two terms 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.250
 Image 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 good catabolism means breakdown of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.760
 molecules into smaller products for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.330
 generation of energy or other products 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 functional and anabolism 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.949
 construction of macromolecules then note 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990
 the following what we have here in the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 Catholicism we have initially 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.559
 relatively large products and is the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 starch and triglycerides. 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 in Catholicism of these products we 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 we will break these macromolecules into 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 smaller molecules for two occasions 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 to generate the energy for other reactions 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 of our organism and also generate a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 extremely important product called 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.420
 of Setil with it and also the products of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.039
 cycle of strikes and what is important to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.340
 people understand that the catabolism it is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.589
 always convergent, it always goes 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.049
 make a specific product 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.360
 so we are generating smaller products 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.290
 and the intention of catabolism is always 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 generate specific products for 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 develop the anabolism that is the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.159
 building other molecules right 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 so see on the cataric bolivia we 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 we withdraw energy from these molecules and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.110
 we generate a specific substrate that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.840
 energy generated catabolism gives us the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
 basis for building molecules 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 larger 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 there is a complete metabolic regulation 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.390
 for this is happening but via 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.729
 rule the idea is why we 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.500
 we call that catabolism it is 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.850
 convergence and anabolism it is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.880
 divergent it will generate us products 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.649
 with a basis of use of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 smaller products are building 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 molecules and catabolism is breaking 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 these molecules to provide the energy 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 for the construction of molecules 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.930
 important in our body 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.399
 this intercommunication of catabolism with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.629
 the anabolism we say is the 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.629
