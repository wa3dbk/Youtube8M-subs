 coffee alcohol rapid following today 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.080
 Tell me something about burger king 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 happened with very bad 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.970
 thing but before that I want to go again 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.619
 very briefly on the video of last 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 week went into dialogical giants of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 fox because someone wrote me down 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.689
 should more often such a lyric reading 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.880
 That's why I want you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.640
 of course ask which song lyrics should 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.660
 I put over and then as a lyric 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.100
 prosa I am so broken because 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.809
 I just slipped in here five times 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.829
 I'm on the camera every time 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 but slipped over is that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.140
 absolutely not important 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 today there are of course again what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 to win and the raffle of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.420
 Last week but first times the matter 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.640
 at burger king 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 I have a little unpleasant 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 had experience you can then me 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.340
 say if I have behaved correctly 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 if I did it wrong 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 It was like that but first buy coffee 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.869
 yes and willingly after an appearance 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 my driver drove home and we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.670
 I still had animal hunger and I know 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 usually fast food not good though 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 what should you do and that's why 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 we drove to a burger king and there 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 I ordered and I have mine 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 I thought that I had good performances 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.659
 I'm fine 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 the menu of chili cheese extra 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.750
 I have blablabla dingsbums lustenau 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.220
 back home I'm doing something extra 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 because that's the trick if you have one 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 extra to do a tuba then blows 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.240
 you always get fresh 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 I said with extra bacon because on the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.540
 card stand extra basin 50 cents more 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 699 plus 50 cents 47 and then ask me 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.240
 the fifth at the box office with majo or 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.100
 ketchup the fries and I'm short 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.479
 confused and then he asks again and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 I say but I'm wondering right now 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.530
 why the 799 is on the cash register then 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.450
 he says 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 well you have with extra basin 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 ordered because I say yes 699 plus 50 cents 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.239
 extra basin makes 749 then he has me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 So calculated almost twice bacon because 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.530
 he thought 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.030
 has bacon and extra bacon is there 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.739
 also the genitive usually no 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.709
 Basin need not be as normal as 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.440
 on the map as just simply blablabla 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.110
 just away content with extracts 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.080
 just like that he said yes then say 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.819
 Please do it differently next time 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.250
 and must his supervisor of 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.840
 call the cashier to open the box 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.910
 to change and roll your eyes 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.500
 then I apologized to him 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.410
 number very short so we get it right 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.269
 understand you have just the order 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 misunderstood and incorrectly entered 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.840
 and now tell me to go next 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.360
 order differently I have the same 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.519
 ordered was called there is the citizen with 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.280
 extra basin and you tell me I should 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.120
 the next time order differently and 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.010
 Then he says 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.440
 So first you are a driver 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.269
 touched and said come on we go and 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.980
 gone out to eat and then call me 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.510
 still players behind 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.700
 Unfortunately I did not hear me 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 me then my buddy outside 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.510
 and that's why I'm back 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.940
 retired canceled for a short time 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.680
 did you just call me a spinner and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.410
 he says yes and I have to be on 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.090
 Name tag looked and watched 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.130
 and I left and I was 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 angry and he was angry too and we 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.489
 everything was clean but me how is that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.019

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.910

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.230
 because this is the usual state or have 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.519
