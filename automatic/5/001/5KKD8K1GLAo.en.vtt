00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so if I was a little fun guy living on

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.380 
so if I was a little fun guy living on
that<00:00:04.380> strawberry<00:00:04.710> right<00:00:05.580> now<00:00:05.819> it'd<00:00:06.210> be

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
that strawberry right now it'd be

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.020 
that strawberry right now it'd be
carnage<00:00:06.870> yeah<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:08.040> fact<00:00:08.370> we've<00:00:08.550> done<00:00:08.760> some

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
carnage yeah in fact we've done some

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.940 
carnage yeah in fact we've done some
studies<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.570> bacterial<00:00:10.230> spores<00:00:10.500> which<00:00:10.830> are

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
studies with bacterial spores which are

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.620 
studies with bacterial spores which are
much<00:00:11.190> tough<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.550> even<00:00:11.820> fungal<00:00:12.210> spores<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
much tough that even fungal spores and

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390 
much tough that even fungal spores and
it<00:00:12.719> basically<00:00:12.929> blasts<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.799> pieces<00:00:13.980> I

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
it basically blasts them to pieces I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.160 
it basically blasts them to pieces I
could<00:00:15.179> film<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.599> all<00:00:15.750> day

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
could film this all day

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.230 
could film this all day
you're<00:00:16.440> right<00:00:16.619> three<00:00:16.920> stars<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.760> very<00:00:17.970> Star

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you're right three stars it's very Star

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
you're right three stars it's very Star
Wars<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.199> science<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.100> fun<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.460> well

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
Wars it's science and it's fun as well

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.779 
Wars it's science and it's fun as well
it's<00:00:20.820> brilliant

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.220 

we<00:00:25.240> did<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:25.570> experiment

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
we did this experiment

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.529 
we did this experiment
for<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.410> weekend<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:27.250> gone<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.580> got<00:00:27.789> left<00:00:28.090> as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
for the weekend it gone and got left as

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.630 
for the weekend it gone and got left as
these<00:00:28.810> things<00:00:29.020> do<00:00:29.349> came<00:00:29.740> back<00:00:29.949> on<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.250> Monday

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
these things do came back on the Monday

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400 
these things do came back on the Monday
and<00:00:30.910> we<00:00:31.449> were<00:00:31.539> sitting<00:00:31.900> there<00:00:31.930> looking<00:00:32.320> at

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
and we were sitting there looking at

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and we were sitting there looking at
these<00:00:32.500> strawberries<00:00:32.920> in<00:00:33.040> pristine<00:00:33.220> condition

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
these strawberries in pristine condition

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.220 
these strawberries in pristine condition
where<00:00:34.059> everything<00:00:34.420> else<00:00:34.570> around<00:00:34.870> them<00:00:35.079> that

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
where everything else around them that

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.770 
where everything else around them that
was<00:00:35.410> furry<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.040> disgusting<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:37.180> there<00:00:37.629> was<00:00:37.750> a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
was furry and disgusting and there was a

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.030 
was furry and disgusting and there was a
moment<00:00:38.140> when<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.290> was<00:00:38.320> running<00:00:38.650> up<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:38.920> down

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
moment when I was running up and down

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.790 
moment when I was running up and down
the<00:00:39.160> corridors<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.790> all<00:00:40.239> days<00:00:40.840> because

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
the corridors going all days because

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.320 
the corridors going all days because
this<00:00:41.890> was<00:00:42.070> like<00:00:42.220> an<00:00:42.339> extension<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> shelf

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
this was like an extension of the shelf

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.329 
this was like an extension of the shelf
life<00:00:43.540> for<00:00:43.690> four<00:00:43.870> days<00:00:44.050> which<00:00:44.350> for<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> food

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
life for four days which for the food

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.119 
life for four days which for the food
industry<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.910> big<00:00:46.330> issue<00:00:46.750> from<00:00:47.680> gear<00:00:47.860> really

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
industry is big issue from gear really

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.070 
industry is big issue from gear really
important<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.790> natural<00:00:49.180> world<00:00:49.330> we<00:00:49.960> are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
important in the natural world we are

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.750 
important in the natural world we are
eating<00:00:50.379> food<00:00:50.650> which<00:00:50.980> are<00:00:51.100> plants

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
eating food which are plants

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.610 
eating food which are plants
therefore<00:00:52.540> they<00:00:52.629> are<00:00:52.750> naturally<00:00:53.290> got<00:00:53.440> funky

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
therefore they are naturally got funky

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.200 
therefore they are naturally got funky
on<00:00:53.860> them<00:00:54.040> because<00:00:54.309> otherwise<00:00:54.550> we're<00:00:55.089> never

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
on them because otherwise we're never

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.090 
on them because otherwise we're never
going<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.449> get<00:00:55.570> rid<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.720> them<00:00:55.839> clearly<00:00:56.470> once<00:00:56.890> we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
going to get rid of them clearly once we

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.130 
going to get rid of them clearly once we
take<00:00:57.460> things<00:00:57.640> into<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.059> kitchen<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.960> race

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
take things into the kitchen it's a race

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.810 
take things into the kitchen it's a race
against<00:00:59.500> time<00:00:59.559> now<00:00:59.980> between<00:01:00.250> them<00:01:00.489> breaking

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
against time now between them breaking

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.150 
against time now between them breaking
it<00:01:01.059> down<00:01:01.210> naturally<00:01:01.539> and<00:01:01.989> ice<00:01:02.050> eating<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.500> so

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
it down naturally and ice eating it so

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.389 
it down naturally and ice eating it so
for<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.820> food<00:01:04.059> industry<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> big<00:01:04.809> issue<00:01:04.960> and

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
for the food industry is a big issue and

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.100 
for the food industry is a big issue and
as<00:01:06.399> most<00:01:06.640> people<00:01:06.940> know<00:01:06.970> if<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.390> get<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.780> pack

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
as most people know if you get a pack

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.870 
as most people know if you get a pack
with<00:01:08.320> one<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.009> that<00:01:09.280> goes<00:01:09.460> furry

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
with one in it that goes furry

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.730 
with one in it that goes furry
everything<00:01:10.600> else<00:01:10.780> goes<00:01:11.050> with<00:01:11.080> it

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
everything else goes with it

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.310 
everything else goes with it
we<00:01:12.310> were<00:01:12.430> using<00:01:12.670> plasmas<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.660> had<00:01:13.899> already

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
we were using plasmas that had already

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.130 
we were using plasmas that had already
been<00:01:14.680> developed<00:01:14.800> for<00:01:15.399> use<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:15.960> cleaning<00:01:16.960> in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
been developed for use in cleaning in

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.990 
been developed for use in cleaning in
medical<00:01:17.530> applications<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.520> idea<00:01:18.850> was

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
medical applications and the idea was

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.230 
medical applications and the idea was
could<00:01:19.300> we<00:01:19.330> use<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.929> clean<00:01:20.429> food<00:01:21.429> surfaces

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
could we use this to clean food surfaces

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.620 
could we use this to clean food surfaces
so<00:01:22.869> plasma<00:01:23.440> for<00:01:23.740> state<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.280> matter<00:01:24.940> solid

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
so plasma for state of matter solid

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.950 
so plasma for state of matter solid
liquid<00:01:25.780> gas<00:01:26.289> plasma<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.759> ionized<00:01:28.300> gases

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
liquid gas plasma so ionized gases

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.620 
liquid gas plasma so ionized gases
effectively<00:01:29.880> gases<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.030> electricity<00:01:31.450> come

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
effectively gases and electricity come

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.139 
effectively gases and electricity come
together<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.110> pen<00:01:32.560> structure<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.369> what

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
together in that pen structure and what

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.089 
together in that pen structure and what
you<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.869> gas<00:01:35.020> cylinders<00:01:35.500> which<00:01:35.920> are

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
you have is the gas cylinders which are

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.010 
you have is the gas cylinders which are
feeding<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.640> some<00:01:36.940> oxygen<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.539> some<00:01:37.810> helium

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
feeding in some oxygen and some helium

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.960 
feeding in some oxygen and some helium
and<00:01:38.349> all<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.649> kids<00:01:38.860> at<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.069> market<00:01:39.490> there<00:01:39.700> is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
and all the kids at the market there is

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.389 
and all the kids at the market there is
controlling<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.259> electrical<00:01:41.950> pulses<00:01:42.369> that

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
controlling the electrical pulses that

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.880 
controlling the electrical pulses that
are<00:01:42.610> going<00:01:42.759> through<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.450> trick<00:01:44.319> here<00:01:44.770> is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
are going through it the trick here is

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.279 
are going through it the trick here is
our<00:01:45.610> colleagues<00:01:46.149> l'Opera<00:01:46.660> who<00:01:46.869> come<00:01:47.140> up<00:01:47.259> with

our colleagues l'Opera who come up with

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.440 
our colleagues l'Opera who come up with
a<00:01:47.470> way<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.709> making<00:01:48.310> these<00:01:48.640> plasmas<00:01:49.119> at<00:01:49.239> low

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
a way of making these plasmas at low

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.350 
a way of making these plasmas at low
temperature<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.410> atmospheric<00:01:51.039> gases<00:01:51.459> we<00:01:52.209> get

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
temperature in atmospheric gases we get

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.089 
temperature in atmospheric gases we get
a<00:01:52.390> drying<00:01:52.840> effect<00:01:53.080> because<00:01:53.709> we've<00:01:53.830> got<00:01:53.920> lots

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
a drying effect because we've got lots

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.550 
a drying effect because we've got lots
of<00:01:54.160> gases<00:01:54.580> going<00:01:54.880> through<00:01:55.119> there<00:01:55.330> but<00:01:56.289> it's

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
of gases going through there but it's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.609 
of gases going through there but it's
not<00:01:57.099> sufficiently<00:01:57.940> energetic<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:59.200> destroy

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
not sufficiently energetic to destroy

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.249 
not sufficiently energetic to destroy
the<00:02:00.039> fruit<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:01.420> happened<00:02:01.869> was<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.229> were

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the fruit what happened was we were

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.059 
the fruit what happened was we were
trying<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.860> treat<00:02:03.099> strawberries<00:02:03.789> as<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.060> test

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
trying to treat strawberries as a test

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.100 
trying to treat strawberries as a test
to<00:02:06.069> see<00:02:06.310> if<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:07.149> plasma<00:02:07.599> that<00:02:07.630> we're<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:07.959> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
to see if the plasma that we're going to

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.570 
to see if the plasma that we're going to
use<00:02:08.319> would<00:02:08.739> actually<00:02:09.039> affect<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
use would actually affect the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.420 
use would actually affect the
strawberries<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.920> basically<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.040> did<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
strawberries and basically we did the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.860 
strawberries and basically we did the
test<00:02:12.670> they<00:02:12.819> looked<00:02:13.000> alright<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.569> left<00:02:13.750> them

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
test they looked alright so we left them

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.240 
test they looked alright so we left them
over<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> weekend<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.650> came<00:02:14.830> back<00:02:14.860> after

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
over the weekend and we came back after

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420 
over the weekend and we came back after
the<00:02:15.340> weekend<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.120> they<00:02:17.020> were<00:02:17.080> beautiful<00:02:17.830> no

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the weekend and they were beautiful no

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.930 
the weekend and they were beautiful no
fur<00:02:18.700> no<00:02:19.270> nothing<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.500> we<00:02:20.890> suddenly<00:02:21.400> realized

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
fur no nothing so we suddenly realized

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.460 
fur no nothing so we suddenly realized
that<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.209> had<00:02:22.390> something<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.930> our<00:02:23.080> hands<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
that we had something on our hands that

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.710 
that we had something on our hands that
was<00:02:23.650> impossible<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> great<00:02:25.330> value

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
was impossible going to be a great value

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.610 
was impossible going to be a great value
for<00:02:25.750> stopping<00:02:26.440> fruit<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.250> forward<00:02:27.730> okay<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
for stopping fruit going forward okay so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.010 
for stopping fruit going forward okay so
kit<00:02:29.620> behind<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.160> research<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.330> lots<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.840> boxes

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
kit behind you research so lots of boxes

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.069 
kit behind you research so lots of boxes
gas<00:02:32.620> cylinders<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:33.459> sorts<00:02:33.879> of<00:02:33.940> things<00:02:34.180> quite

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
gas cylinders all sorts of things quite

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.630 
gas cylinders all sorts of things quite
frankly<00:02:35.469> not<00:02:35.709> compatible<00:02:36.069> with<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.489> food

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
frankly not compatible with the food

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.130 
frankly not compatible with the food
industry<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.920> we

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
industry so what we

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.930 
industry so what we
done<00:02:39.560> with<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> guys<00:02:40.160> at<00:02:40.340> Loughborough<00:02:40.550> is

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
done with the guys at Loughborough is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.370 
done with the guys at Loughborough is
that<00:02:41.090> they've<00:02:41.210> designed<00:02:41.570> these<00:02:41.720> little<00:02:42.020> boxes

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
that they've designed these little boxes

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.800 
that they've designed these little boxes
okay<00:02:42.860> which<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.490> another<00:02:43.880> way<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.180> producing

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
okay which is another way of producing

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.450 
okay which is another way of producing
the<00:02:45.850> plasmas<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:48.020> this<00:02:48.170> mesh<00:02:48.470> so

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
the plasmas so now we have this mesh so

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.310 
the plasmas so now we have this mesh so
whatnot<00:02:49.820> we<00:02:50.120> haven't<00:02:50.360> got<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> tiny<00:02:50.960> point

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
whatnot we haven't got a tiny point

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.690 
whatnot we haven't got a tiny point
plume<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.010> start<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.310> get<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.460> bigger

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
plume it's now start to get a bigger

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.580 
plume it's now start to get a bigger
area<00:02:52.970> if<00:02:53.690> we're<00:02:53.930> going<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.170> treat

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
area if we're going to treat

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.780 
area if we're going to treat
strawberries<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.100> production<00:02:55.340> line<00:02:55.490> you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
strawberries on a production line you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.980 
strawberries on a production line you
can't<00:02:56.000> do<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.240> strawberry<00:02:56.420> rush<00:02:56.660> strawberry

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
can't do it strawberry rush strawberry

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.990 
can't do it strawberry rush strawberry
so<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.530> format<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.130> now<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.760> this

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
so we have to format it now so that this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.480 
so we have to format it now so that this
is<00:02:59.210> compatible<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.810> bigger<00:03:00.590> areas<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.220> fruit

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
is compatible with bigger areas of fruit

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.610 
is compatible with bigger areas of fruit
so<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.240> whole<00:03:02.690> area<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.230> would<00:03:03.470> be

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
so this is whole area this would be

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.980 
so this is whole area this would be
plume<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.670> were<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.910> darkened<00:03:05.240> room<00:03:05.330> you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
plume if we were in a darkened room you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.980 
plume if we were in a darkened room you
could<00:03:06.170> see<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.410> much<00:03:06.530> more<00:03:06.709> clearly

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
could see it much more clearly

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
could see it much more clearly
so<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.260> where<00:03:09.410> princey<00:03:09.830> works<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:12.010> she's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
so this is where princey works so she's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.490 
so this is where princey works so she's
been<00:03:13.130> doing<00:03:13.280> some<00:03:13.459> experiments<00:03:14.090> both<00:03:15.050> with

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
been doing some experiments both with

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.530 
been doing some experiments both with
and<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.430> sort<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.670> fundamental<00:03:17.150> stuff<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.480> we

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
and the sort of fundamental stuff so we

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.940 
and the sort of fundamental stuff so we
have<00:03:17.630> lots<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.840> nice<00:03:18.020> plates<00:03:18.350> with<00:03:18.560> fungal

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
have lots of nice plates with fungal

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.590 
have lots of nice plates with fungal
because<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:19.790> we<00:03:19.910> want<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.120> understand<00:03:20.480> is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
because what we want to understand is

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.050 
because what we want to understand is
how<00:03:20.630> they<00:03:21.290> die<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:22.640> we<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.850> some

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
how they die so here we have some

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.940 
how they die so here we have some
strawberries<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.810> basically<00:03:24.410> what<00:03:24.650> we<00:03:24.739> have

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
strawberries and basically what we have

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.220 
strawberries and basically what we have
is<00:03:25.190> two<00:03:25.400> parts<00:03:25.730> treated<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.300> untreated<00:03:26.360> all

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
is two parts treated and untreated all

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.440 
is two parts treated and untreated all
of<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.680> whiteness<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.520> can<00:03:28.700> see<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.239> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
of that whiteness you can see is the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.320 
of that whiteness you can see is the
funky<00:03:29.840> sign<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.350> grow<00:03:30.880> okay<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.270> see

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
funky sign to grow okay and you can see

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.850 
funky sign to grow okay and you can see
the<00:03:32.540> juice<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.930> coming<00:03:33.200> out<00:03:33.350> because<00:03:33.680> it's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
the juice is coming out because it's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.560 
the juice is coming out because it's
breaking<00:03:34.070> down<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.550> tissue<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.120> releasing

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
breaking down the tissue and releasing

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.780 
breaking down the tissue and releasing
the<00:03:35.660> juices<00:03:36.080> okay<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:37.190> not<00:03:37.340> nice

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
the juices okay that's not nice

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.060 
the juices okay that's not nice
no<00:03:37.940> that's<00:03:38.420> not<00:03:38.600> good<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.050> then<00:03:39.590> here<00:03:39.890> is<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
no that's not good and then here is the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.259 
no that's not good and then here is the
treated<00:03:40.459> foot<00:03:40.810> nice<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:41.840> dry<00:03:42.260> fungal<00:03:43.160> free<00:03:43.370> we

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
treated foot nice and dry fungal free we

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.000 
treated foot nice and dry fungal free we
cannot<00:03:44.690> possibly<00:03:44.959> get<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.650> point<00:03:45.890> we<00:03:45.980> have

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
cannot possibly get to the point we have

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.300 
cannot possibly get to the point we have
sterilized<00:03:46.760> fruit<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.769> in<00:03:48.769> some<00:03:49.070> ways<00:03:49.190> you

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
sterilized fruit and in some ways you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.680 
sterilized fruit and in some ways you
wouldn't<00:03:49.489> want<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.820> it's<00:03:50.090> going<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.269> go<00:03:50.420> off

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
wouldn't want it it's going to go off

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.750 
wouldn't want it it's going to go off
anyway<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:51.680> going<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:51.890> dry<00:03:52.190> up<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.580> going<00:03:52.700> to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
anyway it's going to dry up is going to

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.150 
anyway it's going to dry up is going to
be<00:03:52.820> tasteless<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:53.560> all<00:03:54.560> we're<00:03:54.709> looking<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:55.040> do

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
be tasteless so all we're looking to do

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.100 
be tasteless so all we're looking to do
is<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.489> knock<00:03:55.970> back<00:03:56.209> those<00:03:56.450> funghi<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.840> couple

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
is to knock back those funghi a couple

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.140 
is to knock back those funghi a couple
of<00:03:57.200> days<00:03:57.380> slow<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.250> all<00:03:58.370> down<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:58.970> don't

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
of days slow it all down so you don't

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.780 
of days slow it all down so you don't
get<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.450> pun<00:03:59.630> it's<00:03:59.750> loss<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.650> end<00:04:00.860> game<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.730> to

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
get the pun it's loss the end game is to

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.780 
get the pun it's loss the end game is to
produce<00:04:02.360> something<00:04:02.720> that's<00:04:02.840> very<00:04:03.140> practical

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
produce something that's very practical

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.070 
produce something that's very practical
that's<00:04:04.790> something<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.239> we<00:04:05.330> can<00:04:05.480> take<00:04:05.690> for

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
that's something that we can take for

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.170 
that's something that we can take for
the<00:04:06.170> food<00:04:06.380> industry<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.040> allow<00:04:07.850> them<00:04:08.150> to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the food industry and allow them to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.390 
the food industry and allow them to
reduce<00:04:08.570> spoilage<00:04:08.840> okay<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.890> for<00:04:10.220> them

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
reduce spoilage okay so that for them

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.560 
reduce spoilage okay so that for them
that<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.360> an<00:04:11.540> issue<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:12.370> less<00:04:13.370> losses<00:04:13.820> okay<00:04:14.390> so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
that is an issue of less losses okay so

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.320 
that is an issue of less losses okay so
is<00:04:14.900> an<00:04:15.019> economic<00:04:15.500> benefit<00:04:15.920> but<00:04:16.549> also<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:17.060> terms

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
is an economic benefit but also in terms

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.890 
is an economic benefit but also in terms
of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.660> amount<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.019> stuff<00:04:18.410> we<00:04:18.620> throw<00:04:18.950> away

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
of the amount of stuff we throw away

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.390 
of the amount of stuff we throw away
annually<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.200> mat<00:04:21.350> food<00:04:21.680> waste<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.160> we<00:04:22.220> get

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
annually the mat food waste that we get

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.460 
annually the mat food waste that we get
through<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.729> massive<00:04:23.390> so<00:04:23.870> anything<00:04:24.140> we<00:04:24.229> can<00:04:24.260> do

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
through is massive so anything we can do

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.200 
through is massive so anything we can do
to<00:04:24.620> contribute<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.580> reducing<00:04:26.060> that

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
to contribute to that to reducing that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.719 
to contribute to that to reducing that
food<00:04:26.419> waste<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.530> we<00:04:27.770> see<00:04:27.950> as<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.310> positive

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
food waste you know we see as a positive

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.780 
food waste you know we see as a positive
benefit<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.960> that's<00:04:30.140> our<00:04:30.440> end<00:04:30.680> game<00:04:30.919> but<00:04:31.190> as<00:04:31.729> a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
benefit so that's our end game but as a

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.030 
benefit so that's our end game but as a
scientist<00:04:32.300> my<00:04:33.080> end<00:04:33.320> game<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.680> know<00:04:33.890> how

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
scientist my end game is to know how

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.180 
scientist my end game is to know how
it's<00:04:34.190> working<00:04:34.660> we've<00:04:35.660> tried<00:04:35.960> raspberries<00:04:36.950> and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
it's working we've tried raspberries and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.760 
it's working we've tried raspberries and
that<00:04:37.850> works<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.390> blueberries<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.229> other

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that works and blueberries and other

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.980 
that works and blueberries and other
soft<00:04:40.040> fruits<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.520> very<00:04:41.210> very<00:04:41.419> generic

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
soft fruits so very very generic

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.810 
soft fruits so very very generic
technology<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.800> do<00:04:43.340> know<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:44.210> can't<00:04:44.540> do<00:04:44.870> herbs

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
technology I do know you can't do herbs

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.610 
technology I do know you can't do herbs
we<00:04:46.820> can<00:04:47.000> make<00:04:47.210> black<00:04:47.630> slime<00:04:48.020> out<00:04:48.229> of<00:04:48.410> herbs

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
we can make black slime out of herbs

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.350 
we can make black slime out of herbs
faster<00:04:49.280> than<00:04:49.400> anybody<00:04:49.820> else<00:04:50.000> with<00:04:50.240> this

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
faster than anybody else with this

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.640 
faster than anybody else with this
technology<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.470> is

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
technology so it is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.680 
technology so it is
case<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:52.009> it<00:04:52.100> will<00:04:52.220> be<00:04:52.340> niche<00:04:52.580> things<00:04:53.419> that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
case of it will be niche things that

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.570 
case of it will be niche things that
have<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> nice<00:04:54.080> good<00:04:54.410> solid<00:04:54.710> surface<00:04:55.340> will

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
have a nice good solid surface will

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.240 
have a nice good solid surface will
stand<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.030> plasma<00:04:56.360> treatment<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.440> we<00:04:58.040> think

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
stand the plasma treatment but we think

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.350 
stand the plasma treatment but we think
there's<00:04:58.400> quite<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.580> few<00:04:58.639> things<00:04:59.000> out<00:04:59.090> there<00:04:59.330> we

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
there's quite a few things out there we

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.540 
there's quite a few things out there we
can<00:04:59.570> treat<00:04:59.750> why<00:05:00.590> should<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:00.949> be<00:05:01.160> excited<00:05:01.400> about

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
can treat why should I be excited about

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.040 
can treat why should I be excited about
this<00:05:01.789> what<00:05:02.000> am<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.270> going<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.539> get<00:05:02.660> out<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.930> this

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
this what am I going to get out of this

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.260 
this what am I going to get out of this
you're<00:05:03.710> going<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:04.190> get<00:05:04.310> less<00:05:04.490> frustrated<00:05:05.120> when

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
you're going to get less frustrated when

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.640 
you're going to get less frustrated when
you<00:05:05.389> take<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.690> home<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.050> it<00:05:06.169> goes<00:05:06.289> horribly

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
you take it home and it goes horribly

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.260 
you take it home and it goes horribly
furry<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:08.410> if<00:05:09.410> all<00:05:10.100> things<00:05:10.400> are<00:05:10.610> equal<00:05:10.669> it

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
furry and if all things are equal it

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.050 
furry and if all things are equal it
should<00:05:11.509> get<00:05:11.690> cheaper
