00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi everybody demanded it and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.950
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.019
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and in 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.660
 this trick then I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.919
 get infinite rp after all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.660
 the patches after the missions that 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.430
 they have removed have put back and some 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 things have not worked 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.940
 after the patch as well as this is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.190
 one of the missions that for now 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.710
 can do and it goes very well, I'll leave you 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.150
 the description of this video the channel of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 spam gel and ximo vale he has discovered 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.290
 the trick assured we're going to start with the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.969
 tutorial and so well then everything 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.609
 first thing we have to do is be 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.440
 an online game we are going to start we are going to 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.989
 online and here in activities we give 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.480
 we are going to host an activity and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.760
 here we go to the one created by 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.859
 rockstar we go to missions and we search 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.109
 So the dirt road we give 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.059
 here and we accept this mission 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.819
 we'll do it alone so there's no 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.379
 no problem we can do it without 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.479
 is nobody else in the game we do 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.159
 us alone and simply what there is 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.469
 what to do is put the settings as 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.329
 we want, and then 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.890
 start the mission simply because 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 we have to go to the green site be 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.880
 marked to the goal and when we see there 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.039
 we have to kill everyone 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.289
 friends that are here simply because 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.390
 we kill them and when we have them 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.729
 killed or that in some we have to go 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 because the goal that is green is the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 goal we pick up the package and we go 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 towards a helicopter for that we have 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 have to call the pegasus and we have to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.460
 have a bus to it that is the most 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.899
 manageable in the air is worth so good 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.829
 when we get inside the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.869
 helicopter 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 we will have to go to the yellow point worth 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.420
 when we are there we will have to 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.799
 go down slowly and put on just 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 in the yellow point but without reaching 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.270
 touch the ground simply what 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.130
 we have to do is to be flush and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.990
 we'll have to drive from there all the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.599
 time without stopping and we will see and we will get 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.340
 then 25 points all the time without stopping the 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.929
 true that a trick after the patch 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.939
 after all we have already climbed 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.909
 and the truth is that it's going pretty well for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.310
 level up I recommend being at 120 o 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
 so it's worth not going up a lot because 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.599
 If you can not manage to drive like 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.369
 what happened with the dns is that I should tell you 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.470
 good news that the lines already 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.630
 are going back I'll try 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.120
 bring them as soon as possible and 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.450
 have this time much more care than 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 before 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.390
