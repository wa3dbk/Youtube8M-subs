00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello friends and investors welcome to our learning room 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.950
 I am from Upper Bavaria, I will explain in this video about the standard of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.440
 that he was the flame of the falling star or the contents tarr 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.480
 the shooting star is a low pattern that signals reversal of a movement 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.560
 high price for low moving 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.919
 what are its main characteristics 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.060
 first 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.140
 occurs after a high 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 formed by only a small one with a small body at the bottom and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630
 a long top shadow 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.629
 the third 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.629
 the upper shadow should be at least the bull of the body size 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.620
 Preferably, there should be no less than 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.060
 but they accepted the little shadow 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.620
 and lastly the color of the body is not important it means that the beloved 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.750
 can be high 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.450
 low 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 what are the factors that potentiate shooting star 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.810
 first runs out of the region occupied by the body of the inner kindle ' 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.970
 second 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.700
 the lower the body in May the upper shadow 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 more significant will be the reversal pattern 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.210
 and finally the formation of the pattern within a downward trend of the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.380
 price or in an area of ​​resistance in the brusque the good still with a volume of 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 above-average trading 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.630
 the formation of the shooting star usually provides an opportunity 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.060
 of sales 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.979
 however it is advisable to have stored the confirmation signal in the next 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.770
 it's wrong 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 the opening price below the closing of the shooting star 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.100
 who went down with the closing price 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.009
 below the closing of the shooting star 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.009
 better still if it is below the minimum 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.690
 to the example in the daily chart of bbs 3 we can observe the occurrence of 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.920
 a shooting star first the stock price is seeing a good 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.109
 high movement 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:26.359
 then there was the formation of the beloved low standard with the small body in the 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.979
 lower part 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.609
 long shadow upper 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.529
 with a small lower shadow on the next being we had two signs of 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.459
 confirmation 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.030
 first the opening price below the closing and then closing below the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.199
 shooting star minimum 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.829
 in this case the formation of the bearish pattern revealed an opportunity to sell 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.569
 which has resulted in a large drop in the share price 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.079
 congratulations 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.829
