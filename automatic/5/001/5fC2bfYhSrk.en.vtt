00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
opponents will actually use it quite

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.160 
opponents will actually use it quite
often<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.620> student<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.450> depending<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.630> your

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
often too student on depending on your

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.750 
often too student on depending on your
difficulty<00:01:55.920> level<00:01:59.870> it's<00:02:00.870> not<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.410> bad<00:02:01.760> until

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
difficulty level it's not so bad until

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.240 
difficulty level it's not so bad until
you<00:02:02.820> beat<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> first<00:02:03.870> game<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:05.070> time

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you beat the first game the first time

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.350 
you beat the first game the first time
through<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.960> when<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.700> hard<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:09.210> hard

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
through and when you do hard very hard

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:32.690 
through and when you do hard very hard
and<00:02:09.960> see<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:15.210> they<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:31.700> it's

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and see if it's then they do it all it's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.350 
and see if it's then they do it all it's
called<00:02:33.030> ultimate<00:02:33.870> move<00:02:34.290> attack<00:02:35.360> basically

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
called ultimate move attack basically

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
called ultimate move attack basically
the<00:02:36.660> same<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> normal<00:02:37.260> position<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.280> send

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
the same as a normal position you send

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.949 
the same as a normal position you send
your<00:02:38.640> opponent<00:02:39.030> flying<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.510> pursue<00:02:39.840> an

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
your opponent flying you pursue an

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
your opponent flying you pursue an
attack

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.250 

now<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:46.379> one<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:47.430> don't<00:02:48.319> do<00:02:49.319> quite<00:02:49.860> often

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
now this one I don't do quite often

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.170 
now this one I don't do quite often
maybe<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.799> do<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:52.980> more<00:02:53.400> often<00:02:53.610> than<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.120> do

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
maybe I could do it more often than I do

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.170 
maybe I could do it more often than I do
it<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:57.080> find<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.349> kind<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.709> hard<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
it but I find it kind of hard to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.110 
it but I find it kind of hard to
actually<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.799> get<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.980> person<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.579> multiple

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
actually I get the person that multiple

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.350 
actually I get the person that multiple
times<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.760> when<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:05.879> launch<00:03:06.150> them

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
times because that when they launch them

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.039 
times because that when they launch them
