00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.490
 Mr. Sant Paul today closes a cycle 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.700
 or do you want to win the world cup with 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.840
 Chile 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 I do not want to enjoy this moment together 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.740
 with the players who will have achieved 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.960
 win the america cup in chile 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.450
 with all the euphoric people after not 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.370
 have never won it I only think of 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.660
 that another afternoon 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.700
 that the moments pass and try to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.700
 thank this group of players that 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.300
 allowed me to be part of this achievement that 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.160
 it was very very valuable against a second of 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.610
 the selection that but the strongest of the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.320
 world so happy with that in the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.500
 rest of the cycles obviously not 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.710
 it is not time to analyze it use the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.150
 radio jorge goodnight congratulations 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.220
 Carlos FernÃ¡ndez we are live for 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.589
 the region of ValparaÃ­so the Tata Martino 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.960
 he said it was a match even that but 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.570
 that they made me win them and the other 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.800
 that basically has been spoken in the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.810
 social networks and some media 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.220
 trasandinos and Uruguayans that little 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.560
 except this championship was fixed 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.920
 good night 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 I do not know how to ask me for the match 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.189
 it seems that the Chilean proposal was 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 superior to that of argentina in the in the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.290
 attack volume 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 we try to get to consolidate the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.310
 collective attack or positional attack 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 I found a defense very back very 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.979
 solid that was waiting for our 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.899
 error it seems to me that the team had the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.520
 possibility of dominating a team with 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.439
 the ball to such an important team 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
 as Argentina encouraging itself to play 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.909
 back with the high pressure of the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.190
 Argentine selection I think it was a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 great match of chile I think that could 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.020
 have won it because of the chance it had 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.400
 during the 90 events during the 90s 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.190
 minutes 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.820
 and I'm staying with that, I'm not left with that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.400
 the most risky impression because 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.570
 after watching the game and analyzing it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.090
 I can count on more certainties 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.620
 evaluation 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.390
 but to know that a team like Chile 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.450
 had the courage to play this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.800
 final formula the truth that I have to 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.780
 take out the hat because obviously 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.230
 this group is all about playing with a lot 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.319
 hierarchy and as I told you and a lot 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.069
 sobriety against a selection that 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.430
 obviously has a large 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.430
 players
