00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
windows but um you know before they

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.720 
windows but um you know before they
could<00:03:17.110> but<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.769> would<00:03:17.890> run<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.280> slow<00:03:18.340> but

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
could but it would run really slow but

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.120 
could but it would run really slow but
with<00:03:18.970> quad-core<00:03:19.630> processors<00:03:20.350> now<00:03:20.590> it's<00:03:20.860> it's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
with quad-core processors now it's it's

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.539 
with quad-core processors now it's it's
amazing<00:03:21.640> what<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.850> can<00:03:21.880> do<00:03:22.150> um<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:24.190> that's

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
pretty much it also uses sony bravia

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.789 
pretty much it also uses sony bravia
engine<00:03:26.500> for<00:03:27.010> better<00:03:27.280> photos<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.239> videos<00:03:28.799> but

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799
