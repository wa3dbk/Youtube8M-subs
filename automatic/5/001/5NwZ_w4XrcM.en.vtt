 for me this career I like I like 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 worth the case is that this is very random and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260

 slipstream you can not really catch 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.890

 come and come for your house mates 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.380
 I shit in the building and I shit on 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.410
 the uncle who planted the building and site 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.970
 ok boy later last try to see 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.160
 if in this case we can win uncle madryn 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.510
 it's complicated it's quite complicated 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.850
 because there is no slip of anything to be able 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.700
 put you first so the case is that a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.560
 see how we get in this case the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.510
 race my god gives me a fear when 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.070
 we look for all and curve goodbye eye worth 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.070
 eye that we are warned my god 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.100
 it was obvious it was obvious that that was going to happen 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.390
 is that it was obvious uncle here only 13 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.140
 in between the planes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.020
 Eladio seems that destiny has done 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.110
 that this race does not do anything is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.660
 impossible in the impossible boy race 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:15.010
 gave for good people at least I do not have 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.970
 stuck lad worth voucher okay let's go 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.720
 third 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.740
 eye because to see if they stick it or something 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.430
 for the second one he just hit 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.770
 how the first one got it won 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.080
 basically worth eye as seconds 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.210
 let's do the first one in the first one do not 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.280
 the catch even for attractive wynton mica 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.840
 kid besides the first one that just 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 to be first to the poor man expelled 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.530
 twice before starting to win a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.030
 Pulsed times and not in the race 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.530
 previous I think it was it ejects two 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.550
 times in a row because there are times in 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.660
 where you put the skill button 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.640
 silencer since it knows institution in 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.050
 everyone out of the way as 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.820
 there are people who have where to put the button 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.080
 to mute has eject button 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.850
 then I'm wrong I give him the expulsion 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.680
 about twice and it seems 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.750
 has given me more than 2,000 deserved by 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.110
 eject right away there's a boy posts 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.110
 I all the truth that I believe and 6-2 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.050
 and 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.519
 i
