crappy<00:00:18.779> recording<00:00:19.410> device<00:00:19.850> I've<00:00:20.850> done<00:00:21.210> some

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
crappy recording device I've done some

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.380 
crappy recording device I've done some
pics<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.830> arm<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:25.130> today<00:00:26.130> i<00:00:26.490> am<00:00:27.119> here

to<00:00:27.779> show<00:00:28.109> off<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.800> research<00:00:29.460> pack<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.830> 1.6<00:00:31.910> these

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to show off a research pack of 1.6 these

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.100 
to show off a research pack of 1.6 these
things<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.570> able<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> change<00:00:34.399> textures

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
things are able to change textures

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.979 
things are able to change textures
sounds<00:00:37.399> one<00:00:38.399> sec<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.210> bothering<00:00:39.750> me

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sounds one sec that's bothering me

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.979 
sounds one sec that's bothering me
because<00:00:40.790> none<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.090> other<00:00:42.270> cuts<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
because none of the other cuts like that

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
because none of the other cuts like that
kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> changes<00:00:46.469> pixel<00:00:46.980> farm<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.960> um<00:00:49.520> showing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
kind of changes pixel farm so um showing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
kind of changes pixel farm so um showing
off<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> research<00:00:51.360> pack<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.260> research<00:00:52.739> pack

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
off a research pack this research pack

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.360 
off a research pack this research pack
is<00:00:53.309> called<00:00:53.610> bows<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.629> lasers<00:00:55.219> which<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is called bows to lasers which is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
is called bows to lasers which is
awesome<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.489> lasers<00:01:00.140> here<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
awesome because you know lasers here in

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.329 
awesome because you know lasers here in
my<00:01:01.649> hand<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> bow<00:01:03.379> although<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
my hand is a bow although it is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.410 
my hand is a bow although it is
technically<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> laser<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:08.240> that's<00:01:09.240> exactly

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
technically a laser and that's exactly

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.370 
technically a laser and that's exactly
that<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.549> its<00:01:11.760> own<00:01:11.909> sound<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that it has its own sound too which is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
that it has its own sound too which is
awesome<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.420> research

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
awesome because you can do them research

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
awesome because you can do them research
backs<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.280> research<00:01:17.700> packs<00:01:18.030> you're<00:01:18.330> also

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
backs now in research packs you're also

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.330 
backs now in research packs you're also
able<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.369> change<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.630> words<00:01:22.229> make<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> new

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
able to change the words make a new

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.600 
able to change the words make a new
language<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.210> arm<00:01:25.340> like<00:01:26.340> for

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
language pretty much arm like for

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
language pretty much arm like for
example<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.840> click

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
example when they go in here and click

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.300 
example when they go in here and click
here<00:01:28.470> there's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> bunch<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.100> languages<00:01:29.900> but<00:01:30.900> um

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
here there's a bunch of languages but um

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.030 
here there's a bunch of languages but um
the<00:01:32.310> name<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> bow<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.200> name<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the name of the bow and the name of the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.490 
the name of the bow and the name of the
arrows<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.780> changed<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.729> wondering<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.030> I'm

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
arrows what changed I'm wondering if I'm

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
arrows what changed I'm wondering if I'm
i<00:01:41.180> wonder<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> made<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.840> different

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
i wonder if you made it a different

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.770 
i wonder if you made it a different
language<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.430> unknown<00:01:44.579> reason<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.540> um

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
language for some unknown reason but um

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
language for some unknown reason but um
I<00:01:46.399> don't<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I don't think so and it just kind of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
I don't think so and it just kind of
weird<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.799> um<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.479> took<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.799> over<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
weird so um I took my time to go over to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700 
weird so um I took my time to go over to
an<00:01:56.880> anvil<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> change<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> name<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
an anvil here and change the name to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.940 
an anvil here and change the name to
laser<00:01:59.280> gun<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.969> ammo<00:02:00.479> i<00:02:00.509> also<00:02:03.439> added<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
laser gun and ammo i also added a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.760 
laser gun and ammo i also added a
enchantment<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> laser<00:02:06.960> gun<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.560> has

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
enchantment on to the laser gun it has

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
enchantment on to the laser gun it has
power<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:09.509> an<00:02:09.899> infinity<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> i<00:02:12.450> could

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
power for an infinity one so i could

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.700 
power for an infinity one so i could
crack

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
crack

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.340 
crack
we<00:02:13.920> go<00:02:14.070> into<00:02:14.400> survival<00:02:14.700> here<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.140> like

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
we go into survival here and just like

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.120 
we go into survival here and just like
murder<00:02:17.010> everything<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:18.150> I've<00:02:18.450> already

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130
