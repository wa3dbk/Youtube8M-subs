00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.979 
once you accept the revive then you have
to<00:02:10.379> stand<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> then<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.269> can<00:02:12.420> run<00:02:12.630> away<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
to stand up and then you can run away so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.650 
to stand up and then you can run away so
the<00:02:13.349> animation<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.519> really<00:02:14.790> clunky<00:02:15.480> in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the animation is really really clunky in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.339 
the animation is really really clunky in
that<00:02:15.959> way<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.799> in<00:02:16.980> bf4<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.390> case<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.110> that

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
that way but in bf4 the case is that

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.850 
that way but in bf4 the case is that
okay<00:02:20.069> someone<00:02:20.640> kill<00:02:20.790> me<00:02:20.910> again<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:24.470> get<00:02:25.470> revived

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and then I sprint right away it might

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.009 
and then I sprint right away it might

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.530 
but on the enemy's side on his point of
view<00:02:35.010> you're<00:02:35.280> actually<00:02:35.640> sliding<00:02:36.000> across<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
view you're actually sliding across the

would stand up and then run away so
because<00:02:48.750> there's<00:02:48.989> cover<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
because there's cover here so that's a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.039 
because there's cover here so that's a
pretty<00:02:51.810> useful<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.380> basically<00:02:53.930> once<00:02:54.930> you

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
pretty useful thing basically once you

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.330 
pretty useful thing basically once you
get<00:02:55.230> revived<00:02:55.620> you're<00:02:55.889> in<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.069> prone<00:02:56.310> position

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
get revived you're in a prone position

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.120 
get revived you're in a prone position
like<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.690> accept<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.319> revive<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.950> then

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
like this you accept the revive and then

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.309 
like this you accept the revive and then
you<00:02:59.250> sprint<00:02:59.670> right<00:03:00.000> away<00:03:00.239> as<00:03:00.420> fast<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.109> can

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
you sprint right away as fast as you can

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.879

you<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.190> quickly<00:03:03.180> because

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
you have to do this quickly because

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.559 
you have to do this quickly because
without<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.250> speed<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.940> animation<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.540> not

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
without the speed the animation is not

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.210 
without the speed the animation is not
going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> kick<00:03:07.170> in

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.340 

to<00:03:13.490> give<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.730> guys<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.240> that<00:03:14.570> when<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.050> quick
