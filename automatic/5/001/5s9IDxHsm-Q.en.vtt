00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
so yeah we're working on three concepts

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.919 
so yeah we're working on three concepts
right<00:00:56.449> now<00:00:57.249> one<00:00:58.249> of<00:00:58.280> them<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:58.729> two<00:00:59.659> bit<00:00:59.989> pixel

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
right now one of them is a two bit pixel

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.270 
right now one of them is a two bit pixel

sure we have all the fit correct
for<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.120> bike<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.570> then<00:02:32.810> from<00:02:33.050> here<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.700> will

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
for the bike and then from here I will

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.790 
for the bike and then from here I will
send<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.090> file<00:02:35.300> out<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.990> actual<00:02:36.440> details

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
send this file out for actual details

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.300 
send this file out for actual details
and<00:02:37.400> get<00:02:37.940> everything<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:39.160> apply<00:02:40.160> them<00:02:40.280> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and get everything in and apply them to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.420 
and get everything in and apply them to
the<00:02:40.490> frame<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.990> this<00:02:42.260> frame<00:02:42.560> here<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.070> actually

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
the frame so this frame here is actually

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.110 
the frame so this frame here is actually
for<00:02:43.900> another<00:02:45.430> bike<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.610> we're<00:02:46.730> doing<00:02:46.820> for

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
for another bike that we're doing for

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.090 
for another bike that we're doing for
him<00:02:47.300> which<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.050> received<00:02:48.380> details<00:02:48.800> for

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
him which I just received details for

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.810 
him which I just received details for
later<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:51.230> today<00:02:51.380> I'll<00:02:51.650> be<00:02:51.800> applying<00:02:52.250> those<00:02:52.580> to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
later on today I'll be applying those to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.220 
later on today I'll be applying those to
this<00:02:52.910> actual<00:02:53.270> frame<00:02:53.540> I'm<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.900> using<00:02:54.050> this

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
this actual frame I'm just using this

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.620 
this actual frame I'm just using this
one<00:02:54.380> first<00:02:54.590> sizing<00:02:55.010> right<00:02:55.160> now<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.450> from

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
one first sizing right now so so from

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.620 
one first sizing right now so so from
the<00:02:56.840> artwork<00:02:57.340> design<00:02:58.340> all<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.210> through

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
the artwork design all the way through

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.930 
the artwork design all the way through
production<00:03:00.590> decals<00:03:01.310> how<00:03:01.550> long<00:03:01.730> does<00:03:01.880> that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
production decals how long does that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.480 
production decals how long does that
take<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:03.170> depends<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.740> scheme<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.310> one

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
take that depends on the scheme this one

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.690 
take that depends on the scheme this one
here<00:03:04.760> we're<00:03:04.970> looking<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.950> probably<00:03:06.950> somewhere

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
here we're looking at probably somewhere

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.370 
here we're looking at probably somewhere
in<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.920> two<00:03:09.920> three<00:03:10.220> four<00:03:10.430> hour<00:03:10.610> range<00:03:11.350> by<00:03:12.350> the

say somewhere between seven and 12
people<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.920> depending<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.610> bike<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
people so depending on the bike the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.820 
people so depending on the bike the
scheme<00:04:01.570> things<00:04:02.320> like<00:04:02.470> that

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
scheme things like that

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.560 
scheme things like that
and<00:04:03.070> what's<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.460> fastest<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.850> fastest<00:04:07.390> is

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
and what's the fastest the fastest is

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.690 
and what's the fastest the fastest is
probably<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.530> one<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.190> actually<00:04:09.460> gonna

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
Newson scheme they sent us files that

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.130 
Newson scheme they sent us files that
were<00:04:16.750> essentially<00:04:17.650> ready<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.100> go<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.150> we<00:04:19.450> we

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
were essentially ready to go so we we

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.130 
were essentially ready to go so we we
did<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> quick<00:04:21.489> check<00:04:21.580> on<00:04:22.150> him<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.540> shipped<00:04:23.020> him

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
did a quick check on him and shipped him

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.160 
did a quick check on him and shipped him
off<00:04:23.230> for<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:24.490> decals<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.090> they<00:04:25.840> came<00:04:26.050> back

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
off for the decals and they came back

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.440 
off for the decals and they came back
and<00:04:26.490> I'll<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.640> put<00:04:27.790> them<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.090> afternoon

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
and I'll be put them on this afternoon

and I'll be put them on this afternoon
so<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.630> bike<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.080> really<00:04:29.640> start<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.790> end<00:04:31.170> us

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
so that bike is really start to end us

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.350 
so that bike is really start to end us
in<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.380> couple<00:04:32.560> hours<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.060> same

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.989 

for<00:04:38.319> project<00:04:38.739> one<00:04:41.429> that's<00:04:42.429> a<00:04:42.579> little<00:04:42.819> bit

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
for project one that's a little bit

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.239 
for project one that's a little bit
different<00:04:43.179> we<00:04:43.389> don't<00:04:43.569> have<00:04:43.749> specific<00:04:44.709> weight

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
different we don't have specific weight

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.059 
different we don't have specific weight
Plus<00:04:45.549> coming<00:04:45.999> in<00:04:46.149> because<00:04:46.359> we<00:04:47.049> have<00:04:47.199> our<00:04:47.379> our

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.239 
sights set up so people can you know
they<00:04:50.109> can<00:04:50.139> pick<00:04:50.379> their<00:04:50.529> colors<00:04:50.859> and<00:04:50.889> things

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:51.249 
they can pick their colors and things

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.229 
they can pick their colors and things
like<00:04:51.369> that<00:04:52.259> but<00:04:53.259> we<00:04:53.379> don't<00:04:53.529> have<00:04:53.649> specific

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:54.239 
like that but we don't have specific

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:59.279 
like that but we don't have specific
designs<00:04:55.239> that<00:04:55.929> are<00:04:56.109> coming<00:04:56.679> through<00:04:58.109> as<00:04:59.109> far

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
designs that are coming through as far

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.859 
designs that are coming through as far
as<00:04:59.349> choosing<00:04:59.859> colors<00:05:00.189> getting<00:05:01.149> designs<00:05:01.509> set

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:01.869 
as choosing colors getting designs set

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.109 
as choosing colors getting designs set
up<00:05:02.019> for<00:05:02.229> those<00:05:02.339> the<00:05:03.339> layout<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:03.789> everything

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:04.119 
up for those the layout and everything

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.089 
up for those the layout and everything
is<00:05:04.239> identical<00:05:04.749> right<00:05:05.109> now<00:05:05.259> we<00:05:05.379> take<00:05:05.739> a<00:05:05.799> frame

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
is identical right now we take a frame

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.529 
is identical right now we take a frame
fit<00:05:06.399> everything<00:05:06.579> to<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.879> frame<00:05:07.119> then<00:05:07.359> we<00:05:07.389> have

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
fit everything to the frame then we have

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.719 
fit everything to the frame then we have
to<00:05:07.659> size<00:05:07.899> it<00:05:08.109> up<00:05:08.169> to<00:05:08.379> two<00:05:09.009> other<00:05:09.189> frames<00:05:09.549> that

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
to size it up to two other frames that

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.850 
to size it up to two other frames that
would<00:05:09.849> be<00:05:09.939> about<00:05:10.149> the<00:05:10.899> biggest<00:05:11.229> difference<00:05:11.589> is

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
would be about the biggest difference is

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.019 
would be about the biggest difference is
fitting<00:05:12.459> a<00:05:12.519> range<00:05:12.699> of<00:05:12.849> frames<00:05:13.319> but<00:05:14.319> from<00:05:14.499> there

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
fitting a range of frames but from there

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.629 
fitting a range of frames but from there
it's<00:05:16.029> pretty<00:05:16.659> similar<00:05:17.249> one<00:05:18.249> of<00:05:18.339> the<00:05:18.429> things

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
it's pretty similar one of the things

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.539 
it's pretty similar one of the things
we're<00:05:18.789> able<00:05:18.969> to<00:05:19.059> do<00:05:19.209> in-house<00:05:19.599> is<00:05:20.169> when<00:05:21.099> the

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:21.549 
we're able to do in-house is when the

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:23.850 
we're able to do in-house is when the
art<00:05:21.789> is<00:05:21.909> designed<00:05:22.239> for<00:05:22.449> each<00:05:22.539> model<00:05:23.079> it<00:05:23.439> has<00:05:23.499> to

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
art is designed for each model it has to

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.059 
art is designed for each model it has to
fit<00:05:24.039> across<00:05:24.249> all<00:05:24.999> seven<00:05:25.749> or<00:05:25.869> nine<00:05:25.899> sizes<00:05:26.769> we

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
fit across all seven or nine sizes we

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.949 
fit across all seven or nine sizes we
have<00:05:27.189> a<00:05:27.219> bunch<00:05:27.399> of<00:05:27.519> different<00:05:27.759> sizes<00:05:27.909> for<00:05:28.899> each

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:28.959 
have a bunch of different sizes for each

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.919 
have a bunch of different sizes for each
frame<00:05:29.319> and<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.789> team<00:05:31.029> is<00:05:31.059> going<00:05:31.389> through

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:31.929 
frame and this team is going through

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:33.959 
frame and this team is going through
model<00:05:32.649> by<00:05:32.739> model<00:05:33.099> and<00:05:33.189> making<00:05:33.369> sure<00:05:33.729> that

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
model by model and making sure that

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.389 
model by model and making sure that
everything<00:05:34.359> fits<00:05:34.389> properly<00:05:34.869> on<00:05:35.469> each<00:05:36.039> size

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:36.399 
everything fits properly on each size

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.659 
everything fits properly on each size
the<00:05:37.329> design<00:05:37.719> intent<00:05:38.079> needs<00:05:38.529> to<00:05:38.709> be<00:05:38.859> kept<00:05:39.129> while

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
the design intent needs to be kept while

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.819 
the design intent needs to be kept while
fitting<00:05:39.939> across<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> pretty<00:05:40.839> broad<00:05:41.199> range<00:05:41.229> of

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:41.829 
fitting across a pretty broad range of

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.859 
fitting across a pretty broad range of
tube<00:05:42.309> sizes<00:05:42.909> and<00:05:43.360> shapes

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:43.869 
tube sizes and shapes

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.769 
tube sizes and shapes
so<00:05:44.469> this<00:05:44.769> production<00:05:45.189> part<00:05:46.149> of<00:05:46.239> the<00:05:46.299> process

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
so this production part of the process

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:53.150 
so this production part of the process
is<00:05:46.959> key<00:05:48.089> how<00:05:49.089> many<00:05:49.269> sizes

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.570 

these<00:05:53.340> carbon<00:05:53.940> bikes<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:55.160> think<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.310> average

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
these carbon bikes I think the average

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.940 
these carbon bikes I think the average
is<00:05:57.770> nine<00:05:58.770> sizes<00:05:59.460> yeah<00:06:00.230> so<00:06:01.230> it's<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.590> it's<00:06:01.860> a

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
is nine sizes yeah so it's a it's a

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.030 
is nine sizes yeah so it's a it's a
pretty<00:06:02.130> broad<00:06:02.490> range<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:03.390> so<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.680> designs

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
pretty broad range and so the designs

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.370 
pretty broad range and so the designs
have<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.460> be<00:06:05.580> modified<00:06:06.180> pretty<00:06:06.630> significantly

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
have to be modified pretty significantly

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.100 
have to be modified pretty significantly
to<00:06:08.160> fit<00:06:08.370> across<00:06:08.580> all<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.150> different<00:06:09.300> shapes

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
to fit across all the different shapes

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.470 
to fit across all the different shapes
and<00:06:10.290> sizes<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:13.550> science<00:06:14.550> bike<00:06:14.790> to<00:06:15.000> work<00:06:15.180> for<00:06:15.450> a

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
and sizes a science bike to work for a

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.330 
and sizes a science bike to work for a
rider<00:06:15.750> who's<00:06:16.050> five-foot<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.770> a<00:06:16.830> rider<00:06:17.040> who's

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
rider who's five-foot and a rider who's

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.670 
rider who's five-foot and a rider who's
six<00:06:17.640> six<00:06:17.940> but<00:06:18.660> you<00:06:18.810> also<00:06:18.960> have<00:06:19.230> to<00:06:19.260> redesign

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
six six but you also have to redesign

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.010 
six six but you also have to redesign
decals<00:06:20.430> for<00:06:20.730> every<00:06:20.970> single<00:06:21.360> bite<00:06:21.510> that's

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
decals for every single bite that's

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.290 
decals for every single bite that's
right<00:06:22.350> so<00:06:22.880> that's<00:06:23.880> right

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
right so that's right

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.840 
right so that's right
so<00:06:24.450> each<00:06:24.960> bike<00:06:25.430> essentially<00:06:26.430> when<00:06:26.640> especially

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
so each bike essentially when especially

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.940 
so each bike essentially when especially
when<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.270> comes<00:06:27.420> to<00:06:27.540> carbon<00:06:27.810> bikes<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.680> gonna

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
when it comes to carbon bikes is gonna

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.460 
when it comes to carbon bikes is gonna
get<00:06:29.190> its<00:06:29.520> own<00:06:29.670> version<00:06:30.450> of<00:06:30.540> how<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.810> art<00:06:31.170> fits

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
get its own version of how the art fits

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.230 
get its own version of how the art fits
on<00:06:31.650> it<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:31.980> yes<00:06:32.190> we<00:06:32.400> have<00:06:32.430> to<00:06:32.580> go<00:06:32.760> through<00:06:33.060> and

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
on it so yes we have to go through and

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.770 
on it so yes we have to go through and
redesign<00:06:33.780> for<00:06:34.200> each<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.530> those<00:06:34.590> sizes<00:06:35.510> so<00:06:36.510> it's

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
redesign for each of those sizes so it's

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.840 
redesign for each of those sizes so it's
it's<00:06:37.560> pretty<00:06:37.650> labor-intensive<00:06:38.160> there's<00:06:38.790> a

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
it's pretty labor-intensive there's a

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.160 
it's pretty labor-intensive there's a
lot<00:06:39.000> of<00:06:39.150> design<00:06:39.240> weren't<00:06:39.630> going<00:06:39.840> into<00:06:40.020> these

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
lot of design weren't going into these

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.460 
lot of design weren't going into these
pieces

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.100 

so<00:06:45.100> within<00:06:45.310> each<00:06:45.490> decal<00:06:45.940> set<00:06:46.270> it'll<00:06:46.870> be<00:06:46.990> the

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
so within each decal set it'll be the

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.220 
so within each decal set it'll be the
physical<00:06:47.470> decals<00:06:48.040> it's<00:06:48.900> basically<00:06:49.900> like<00:06:50.080> an

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
physical decals it's basically like an

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.940 
physical decals it's basically like an
ink<00:06:50.380> transfer<00:06:50.800> kind<00:06:51.010> of<00:06:51.100> system<00:06:51.540> there's<00:06:52.540> also

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
ink transfer kind of system there's also

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.830 
ink transfer kind of system there's also
usually<00:06:53.950> a<00:06:54.190> masking<00:06:54.670> component<00:06:55.270> so<00:06:55.690> there

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
usually a masking component so there

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.660 
usually a masking component so there
will<00:06:55.930> be<00:06:55.960> multiple<00:06:56.290> paint<00:06:56.830> colors<00:06:57.220> that<00:06:57.520> go

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
will be multiple paint colors that go

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.600 
will be multiple paint colors that go
into<00:06:57.850> each<00:06:58.090> of<00:06:58.300> these<00:06:58.390> bikes<00:06:58.720> and<00:06:59.460> many<00:07:00.460> of

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
into each of these bikes and many of

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.300 
into each of these bikes and many of
those<00:07:00.730> colors<00:07:01.150> will<00:07:01.330> take<00:07:01.510> multiple<00:07:01.750> coats<00:07:02.350> so

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
those colors will take multiple coats so

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.390 
those colors will take multiple coats so
within<00:07:03.730> each<00:07:03.910> art<00:07:04.180> set<00:07:04.510> is<00:07:04.900> a<00:07:05.380> masking<00:07:06.040> set<00:07:06.310> to

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
within each art set is a masking set to

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.980 
within each art set is a masking set to
control<00:07:06.790> where<00:07:07.030> the<00:07:07.180> paint<00:07:07.390> transitions

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
control where the paint transitions

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.080 
control where the paint transitions
happen<00:07:08.230> by<00:07:08.680> size<00:07:08.980> as<00:07:09.670> well<00:07:09.940> as<00:07:10.030> a

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
happen by size as well as a

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.390 
happen by size as well as a
corresponding<00:07:10.780> decal<00:07:11.290> set<00:07:11.650> that<00:07:11.950> matches<00:07:12.130> up

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
corresponding decal set that matches up

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.850 
corresponding decal set that matches up
to<00:07:12.580> all<00:07:12.910> the<00:07:13.060> masking<00:07:13.540> so<00:07:14.470> it's<00:07:14.620> a<00:07:14.680> pretty

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
to all the masking so it's a pretty

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.920 
to all the masking so it's a pretty
complicated<00:07:16.290> graphic<00:07:17.290> setup
