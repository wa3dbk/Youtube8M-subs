00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
lettuces lettuce so that's not going to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
lettuces lettuce so that's not going to
be<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> problem<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> same<00:01:53.310> we've

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
be a problem it also is the same we've

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.679 
be a problem it also is the same we've
saved<00:01:54.270> our<00:01:54.450> own<00:01:54.540> seed<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
saved our own seed from this is a

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.090 
saved our own seed from this is a
Yugoslavian<00:01:57.689> red<00:01:57.869> butter<00:01:58.079> crunch<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
Yugoslavian red butter crunch which is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
Yugoslavian red butter crunch which is
really<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.790> nice<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.420> rosettes

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

of<00:02:01.500> lettuce<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.240> saved<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:03.719> last

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
of lettuce and we saved them from last

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
of lettuce and we saved them from last
year<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.590> let<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> few<00:02:04.950> bolt<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
year we just let a few bolt and go to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
year we just let a few bolt and go to
seed<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.140> had<00:02:07.890> plenty<00:02:08.190> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
seed and then we just had plenty of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.760 
seed and then we just had plenty of
lettuce<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.629> also<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.020> let<00:02:10.200> us<00:02:10.229> late<00:02:10.619> in

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
lettuce you can also so let us late in

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
November

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.360 
November
and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.290> they'll<00:02:12.470> sprout<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.040> then<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.250> can

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and then they'll sprout and then you can

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.790 
and then they'll sprout and then you can
overwinter<00:02:13.730> um<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.230> depends<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.650> where

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
overwinter um so but it depends on where

for this time of year I like to do it in
a<00:02:50.300> nice<00:02:50.480> small<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.620> know<00:02:51.820> row<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.090> i<00:02:53.150> can

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
a nice small you know row so i can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760 
a nice small you know row so i can
transplant<00:02:53.840> them<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.410> spread<00:02:54.650> them

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770

out<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.980> where<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.130> need<00:02:55.310> them<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.459> be<00:02:55.670> okay

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
out to where I need them to be okay

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.680 
out to where I need them to be okay
especially<00:02:57.380> with<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.620> heat<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> we're<00:02:59.660> just

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
especially with the heat so we're just

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.809 
especially with the heat so we're just
going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> take<00:03:00.290> them<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.420> sprinkle<00:03:02.420> them<00:03:02.450> in

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.750 

and<00:03:07.180> they're<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.629> get<00:03:07.810> kind<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.140> dense

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and they're going to get kind of dense

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.179
