nobody<00:00:09.309> is<00:00:09.429> on<00:00:09.610> Simon<00:00:10.150> with<00:00:10.269> the<00:00:10.389> key<00:00:10.660> case

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
nobody is on Simon with the key case

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.140 
nobody is on Simon with the key case
from<00:00:11.169> Kensington<00:00:11.559> it<00:00:11.919> is<00:00:12.009> a<00:00:12.039> tongue<00:00:12.700> twister

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
from Kensington it is a tongue twister

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.730 
from Kensington it is a tongue twister
for<00:00:13.179> sure<00:00:13.509> what<00:00:13.749> this<00:00:13.869> thing<00:00:13.929> is<00:00:14.139> though<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:14.709> a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
for sure what this thing is though is a

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.000 
for sure what this thing is though is a
keyboard<00:00:15.249> in<00:00:15.490> case<00:00:15.730> for<00:00:15.999> the<00:00:16.090> iPad<00:00:16.449> Mini

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
keyboard in case for the iPad Mini

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.439 
keyboard in case for the iPad Mini
all-in-one<00:00:18.010> and<00:00:18.279> it<00:00:18.400> is<00:00:18.519> very<00:00:18.849> tiny<00:00:19.150> as<00:00:19.359> you

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
all-in-one and it is very tiny as you

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.509 
all-in-one and it is very tiny as you
can<00:00:19.570> see<00:00:19.779> in<00:00:19.900> my<00:00:20.019> hands<00:00:20.259> here<00:00:20.500> it<00:00:21.009> is<00:00:21.160> not<00:00:21.279> very

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
can see in my hands here it is not very

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.089 
can see in my hands here it is not very
big<00:00:21.730> it's<00:00:21.849> about<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.240> same<00:00:22.449> length<00:00:23.349> as<00:00:23.589> a<00:00:23.710> iPad

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
big it's about the same length as a iPad

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.320 
big it's about the same length as a iPad
Mini<00:00:24.310> actually<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:24.849> that<00:00:24.939> makes<00:00:25.089> a<00:00:25.179> lot<00:00:25.300> of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
Mini actually and that makes a lot of

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.150 
Mini actually and that makes a lot of
sense<00:00:25.570> because<00:00:25.720> you<00:00:26.080> put<00:00:26.259> your<00:00:26.380> iPad<00:00:26.679> Mini<00:00:26.949> on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
sense because you put your iPad Mini on

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.560 
sense because you put your iPad Mini on
top<00:00:27.400> of<00:00:27.550> this<00:00:27.609> thing<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.910> snaps<00:00:28.119> right<00:00:28.269> in<00:00:28.509> and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
top of this thing it snaps right in and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.970 
top of this thing it snaps right in and
I'll<00:00:28.689> show<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.900> how<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.019> works<00:00:29.320> in<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.650> second

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
I'll show you how that works in a second

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.190 
I'll show you how that works in a second
but<00:00:30.640> this<00:00:30.759> is<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:30.999> keyboard<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.599> am<00:00:31.720> NOT<00:00:31.900> crazy

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
but this is the keyboard I am NOT crazy

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.650 
but this is the keyboard I am NOT crazy
about<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.800> at<00:00:32.920> all<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.399> is<00:00:33.550> very<00:00:33.660> constraining

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
about it at all it is very constraining

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.479 
about it at all it is very constraining
partly<00:00:35.469> because<00:00:35.649> there's<00:00:36.070> these<00:00:36.250> little

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
partly because there's these little

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.490 
partly because there's these little
walls<00:00:36.940> up<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.480> side<00:00:37.719> here<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.230> uses

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
walls up on the side here that it uses

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.229 
walls up on the side here that it uses
for<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.770> case<00:00:38.949> function<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.579> you<00:00:40.000> really

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
for the case function and you really

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.819 
for the case function and you really
can't<00:00:40.539> stretch<00:00:40.870> your<00:00:41.050> fingers<00:00:41.379> out<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:41.770> you

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
can't stretch your fingers out so you

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.439 
can't stretch your fingers out so you
often<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.610> know<00:00:42.699> you<00:00:43.000> feel<00:00:43.149> like<00:00:43.270> you're

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
often you know you feel like you're

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.970 
often you know you feel like you're
you're<00:00:43.840> kind<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.199> bunched<00:00:44.530> up<00:00:44.649> on<00:00:44.829> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
you're kind of bunched up on the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.290 
you're kind of bunched up on the
keyboard<00:00:45.399> here<00:00:45.460> it's<00:00:45.760> really<00:00:46.000> not<00:00:46.149> a<00:00:46.210> very

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
keyboard here it's really not a very

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.090 
keyboard here it's really not a very
comfortable<00:00:46.870> typing<00:00:47.079> surface<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.680> begin<00:00:47.800> with

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
comfortable typing surface to begin with

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.340 
comfortable typing surface to begin with
most<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.030> keys<00:00:49.239> are<00:00:49.449> about<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.870> same<00:00:50.050> size

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
most of the keys are about the same size

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.990 
most of the keys are about the same size
so<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:50.739> hard<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:50.920> figure<00:00:51.100> out<00:00:51.280> exactly<00:00:51.820> which

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
so it's hard to figure out exactly which

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.369 
so it's hard to figure out exactly which
key<00:00:52.239> you're<00:00:52.390> hitting<00:00:52.660> because<00:00:52.960> everything

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
key you're hitting because everything

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.470 
key you're hitting because everything
feels<00:00:53.530> about<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:54.010> same<00:00:54.219> I'm<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.940> touched<00:00:55.239> hyper

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
feels about the same I'm a touched hyper

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.750 
feels about the same I'm a touched hyper
and<00:00:55.719> I<00:00:55.780> have<00:00:55.930> been<00:00:56.109> for<00:00:56.289> a<00:00:56.320> very<00:00:56.379> long<00:00:56.590> time<00:00:57.010> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
and I have been for a very long time and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.639 
and I have been for a very long time and
this<00:00:58.059> thing<00:00:58.269> just<00:00:58.300> isn't<00:00:58.870> working<00:00:59.050> for<00:00:59.230> me<00:00:59.440> I'm

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
this thing just isn't working for me I'm

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.169 
this thing just isn't working for me I'm
just<00:00:59.679> really<00:00:59.980> having<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.219> hard<00:01:00.399> time<00:01:00.429> typing<00:01:00.879> on

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
just really having a hard time typing on

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.970 
just really having a hard time typing on
it<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.780> other<00:01:01.899> problem<00:01:02.230> I<00:01:02.289> had<00:01:02.469> was<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.679> when

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
it the other problem I had was that when

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.460 
it the other problem I had was that when
you<00:01:03.070> get<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.519> there<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:05.199> know<00:01:05.320> an

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
you get it there is a you know an

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.140 
you get it there is a you know an
instruction<00:01:06.009> page<00:01:06.280> here<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.850> sheet<00:01:07.030> of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
instruction page here just a sheet of

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.289 
instruction page here just a sheet of
paper<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.890> QR<00:01:09.369> code<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.970> get<00:01:10.180> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
paper and the this QR code to get the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.240 
paper and the this QR code to get the
manual<00:01:10.570> didn't<00:01:10.960> work<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.860> reason<00:01:12.009> why<00:01:12.220> I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
manual didn't work and the reason why I

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.010 
manual didn't work and the reason why I
was<00:01:12.400> trying<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.759> go<00:01:12.939> there<00:01:13.150> was<00:01:13.330> because<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.720> was

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
was trying to go there was because I was

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.810 
was trying to go there was because I was
trying<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.380> pair<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.799> keyboard<00:01:15.189> up<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.670> the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
trying to pair the keyboard up with the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.999 
trying to pair the keyboard up with the
iPad<00:01:16.509> Mini<00:01:16.750> here<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.290> my<00:01:17.500> friend<00:01:17.770> just

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
iPad Mini here that my friend just

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.830 
iPad Mini here that my friend just
didn't<00:01:18.189> let<00:01:18.280> me<00:01:18.430> for<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:18.850> review<00:01:19.180> thank<00:01:19.720> you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
didn't let me for this review thank you

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.109 
didn't let me for this review thank you
Justin<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.799> when<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:20.950> hit<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.159> pair<00:01:21.850> button

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
Justin and when I hit the pair button

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.399 
Justin and when I hit the pair button
here<00:01:22.240> nothing<00:01:22.540> happened<00:01:22.900> it<00:01:22.960> turns<00:01:23.140> out<00:01:23.290> you

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
here nothing happened it turns out you

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.810 
here nothing happened it turns out you
have<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.619> hit<00:01:23.740> function<00:01:23.979> pair<00:01:24.400> but<00:01:24.549> they<00:01:24.670> could

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
have to hit function pair but they could

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.640 
have to hit function pair but they could
have<00:01:24.909> put<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.600> on<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.110> paper<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.560> would

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
have put that on the paper that would

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.990 
have put that on the paper that would
have<00:01:26.770> made<00:01:26.920> life<00:01:27.100> easier<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.520> if<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.790> buy<00:01:27.939> this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
have made life easier so if you buy this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.969 
have made life easier so if you buy this

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
thing know that is that what you will

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.130 
thing know that is that what you will
have<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.159> do<00:01:30.460> however<00:01:31.329> once<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:31.990> get

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
have to do however once you do get

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.899 
have to do however once you do get
everything<00:01:32.500> working<00:01:32.710> properly<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.460> does<00:01:33.640> pair

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
everything working properly it does pair

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.300 
everything working properly it does pair
up<00:01:34.090> very<00:01:34.420> quickly<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:35.740> we'll<00:01:35.920> do<00:01:36.040> here<00:01:36.250> is

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
up very quickly so what we'll do here is

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.100 
up very quickly so what we'll do here is
all<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.640> kind<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.970> flick<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.570> switch<00:01:37.810> here

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
all this kind of flick the switch here

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.170 
all this kind of flick the switch here
and<00:01:38.350> we'll<00:01:38.500> take<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.220> look<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.670> corner<00:01:39.939> with

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
and we'll take a look in the corner with

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.760 
and we'll take a look in the corner with
that<00:01:40.360> little<00:01:40.509> Bluetooth<00:01:40.810> thing<00:01:41.229> lights<00:01:41.439> up<00:01:41.619> it

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
that little Bluetooth thing lights up it

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.469 
that little Bluetooth thing lights up it
pretty<00:01:41.979> much<00:01:42.100> comes<00:01:42.399> up<00:01:42.610> immediately<00:01:42.909> so

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
pretty much comes up immediately so

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.810 
pretty much comes up immediately so
there<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.960> goes<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.070> are<00:01:45.189> paired<00:01:45.490> up<00:01:45.610> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
there it goes and we are paired up and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.030 
there it goes and we are paired up and
ready<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.030> go<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.509> I'm<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.290> gonna<00:01:47.380> pop<00:01:47.680> into

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
ready to go so I'm just gonna pop into

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.100 
ready to go so I'm just gonna pop into
our<00:01:48.430> notepad<00:01:49.180> here<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.930> little

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
our notepad here and I have a little

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.289 
our notepad here and I have a little
instruction<00:01:50.649> myself<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.310> start<00:01:51.579> typing<00:01:52.000> so

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
instruction myself to start typing so

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.530 
instruction myself to start typing so
I'm<00:01:52.930> gonna<00:01:53.310> disposition<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.520> normally<00:01:55.360> just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
I'm gonna disposition this normally just

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.469 
I'm gonna disposition this normally just
so<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.369> I'm<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.640> having<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.909> hard<00:01:58.030> time<00:01:58.149> as

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
so and I'm just having a hard time as

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.670 
so and I'm just having a hard time as
you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.659> see<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.020> didn't<00:01:59.229> get<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.439> shift

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
you can see like I didn't get the shift

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.889 
you can see like I didn't get the shift
right<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.130> gets<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.759> just<00:02:01.240> hard<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.509> type<00:02:01.750> and

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
right it gets it's just hard to type and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.090 
right it gets it's just hard to type and
I<00:02:01.930> really<00:02:02.140> can't<00:02:02.350> type<00:02:02.530> quickly<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.070> it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
I really can't type quickly on it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.770 
I really can't type quickly on it
however<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.789> need<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.969> keyboard<00:02:04.240> for<00:02:04.659> your

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
however if you need a keyboard for your

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.319 
however if you need a keyboard for your
iPad<00:02:05.049> Mini<00:02:05.289> this<00:02:05.500> will<00:02:05.649> certainly<00:02:06.060> suffice<00:02:07.060> I

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
iPad Mini this will certainly suffice I

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.840 
iPad Mini this will certainly suffice I
did<00:02:07.539> like<00:02:07.750> however<00:02:07.960> how<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:09.190> case<00:02:09.400> function

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
did like however how the case function

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.060 
did like however how the case function
works<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.170> do<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.650> kind<00:02:11.920> of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
works so what you do is you just kind of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.830 
works so what you do is you just kind of
put<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.150> this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
put it in this

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.369 
put it in this
down<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.739> then<00:02:15.069> snap<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.150> place<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.900> it

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
down and then snap it in place and it

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.320 
down and then snap it in place and it
makes<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> pretty<00:02:18.069> nice<00:02:18.280> snapping<00:02:18.819> sound<00:02:19.090> when

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
makes a pretty nice snapping sound when

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.759 
makes a pretty nice snapping sound when
it<00:02:19.420> goes<00:02:19.599> in<00:02:19.870> most<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.410> time<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.739> a

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
it goes in most of the time it's a

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.170 
it goes in most of the time it's a
little<00:02:20.980> hard<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.280> get<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.550> in<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:21.849> initially

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
little hard to get it in there initially

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.240 
little hard to get it in there initially
after<00:02:22.269> breaking<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.870> think<00:02:22.930> but<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.980> snaps

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
after breaking in I think but it snaps

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.160 
after breaking in I think but it snaps
in<00:02:24.489> really<00:02:24.910> securely<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.690> makes<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.989> nice

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
in really securely and it makes a nice

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.050 
in really securely and it makes a nice
protective<00:02:27.040> cover<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.550> screen<00:02:27.819> there<00:02:27.970> is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
protective cover for the screen there is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.089 
protective cover for the screen there is
nothing<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:28.450> gonna<00:02:28.599> get<00:02:28.900> through<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.950> I

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
nothing that's gonna get through this I

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.500 
nothing that's gonna get through this I
think<00:02:30.129> this<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.549> aluminum<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.120> feels<00:02:31.299> like

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
think this is aluminum it feels like

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.740 
think this is aluminum it feels like
it's<00:02:31.660> metal<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.799> do<00:02:33.069> like<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.519> feel<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.629> is

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
it's metal so I do like that feel it is

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.390 
it's metal so I do like that feel it is
a<00:02:34.780> little<00:02:34.959> hard<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.440> get<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.769> iPad<00:02:36.160> out

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
a little hard to get the iPad out

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.979 
a little hard to get the iPad out
however<00:02:36.819> because<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.299> goes<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.629> really

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
however because it goes in really

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.780 
however because it goes in really
securely<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.099> is<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.459> trying<00:02:39.549> not<00:02:39.730> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
securely and it is I'm trying not to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.490 
securely and it is I'm trying not to
break<00:02:40.000> Justin's<00:02:40.390> iPad<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> process<00:02:41.290> here

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
break Justin's iPad in the process here

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.350 
break Justin's iPad in the process here
as<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.709> get<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.150> not

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
as I get it out as you can see it is not

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.589 
as I get it out as you can see it is not
easy<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.860> see<00:02:44.880> relinquished<00:02:45.880> control<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.329> your

easy to see relinquished control of your

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.539 
easy to see relinquished control of your
iPad<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> keyboard<00:02:47.799> case<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.069> then<00:02:48.430> if

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
iPad to the keyboard case and then if

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.979 
iPad to the keyboard case and then if
once<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.120> though<00:02:49.299> easy<00:02:49.480> slide<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.959> right

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
once you do though easy slide it right

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.080 
once you do though easy slide it right
in<00:02:50.230> there<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.860> mean<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.220> could<00:02:51.370> see<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
in there so I mean I could see this you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.150 
in there so I mean I could see this you
know<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.239> tight<00:02:52.480> grip<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.900> has<00:02:53.079> on<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.500> might

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
know this tight grip it has on it might

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.500 
know this tight grip it has on it might
make<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.489> difficult<00:02:54.519> when<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.239> trying<00:02:55.390> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
make it difficult when you're trying to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.640 
make it difficult when you're trying to
take<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:55.870> quickly<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.319> might<00:02:56.440> end<00:02:56.590> up

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
take it out quickly you might end up

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.199 
take it out quickly you might end up
tossing<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.370> iPad<00:02:57.760> around<00:02:57.880> cuz<00:02:58.120> you're

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
tossing the iPad around cuz you're

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.539 
tossing the iPad around cuz you're
putting<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.599> much<00:02:58.720> force<00:02:59.049> in<00:02:59.290> to<00:03:00.010> open<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> up

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
putting so much force in to open it up

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.759 
putting so much force in to open it up
now<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.000> good<00:03:01.239> thing<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.230> when<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.590> do

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
now the good thing is that when you do

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.589 
now the good thing is that when you do
have<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.129> mounted<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.610> there<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:04.329> are<00:03:04.360> these

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
have it mounted in there there are these

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.539 
have it mounted in there there are these
little<00:03:04.840> protective<00:03:05.379> feet<00:03:05.680> inside<00:03:06.069> here<00:03:06.370> so

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
little protective feet inside here so

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.789 
little protective feet inside here so
it's<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:06.970> cushion<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.989> glass<00:03:08.200> bezel<00:03:08.709> so

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
it's going to cushion the glass bezel so

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's going to cushion the glass bezel so
you're<00:03:08.890> not<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.190> get<00:03:09.310> any<00:03:09.489> scratches<00:03:10.030> or

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
you're not going to get any scratches or

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.059 
you're not going to get any scratches or
anything<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.019> will<00:03:11.140> keep<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
anything like that and it will keep the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.979 
anything like that and it will keep the
surface<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.940> screen<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.780> keyboard

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
surface of the screen off the keyboard

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.780 
surface of the screen off the keyboard
so<00:03:14.440> you're<00:03:14.590> not<00:03:14.709> going<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.069> have<00:03:15.250> like<00:03:15.519> those

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
so you're not going to have like those

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.770 
so you're not going to have like those
little<00:03:16.440> dust<00:03:18.030> imprints<00:03:19.030> from<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.389> keyboard

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
little dust imprints from the keyboard

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.449 
little dust imprints from the keyboard
and<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.769> side<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and that and that on that side of the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.849 
and that and that on that side of the
screen<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.690> overall<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> think<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.500> it's

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
screen so so overall I think it's it's

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.710 
screen so so overall I think it's it's
okay<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.250> mean<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> certainly<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> keyboard

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
okay I mean it certainly is a keyboard

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.059 
okay I mean it certainly is a keyboard
and<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.959> works<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.440> it's<00:03:26.560> functional<00:03:26.980> it

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
and it works and it's functional it

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.610 
and it works and it's functional it

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
about the keyboard the keyboarding

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.420 
about the keyboard the keyboarding
comfort<00:03:32.410> at<00:03:32.500> least<00:03:32.650> for<00:03:32.829> me<00:03:32.920> maybe<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.250> size

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
comfort at least for me maybe the size

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.830 
comfort at least for me maybe the size
of<00:03:33.579> my<00:03:33.670> hands<00:03:33.880> are<00:03:34.000> an<00:03:34.120> issue<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.389> mean<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.690> might

work<00:03:34.989> great<00:03:35.349> for<00:03:35.530> someone<00:03:35.709> with<00:03:35.859> smaller

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
work great for someone with smaller

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.370 
work great for someone with smaller
hands<00:03:36.370> certainly<00:03:37.299> kids<00:03:37.780> would<00:03:37.930> certainly<00:03:38.170> do

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
hands certainly kids would certainly do

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.410 
hands certainly kids would certainly do
better<00:03:38.620> with<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.950> than<00:03:39.069> I<00:03:39.160> will<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:40.120> Bluetooth

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
better with it than I will the Bluetooth

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.849 
better with it than I will the Bluetooth
does<00:03:40.630> pair<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:40.959> very<00:03:41.170> nicely<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.680> case

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
does pair up very nicely the case

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.339 
does pair up very nicely the case
function<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.730> very<00:03:43.000> secure<00:03:43.389> however

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349
