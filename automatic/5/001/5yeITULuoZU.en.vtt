DB IC helical and the 10 DB IC crosshair
one<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.449> greatest<00:00:26.960> things<00:00:27.259> about<00:00:27.470> fpv<00:00:28.339> is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
one of the greatest things about fpv is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.730 
one of the greatest things about fpv is
you<00:00:28.730> can<00:00:28.880> change<00:00:29.179> your<00:00:29.480> experience<00:00:29.839> simply<00:00:30.619> by

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
you can change your experience simply by

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.740 
you can change your experience simply by
changing<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.339> receiver<00:00:31.669> antenna<00:00:32.240> and<00:00:32.480> it

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
changing the receiver antenna and it

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.080 
changing the receiver antenna and it
makes<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.140> biggest<00:00:33.470> difference<00:00:34.090> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
makes the biggest difference the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.180 
makes the biggest difference the
difference<00:00:35.510> between<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:36.170> mile<00:00:36.530> or<00:00:36.710> two<00:00:36.740> around

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
difference between a mile or two around

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.700 
difference between a mile or two around
the<00:00:37.370> park<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.850> 20<00:00:38.510> or<00:00:38.600> 30<00:00:38.900> miles<00:00:39.230> over<00:00:39.500> the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
the park and 20 or 30 miles over the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.070 
the park and 20 or 30 miles over the
horizon<00:00:40.190> mountain<00:00:40.520> surfing<00:00:40.940> is<00:00:41.090> all<00:00:41.300> in<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
horizon mountain surfing is all in the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.530 
horizon mountain surfing is all in the
receiver<00:00:42.470> antenna<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:43.850> probably<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.360> most

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
receiver antenna it's probably the most

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.750 
receiver antenna it's probably the most
important<00:00:45.290> part<00:00:45.560> so<00:00:45.950> be<00:00:46.100> sure<00:00:46.130> to<00:00:46.280> choose<00:00:46.580> it

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
important part so be sure to choose it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.790 
important part so be sure to choose it
wisely

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
wisely

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.770 
wisely
so<00:00:48.800> these<00:00:49.370> are<00:00:49.580> some<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.790> my<00:00:49.910> more<00:00:50.150> common<00:00:50.600> ones

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
so these are some of my more common ones

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.430 
so these are some of my more common ones
that<00:00:50.900> fit<00:00:51.380> just<00:00:51.650> about<00:00:51.800> every<00:00:52.340> pilot<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.440> which

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
that fit just about every pilot so which

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.510 
that fit just about every pilot so which
one<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.830> you<00:00:54.860> choose

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
one do you choose

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.660 
one do you choose
well<00:00:56.090> here<00:00:56.630> are<00:00:56.660> three<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:57.200> my<00:00:57.380> more<00:00:57.560> popular

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
well here are three of my more popular

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.970 
well here are three of my more popular
antennas<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:58.700> fit<00:00:59.150> just<00:00:59.180> about<00:00:59.930> any<00:01:00.230> pilot

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
antennas that fit just about any pilot

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.100 
antennas that fit just about any pilot
out<00:01:01.190> there<00:01:01.580> except<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.420> guys<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.630> fly<00:01:03.080> a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
out there except for the guys that fly a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.039 
out there except for the guys that fly a
really<00:01:03.890> extreme<00:01:04.519> range<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.269> 40<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.720> 50

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
really extreme range in the 40 and 50

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.330 
really extreme range in the 40 and 50
mile<00:01:06.259> range<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.040> first<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.530> 7.5<00:01:09.530> DB<00:01:09.950> IC

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
mile range the first is the 7.5 DB IC

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.640 
mile range the first is the 7.5 DB IC
helical<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.750> great<00:01:12.050> thing<00:01:12.290> about<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
helical the great thing about the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.100 
helical the great thing about the
helical<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:14.030> antenna<00:01:14.660> will<00:01:14.810> give<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.050> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
helical is this antenna will give you a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.170 
helical is this antenna will give you a
little<00:01:15.410> bit<00:01:15.590> more<00:01:15.860> than<00:01:16.160> twice<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.940> range

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
little bit more than twice the range

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.600 
little bit more than twice the range
than<00:01:17.690> your<00:01:17.840> standard<00:01:18.080> on<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.980> antenna<00:01:19.310> such

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
than your standard on the antenna such

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.310 
than your standard on the antenna such
as<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.820> cloverleaf<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:20.540> skew<00:01:20.780> planer<00:01:21.020> wheel

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
as the cloverleaf or skew planer wheel

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.050 
as the cloverleaf or skew planer wheel
but<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.830> other<00:01:22.190> thing<00:01:22.580> that's<00:01:22.730> great<00:01:22.940> about

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
but the other thing that's great about

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.480 
but the other thing that's great about
having<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.659> directional<00:01:24.230> antenna<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:25.250> thing

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
having a directional antenna this thing

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.480 
having a directional antenna this thing
has<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> beam<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.360> hundred<00:01:26.600> 50°<00:01:27.280> but<00:01:28.280> if<00:01:28.370> you

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
has a beam of a hundred 50° but if you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.000 
has a beam of a hundred 50° but if you
fly<00:01:28.760> behind<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.570> or<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:29.960> sides<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.560> still

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
fly behind it or to the sides it still

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.190 
fly behind it or to the sides it still
picks<00:01:31.340> up<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.610> signal<00:01:32.030> fairly<00:01:32.630> well<00:01:32.870> it

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
picks up the signal fairly well it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.290 
picks up the signal fairly well it
doesn't<00:01:33.590> punish<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:34.430> getting<00:01:34.700> behind<00:01:34.850> it

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
doesn't punish you for getting behind it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.210 
doesn't punish you for getting behind it
so<00:01:35.510> it<00:01:35.600> makes<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.930> an<00:01:36.050> excellent<00:01:36.560> beginners

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
so it makes it an excellent beginners

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.370 
so it makes it an excellent beginners
antenna<00:01:37.670> here's<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.450> other<00:01:38.570> advantage<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.350> it

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
antenna here's the other advantage to it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.920 
antenna here's the other advantage to it
what's<00:01:40.159> called<00:01:40.370> front<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.729> back<00:01:40.909> ratio<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
what's called front to back ratio the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.410 
what's called front to back ratio the
helical<00:01:42.470> listens<00:01:43.070> out<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.670> front<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.180> lot

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
helical listens out in front a lot

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.170 
helical listens out in front a lot
better<00:01:44.750> than<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.050> does<00:01:45.229> behind<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.550> singles

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
better than it does behind so singles

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.570 
better than it does behind so singles
that<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.479> find<00:01:47.810> around<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.250> thing

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
that you find around you this thing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.250 
that you find around you this thing
doesn't<00:01:49.909> pick<00:01:50.150> them<00:01:50.299> up<00:01:50.450> unless<00:01:50.720> they're

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
doesn't pick them up unless they're

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.510 
doesn't pick them up unless they're
right<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.710> there<00:01:51.740> or<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.100> airplanes

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
right out there or the airplanes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.800 
right out there or the airplanes
transmitting<00:01:53.150> which<00:01:53.240> means<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.600> have<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.720> much

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
transmitting which means you have a much

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.350 
transmitting which means you have a much
cleaner<00:01:54.320> video<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> directional<00:01:56.060> antenna

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
cleaner video with a directional antenna

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
cleaner video with a directional antenna
as<00:01:56.840> opposed<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.920> an<00:01:58.310> omni<00:01:59.030> antenna<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.780> you

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
as opposed to an omni antenna and you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.899 
as opposed to an omni antenna and you
get<00:02:00.560> double<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.890> range<00:02:01.190> if<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.640> want<00:02:01.850> a

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
get double the range if you want a
