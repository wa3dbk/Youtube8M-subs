bolt you'll see this little gasket on
there<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> float<00:00:26.189> bar<00:00:26.460> would<00:00:26.640> pull<00:00:27.000> off

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
there and float bar would pull off

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.839 
there and float bar would pull off
careful<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> knock<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.310> needle<00:00:29.760> out

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
inside the float Bowl sometimes you can

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.190 
inside the float Bowl sometimes you can
get<00:00:38.940> away<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> washing<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but other times especially if they're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.319 
but other times especially if they're
old<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.170> well<00:00:43.469> worth<00:00:43.940> replacing<00:00:44.940> them

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
old it's well worth replacing them

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
old it's well worth replacing them
completely<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.440> video<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:47.010> am<00:00:47.160> going

to be replacing the float Bowl the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
to be replacing the float Bowl the
gasket<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.719> bolt<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> goes<00:00:52.170> on

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
gasket and the little bolt that goes on

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.119 
gasket and the little bolt that goes on
the<00:00:52.530> bottom<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.170> convenience<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
part number for this float Bowl is 4 9 5

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
part number for this float Bowl is 4 9 5
933<00:00:59.989> now<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> double<00:01:01.710> check<00:01:01.739> before

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
933 now you have to double check before

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
933 now you have to double check before
you<00:01:02.309> buy<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:03.180> engine<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.750> they

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you buy one for your engine because they

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
you buy one for your engine because they
can<00:01:04.110> vary<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.220> part<00:01:05.400> numbers<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.880> be

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
can vary and the part numbers can be

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.590 
can vary and the part numbers can be
different<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.240> ahead<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
different so you can now go ahead and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
different so you can now go ahead and
open<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:09.960> new<00:01:10.229> parts<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> do

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
open up your new parts one thing I do

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250 
open up your new parts one thing I do
recommend<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.180> getting<00:01:12.600> new<00:01:12.720> parts<00:01:13.080> though

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
recommend when getting new parts though

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.280 
recommend when getting new parts though
is<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.710> clear<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.310> work<00:01:14.549> space<00:01:15.450> completely

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is you clear your work space completely

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
is you clear your work space completely
so<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.430> new<00:01:17.880> parts<00:01:18.210> dirty

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so that you don't get new parts dirty

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.390 
so that you don't get new parts dirty
and<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.590> mix<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.130> your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and that you don't mix them up with your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
and that you don't mix them up with your
ones<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.210> you'll<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.930> new<00:01:25.229> float

Bowl
I<00:01:37.939> do<00:01:38.939> sometimes<00:01:39.240> keep<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:39.930> packaging<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I do sometimes keep my packaging for a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
I do sometimes keep my packaging for a
few<00:01:41.369> weeks<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.540> reference<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
few weeks just for reference in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
few weeks just for reference in the
future<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> gasket<00:01:47.820> on

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
future you can then put the gasket on

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.499 
future you can then put the gasket on
the<00:01:48.329> carburetor<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.640> now<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:50.850> sure<00:01:50.909> all

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the carburetor here now make sure all

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.590 
the carburetor here now make sure all
the<00:01:51.780> surfaces<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.799> clean<00:01:53.360> you've<00:01:54.360> washed

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the surfaces are clean you've washed

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.120 
the surfaces are clean you've washed
them<00:01:54.750> properly<00:01:57.469> let's<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.890> carb

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
them properly let's do that with carb

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.330 
them properly let's do that with carb
Queen

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.719 

can<00:02:04.119> be<00:02:04.210> quite<00:02:04.420> fiddly<00:02:04.719> putting<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.200> Gaskell

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
can be quite fiddly putting this Gaskell

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.639 
can be quite fiddly putting this Gaskell
so<00:02:06.729> make<00:02:06.850> sure<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.060> don't<00:02:07.229> crease<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.470> or

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
so make sure you don't crease it or

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.509 
so make sure you don't crease it or
twist<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.789> make<00:02:10.599> sure<00:02:10.630> it's<00:02:10.899> all<00:02:11.130> sat<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.340> there

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
twist it make sure it's all sat in there

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:21.540 
twist it make sure it's all sat in there
properly<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.680> see<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> gasket

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
properly so you can see that the gasket

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.150
