[MediaShout: Working with Script Control Cues]

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.820
One of the things that sets MediaShout
apart from basic church presentation software

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.990
is the ability to add items to your
presentation that perform a function,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.580
rather than just playing a piece of media.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.240
Since this is a relatively unique
concept to many users,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.829
one of the most requested Shout Tips
has been using scripts control cues

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.760
to create announcement loops.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.850
As I just mentioned, MediaShout includes certain
types of cues that don't play media themselves,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.609
but rather perform a function or affect
another cue in your presentation.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.609
So let's look at how script controls
work by building an announcement loop.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.899
First, let's add some announcements to our
presentation.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.170
I'll use the File Deck to find my folder
of announcement graphics.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.969
Now I've already set up a graphic template
called "7 Seconds"

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.350
that includes a 7-second automatic
advance.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.370
So I'll select one of my announcement
graphics,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.680
choose the "7 second" template,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.120
and then select the rest of my
announcement graphics,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.400
and drag them all into my script.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.730
Now the announcement graphics are in my
presentation and already include a

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.970
7 second advance in each of them.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.890
Also, there's one announcement video I'd
like to use in my loop,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.800
however, I don't want it to play as
often as the other announcements.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.770
So I'll drop the video right below the
graphics and make sure it's set to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.550
automatically advance after the video
finishes playing.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.331
Next, I'll use the Elements Deck or the
Insert Menu at the top of my screen to

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.860
add a Script Control Cue to the bottom
of my announcement graphics,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.180
since I want the script control to point back
up to the first graphic and then create a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.180
loop.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.500
Once I drop it into the script, the Cue Editor
automatically pops open and now I can

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.250
choose how I want the script control to
work.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.360
So, let's look at the options we have.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.380
The first option is "Target."

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.250
This is where you select which cue
the script control points to.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.599
We can either choose First Cue, Previous,
Next, Last, or select a specific cue.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.230
So let's choose the First Cue option.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.629
Next, we see a Scheduled Playing checkbox
and Time of Day setting.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.989
Checking this box and selecting a
specific time of day will cause MediaShout

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.590
to automatically play the script
control at a specific time...

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.629
like, 30 minutes before your service
while you're in a production meeting,

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.010
or while you're grabbing that last cup of
coffee.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.879
The next setting we come to is "Play Times."

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.260
This gives us the option of telling the
script control to go back to the first

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.530
cue an infinite number of times,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.439
or to only go back and play the first
cue once or twice before continuing on

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.170
to another point in your script.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.569
I'll set this to "3" and explain why in a
moment.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.959
Finally, the last setting we have is
Advance Target.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.599
Since I've set the script control to
only play 3 times, I have to tell it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.499
where to go once it's finished.

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.870
So I'll go ahead and leave this set to
Next Cue, although I could choose

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.310
any other cue in my presentation.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.680
Next, I'll click OK, and we're almost ready
to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.909
play our announcement loop.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.530
I'll add another script control right below
the video

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.430
that is set to "First Cue as Target,"
and "Loop" for Playtimes.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.279
Now my group of announcements slides
will play 3 times before the video plays,

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.590
and then loop back to the beginning of my
script

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.609
playing the slides 3 times, and so on.

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.629
So, as you can see, script control cues can
be used for creating simple loops,

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.859
or in combination with one another
to create more intricate automation.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.989
Do you have other topics you'd like to
see us cover?

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.469
I'd love to hear from you.
