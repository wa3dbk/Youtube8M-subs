00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
instructions on how to do it so we'll

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.509 
instructions on how to do it so we'll
get<00:00:43.330> them<00:00:43.449> put<00:00:43.720> on<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:44.170> see<00:00:44.769> how<00:00:44.979> it<00:00:45.100> looks

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.549 

well<00:00:48.519> I<00:00:48.549> think<00:00:48.879> I'll<00:00:49.180> first<00:00:49.449> start<00:00:49.570> by<00:00:50.110> putting

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
well I think I'll first start by putting

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.320 
well I think I'll first start by putting
on<00:00:50.799> that<00:00:52.890> trunk<00:00:53.890> net<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.699> that's<00:00:57.970> for

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
on that trunk net for it so that's for

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.229 
on that trunk net for it so that's for
the<00:00:58.960> fusions<00:00:59.559> second<00:01:00.489> cousin<00:01:00.989> lincoln<00:01:01.989> zephyr

so come on just a second well there's
one<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:09.060> figured<00:02:10.060> out<00:02:10.209> with<00:02:10.390> these<00:02:10.539> cargo<00:02:11.020> net

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
one on figured out with these cargo net

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.160 
one on figured out with these cargo net
the<00:02:12.069> hook<00:02:13.170> secures<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> taillight<00:02:16.170> bolts

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the hook secures to the taillight bolts

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.470 
the hook secures to the taillight bolts
itself<00:02:17.770> one<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.490> taillight<00:02:18.880> bolts<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
itself one of the taillight bolts on the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.210 
itself one of the taillight bolts on the
top<00:02:20.190> according<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.400> instruction

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
top according to the instruction

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.060 
top according to the instruction
anyway<00:02:22.700> because<00:02:22.880> I've<00:02:23.180> taken<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.170> liner<00:02:24.440> away

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
anyway because I've taken the liner away

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.210 
anyway because I've taken the liner away
from<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:28.420> light<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.500> bolts<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> has

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
from the light to see what bolts it has

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.680 
from the light to see what bolts it has
and<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:31.700> got<00:02:32.000> three<00:02:32.360> bolts<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:34.630> went<00:02:35.630> up

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and it's got three bolts on it went up

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.100 
and it's got three bolts on it went up
top<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.820> two<00:02:37.820> on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> bottom<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.660> hold<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.990> in

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
top and two on the bottom to hold it in

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.330 
top and two on the bottom to hold it in
place<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.450> use<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.350> top<00:02:42.590> because

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
place so you use the one up top because

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.890 
place so you use the one up top because
then<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> net<00:02:43.790> supposed<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.570> stretched

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
then the net supposed to be stretched

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.890 
then the net supposed to be stretched
out<00:02:46.540> basically<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> whole<00:02:47.810> width<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:49.900> so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
out basically the whole width of that so

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.230 
out basically the whole width of that so
try<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.740> see<00:02:52.160> if<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.550> show<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.880> how<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.060> put

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
try and see if I can show you how to put

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.260 
try and see if I can show you how to put
the<00:02:53.360> second<00:02:53.690> lot<00:02:53.840> on<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.580> don't<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.180> on

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270

where it is now accordingly I felt that

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.990 
where it is now accordingly I felt that
the<00:03:20.570> bolt<00:03:20.750> was<00:03:20.900> right<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.470> area<00:03:22.000> so

about<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.170> big<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.970> bolt<00:03:29.209> should<00:03:29.570> be<00:03:29.750> there

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
that bolt that I got to try and connect

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.350 
that bolt that I got to try and connect
onto<00:05:15.820> with<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.210> clip<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:16.930> let's<00:05:18.180> see<00:05:19.180> if<00:05:19.300> I

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
onto with that clip so let's see if I

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.620 
onto with that clip so let's see if I
can<00:05:19.390> do<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.750> or<00:05:19.960> not<00:05:20.700> okay<00:05:21.700> i'm<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.360> start

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
can do it or not okay i'm going to start

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:33.540 
can do it or not okay i'm going to start
threading<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.230> now<00:05:30.540> well<00:05:32.130> take<00:05:33.130> with<00:05:33.310> much

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
threading it now well take with much

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:43.920 
threading it now well take with much
difficulty<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:35.040> think<00:05:36.040> it's<00:05:36.220> gone<00:05:42.810> where<00:05:43.810> they

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
difficulty I think it's gone where they

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.480 
difficulty I think it's gone where they
see<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.880> bolt<00:05:46.210> is<00:05:46.450> black<00:05:46.780> now<00:05:50.340> that<00:05:51.340> were

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.450 
see that bolt is black now that were
used<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:52.030> be<00:05:52.530> now<00:05:53.530> covered<00:05:53.890> with<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.220> plastic

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
used to be now covered with that plastic
