original genius CP helicopter landing

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.620 
original genius CP helicopter landing
gear<00:00:22.750> which<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.710> wrote<00:00:24.520> very<00:00:24.760> easily<00:00:25.030> from<00:00:25.420> the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
gear which I wrote very easily from the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.189 
gear which I wrote very easily from the
from<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.230> helicopter<00:00:27.030> but<00:00:28.030> more<00:00:28.750> important

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
from the helicopter but more important

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.819 
from the helicopter but more important
is<00:00:29.320> that<00:00:29.350> that<00:00:29.680> stuck<00:00:30.610> landing<00:00:31.480> gear<00:00:31.930> of<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
is that that stuck landing gear of the

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.310 
is that that stuck landing gear of the
genius<00:00:33.039> CP<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:37.090> integral<00:00:37.570> part<00:00:37.690> of<00:00:38.200> the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
genius CP is an integral part of the

genius CP is an integral part of the
frame<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:40.540> Kira<00:00:40.750> decided<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.290> make<00:00:41.470> the

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
frame what Kira decided to make the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.710 
frame what Kira decided to make the
frame<00:00:41.880> part<00:00:42.880> of<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.000> landing<00:00:43.329> gear<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.630> so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
frame part of the landing gear and so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.220 
frame part of the landing gear and so
they<00:00:43.840> combine<00:00:44.200> both<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:45.630> when<00:00:46.630> you<00:00:46.720> broke<00:00:46.930> out

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
they combine both and when you broke out

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.680 
they combine both and when you broke out
the<00:00:47.320> landing<00:00:47.620> gears<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> case<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:49.540> my

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
case in many cases out there I was stuck

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.270 
case in many cases out there I was stuck

near<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.229> control<00:01:48.830> board<00:01:49.009> you'll<00:01:49.789> see<00:01:50.000> that

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
near the control board you'll see that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.149 
near the control board you'll see that
later<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.050> video<00:01:51.229> when<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:51.560> take<00:01:51.979> this

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
later on in this video when we take this

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.149 
later on in this video when we take this
canopy<00:01:53.119> apart<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.050> we<00:01:54.170> show<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.649> innards<00:01:55.130> of

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
canopy apart and we show the innards of

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.660 
canopy apart and we show the innards of
the<00:01:55.550> helicopter<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> difference

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the helicopter so that's the difference

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.570 
the helicopter so that's the difference
between<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.179> genie<00:01:59.360> ACP<00:01:59.920> lending<00:02:00.920> your<00:02:01.100> frame

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
between the genie ACP lending your frame

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.940 
between the genie ACP lending your frame
support<00:02:02.000> versus<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.630> blade<00:02:02.840> mcpx<00:02:03.289> but

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
support versus the blade mcpx but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.590 
support versus the blade mcpx but
everything<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.340> else<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:05.000> pretty<00:02:05.149> much<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
everything is else is pretty much the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.410 
everything is else is pretty much the
same<00:02:05.810> same<00:02:06.649> idea<00:02:06.950> same<00:02:07.280> installation<00:02:07.940> and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
same same idea same installation and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.280 
same same idea same installation and
same<00:02:08.739> application<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> hope<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.720> this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
same application so I hope that this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.590 
same application so I hope that this
video<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.620> useful<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.340> more<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:13.940> more<00:02:14.390> than

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
video is useful and more more more than

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.699 
video is useful and more more more than
anything<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.049> kid<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.380> we're<00:02:15.530> providing

helicopter I I really like the genius CP
is<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.519> reasons<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.030> had<00:02:26.299> discussed

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
is for the reasons that I had discussed

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.199 
is for the reasons that I had discussed
earlier<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.350> another<00:02:27.890> video<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.459> did<00:02:28.549> when

earlier in another video that I did when

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.750 
earlier in another video that I did when
the<00:02:29.329> first<00:02:29.769> when<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.860> helicopter<00:02:31.040> first<00:02:31.579> came

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the first when the helicopter first came

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.910 
the first when the helicopter first came
out<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.810> did<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:32.989> also<00:02:33.290> did<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> comparison

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
out and I did I also did a comparison

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.900 
out and I did I also did a comparison
with<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.430> helicopter<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.120> blade<00:02:36.110> mcpx<00:02:36.910> both

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
with this helicopter and blade mcpx both

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.490 
with this helicopter and blade mcpx both
of<00:02:38.060> them<00:02:38.150> share<00:02:38.390> very<00:02:38.600> similar<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:39.170> close

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
of them share very similar in close

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.130 
of them share very similar in close
similarities<00:02:40.160> although<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> genius<00:02:41.630> CP<00:02:41.750> does

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
similarities although the genius CP does

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.370 
similarities although the genius CP does
have<00:02:42.380> what<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> thought<00:02:43.459> at<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> time<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:44.380> little

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
have what I thought at the time a little

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.800 
have what I thought at the time a little
better<00:02:48.430> stabilization<00:02:49.430> system<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.239> opposed

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
better stabilization system as opposed

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.000 
better stabilization system as opposed
to<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.109> blade<00:02:51.560> mcpx<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.930> liked<00:02:54.709> them<00:02:54.859> both

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
to the blade mcpx but I liked them both

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.509 
to the blade mcpx but I liked them both
in<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.310> mere<00:02:58.519> microfiber<00:02:59.030> combo

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
in in with with a mere microfiber combo

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.300 
in in with with a mere microfiber combo
kits<00:03:01.519> they're<00:03:02.359> even<00:03:02.870> better<00:03:02.989> helicopters<00:03:03.739> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
kits they're even better helicopters and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.680 
kits they're even better helicopters and
I<00:03:04.430> think<00:03:04.670> those<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.359> have<00:03:05.510> bought

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
I think those of you that have bought

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.620 
I think those of you that have bought
the<00:03:05.959> mcpx<00:03:06.680> combo<00:03:07.100> kits<00:03:07.310> from<00:03:07.820> us<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.269> have

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
the mcpx combo kits from us and have

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.099 
the mcpx combo kits from us and have
used<00:03:09.590> those<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:09.980> your<00:03:10.100> blade<00:03:10.459> mcpx<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.329> also

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
used those on your blade mcpx and also

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.830 
used those on your blade mcpx and also
have<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.350> blade<00:03:12.590> also<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.730> genius<00:03:14.000> CP

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
have this blade also have this genius CP

helicopter you will see a
you<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:19.150> understand<00:03:19.630> where<00:03:19.840> those<00:03:19.960> benefits

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
you you understand where those benefits

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.840 
you you understand where those benefits
come<00:03:20.890> from<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.860> know<00:03:23.980> most<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.730> those

come from and you know most of those

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.130 
come from and you know most of those
problems<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.390> are<00:03:25.510> out<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:25.660> with<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
problems that are out there with the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.200 
problems that are out there with the
stock<00:03:26.350> products<00:03:26.740> just<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.490> go<00:03:27.610> away<00:03:27.730> with<00:03:28.180> a

one supports etc so basically that's the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.150 
one supports etc so basically that's the
reason<00:03:36.430> why<00:03:36.460> we<00:03:36.760> did<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.330> uh<00:03:37.390> this

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
reason why we did this uh this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.220 
reason why we did this uh this
particular<00:03:39.160> kit<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:41.380> as<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.340> said<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:43.230> hope

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
video I hope that it totally totally

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.450 
video I hope that it totally totally
takes<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.480> helicopter<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.140> new<00:04:02.350> level<00:04:02.560> it's

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
takes the helicopter to a new level it's

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.550 
takes the helicopter to a new level it's
a<00:04:03.550> more<00:04:03.730> robust<00:04:04.120> it's<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.080> more<00:04:05.260> appealing

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
a more robust it's a more appealing

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.550 
a more robust it's a more appealing
level<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.510> performance<00:04:07.510> wise<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.990> don't<00:04:08.380> think

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
level and performance wise I don't think

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.660 
level and performance wise I don't think
you're<00:04:08.620> going<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.860> lose<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.100> performance

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
you're going to lose the performance

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.700 
you're going to lose the performance
that<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.630> stunt<00:04:10.870> performance<00:04:11.350> because<00:04:11.590> these

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
that the stunt performance because these

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that the stunt performance because these
parts<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.100> likely<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.850> begin<00:04:13.210> with<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:14.730> you

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
parts are likely to begin with and you

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.420 
parts are likely to begin with and you
should<00:04:15.940> be<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.420> should<00:04:16.450> be<00:04:16.660> fine<00:04:17.160> with<00:04:18.160> stuck

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
should be you should be fine with stuck

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.979 
should be you should be fine with stuck
product<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.239> have<00:04:19.390> retrofitted

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
product and if you have retrofitted

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.080 
product and if you have retrofitted
you're<00:04:20.380> stuck<00:04:20.650> product<00:04:21.040> with<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> cordless<00:04:21.820> or

you're stuck product with a cordless or
brushless<00:04:22.860> motors<00:04:23.860> that's<00:04:24.490> even<00:04:24.760> better

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
brushless motors that's even better

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.000 
brushless motors that's even better
because<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.420> gives<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:26.170> lot<00:04:26.620> more<00:04:26.680> power
