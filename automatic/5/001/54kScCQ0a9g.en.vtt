00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.240
 recently in china the television of that country presented a video 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.360
 d supposedly two solbes 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 Throughout the internet there was a great discussion 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.479
 it really seems to me a visual effect 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.659
 however I have received there were also other videos 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.599
 where more clearly you can see these 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.349
 2 soles 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.670
 today that he presented to you some of the images that we have received 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.360
 you have the last word I really do not know the logic tells me that 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.080
 that's impossible 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.750
 What is it about 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 So on March 2, 2011 one of the most watched newscasts in China 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.630
 He informed his viewers about the presence in heaven of what 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.890
 we could consider the sighting of two suns as we can see in these 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.430
 images and that immediately caused various reactions in the world 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.480
 it was a phenomenon that could be seen by hundreds of witnesses 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 information ran like wildfire that caught the attention of society that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.040
 did not accommodate what his eyes saw 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 in the first instance we have this material that the witness managed to capture 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.950
 where we see the sun and one side of this author object of equal one AIDS and that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.860
 it had the same size one of them diffused ina orange and the other theron 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.440
 light yellow sphere appearing 1 slightly above the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 other 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.119
 in the lower part of the Moscow take that is the marq and in the part 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.770
 top we see some clouds that have a gray color with a tonality 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.630
 reddish how we can appreciate it for July 26, 2010 the inhabitants of the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.789
 Province of Sich province want from China saw at 20 o'clock to 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.179
 these three luminous objects or less buildings the witnesses declared that 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.759
 they were like three suns a phenomenon as it is said that lasted about 10 minutes 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.799
 then move slowly from the south to the north of the building 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.120
 and at the same time the diameter became smaller and smaller until 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.460
 disappeared a month later that is on May 16, 2009 at 17:44 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.750
 and according to some data released on the internet it is stated that it was a 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.430
 sighting recorded in India and that his witness managed to capture with a 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.740
 cell phone we see the sun in the first instance has the disque arba 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.760
 a small light object we noticed that the moment the camera moves the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.910
 object close to the sun remains in the same place the witness makes approach 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.810
 they are away from your cell phone as points of reference we have trees like this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.330
 also in 2009 in devon england 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.430
 these two suns were videotaped 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.000
 at the top of the shot we see that this our sun at sunset without 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 however on the lower right side there is a second of smaller size the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.980
 light intensity as a reference point we have some trees that are 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.810
 the foreground, some researchers say that these 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.740
 videos are part of an optical refraction or that it is an effect that 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.740
 it is produced by various changes in the atmosphere of the earth 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.780
 but nevertheless 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.250
 So far, no hard evidence has been presented to demonstrate 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.489
 such a situation 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.849
 we can consider 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.269
 that really be two suns in the sky 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.020
 or that reflexes are discussed to video cameras or cell phones 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.340
 or on the other hand why not think that intelligence messages are discussed 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.959
 higher
