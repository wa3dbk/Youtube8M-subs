this<00:00:20.250> company<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:23.480> main

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this company is because of one main

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.920 
this company is because of one main
point<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.800> charging<00:00:26.640> port<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.390> cutout

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
point it's this charging port a cutout

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.429 
point it's this charging port a cutout
for<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> charging<00:00:28.650> port<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> many<00:00:31.109> companies

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
for the charging port so many companies

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
for the charging port so many companies
have<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.920> same<00:00:32.340> exact<00:00:32.790> model<00:00:33.300> i<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
have the same exact model i think that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.520 
have the same exact model i think that
fool<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.380> something<00:00:35.329> which<00:00:36.329> don't<00:00:37.320> have

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
fool you or something which don't have

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.080 
fool you or something which don't have
the<00:00:37.800> charging<00:00:38.370> ports<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.760> will<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the charging ports you will have to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
the charging ports you will have to
actually<00:00:39.210> charge<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> transformer<00:00:40.440> with

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
actually charge you a transformer with

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
actually charge you a transformer with
your<00:00:41.430> case<00:00:41.790> open<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> i<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.530> don't<00:00:43.710> like

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
your case open and i really don't like

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.400 
your case open and i really don't like
that<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.190> i<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.550> ipad<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.410> an

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that because i have an ipad which has an

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
that because i have an ipad which has an
open<00:00:46.739> charging<00:00:47.719> cut<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.850> charging<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:50.969> i

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
open charging cut out for charging so i

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
open charging cut out for charging so i
cannot<00:00:51.270> leave<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.780> open<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.300> that's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
cannot leave it just open so that's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
cannot leave it just open so that's
reason<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.629> ordered<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.410> let's<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.890> how

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
reason i ordered this so let's see how

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.750 
reason i ordered this so let's see how
this<00:00:56.250> fits<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.829> transformer<00:00:59.390> right<00:01:01.760> there's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this fits the transformer right there's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
this fits the transformer right there's
some<00:01:02.879> instructions<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.809> nice<00:01:04.589> i<00:01:04.949> saw

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
some instructions right here nice i saw

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.469 
some instructions right here nice i saw
a<00:01:05.400> video<00:01:05.610> online<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:06.990> follow<00:01:07.400> that

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
a video online and this one follow that

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.760 
a video online and this one follow that
simple<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:11.790> four

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
simple so you just use these four

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.620 
simple so you just use these four
latches<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:15.140> push<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.640> transformer<00:01:17.640> end

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.590 

it<00:01:21.630> fits<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.380> tight<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.119> these<00:01:24.119> these

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it fits really tight and these these

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
it fits really tight and these these
think<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.320> latches<00:01:25.619> i<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.070> they<00:01:26.159> are

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
think these latches i think they are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.910 
think these latches i think they are
supported<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.270> metal<00:01:29.659> frame

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
supported with some kind of metal frame

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.230 
supported with some kind of metal frame
friends<00:01:31.920> inside<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.400> probably<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
friends inside so probably and that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890 
friends inside so probably and that
makes<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:33.960> strong<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:36.509> part<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
makes it really strong and this part you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
makes it really strong and this part you
just<00:01:36.990> push<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.180> right<00:01:39.530> okay

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
just push it in all right okay

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
just push it in all right okay
close<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.400> there's<00:01:44.400> more<00:01:45.320> support

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
close this and there's more support

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.040 
close this and there's more support
latch<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.400> thing<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:48.120> just<00:01:48.870> press<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
latch kind of thing here just press it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.080 
latch kind of thing here just press it
can<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.229> how<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.619> 10<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.700> i

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
can you see how up 10 that is and i

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.390 
can you see how up 10 that is and i
really<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.720> part<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.619> don't

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
really like this part because i don't

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.980 
really like this part because i don't
want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.729> add<00:01:56.940> lot<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.330> bulk<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> my

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
want to really add lot of bulk to my

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
want to really add lot of bulk to my
epad<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:02.280> way<00:02:02.610> thinner<00:02:03.450> than

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
epad so i think this is way thinner than

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.010 
epad so i think this is way thinner than
my<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.259> pancakes<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:07.610> all<00:02:08.610> right<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.840> like

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
my I pancakes so all right I really like

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.520 
my I pancakes so all right I really like
this<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> let<00:02:11.489> me<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.760> open<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:15.320> they<00:02:16.320> have<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
this so let me just open it they have a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.530 
this so let me just open it they have a
cutout<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.489> camera<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.209> know<00:02:18.270> how

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
cutout for the camera I don't know how

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.000 
cutout for the camera I don't know how
you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> camera<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.650> your<00:02:19.769> case

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you can use the camera with your case

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.930 
you can use the camera with your case
closed<00:02:20.400> or<00:02:20.820> maybe<00:02:21.660> there's<00:02:24.440> three<00:02:25.440> when<00:02:25.940> you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
closed or maybe there's three when you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.820 
closed or maybe there's three when you
would<00:02:27.239> go<00:02:27.390> use<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.750> camera<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.410> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
would go use your camera like that so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.160 
would go use your camera like that so
you<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> cut<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.910> there<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you have to have a cut out there that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.080 
you have to have a cut out there that
was<00:02:31.260> lame<00:02:32.209> there<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.989> charging<00:02:34.350> port<00:02:34.940> cut<00:02:35.940> out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
was lame there the charging port cut out

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.990 
was lame there the charging port cut out
you<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.410> ports<00:02:37.709> open<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.910> have

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you have all your ports open you have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.020 
you have all your ports open you have
the<00:02:39.120> speaker's<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:40.940> okay<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> let's<00:02:44.880> see

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the speaker's here okay and so let's see

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.270 
the speaker's here okay and so let's see
how<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.239> three-stage<00:02:47.989> Stan<00:02:48.989> works<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.220> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
how the three-stage Stan works so you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.150 
how the three-stage Stan works so you
