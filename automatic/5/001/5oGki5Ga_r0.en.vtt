00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
because I had actually considered doing

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
because I had actually considered doing
that<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.350> thing<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.680> really

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
that because this thing was really

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.330 
that because this thing was really
difficult<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> take<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:28.130> with<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
difficult to take out but with the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.220 
difficult to take out but with the
magical<00:00:29.929> tool<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.189> screwdriver<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:33.230> was

magical tool use of a screwdriver I was

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
magical tool use of a screwdriver I was
able<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:35.309> pop<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.059> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
able to actually pop it out so it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.049 
able to actually pop it out so it's
actually<00:00:36.480> loose<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.840> now<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> other

into things she didn't ask for we're
going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> cut<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.570> nice<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.440> simply<00:02:47.710> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
going to cut this out nice and simply I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.080 
going to cut this out nice and simply I
could<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:48.400> my<00:02:48.580> knife<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.000> actually

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
could use my knife but I'm actually

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.450 
could use my knife but I'm actually
going<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.450> use<00:02:49.540> my<00:02:49.660> scissors<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.380> stuff<00:02:51.280> is

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
going to use my scissors this stuff is

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.320 
going to use my scissors this stuff is
so<00:02:51.760> easy<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.240> work<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.700> said<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
so easy to work with like I said this is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.840 
so easy to work with like I said this is
set<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.530> as<00:02:56.800> soft<00:02:57.130> as<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.790> be

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
set this is as soft as it's going to be

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.760 
set this is as soft as it's going to be
and<00:02:58.240> as<00:02:58.360> hard<00:02:58.630> as<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:58.990> going<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.530> rest

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
and as hard as it's going to be the rest

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.040 
and as hard as it's going to be the rest
of<00:03:00.070> its<00:03:00.340> life

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:16.150 

I'm<00:03:09.050> just<00:03:09.260> cutting<00:03:09.500> out<00:03:09.710> my<00:03:09.740> circle<00:03:14.860> let's<00:03:15.860> see

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
I'm just cutting out my circle let's see

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.280 
I'm just cutting out my circle let's see
if<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.430> fits

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
if it fits

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.340 
if it fits
hey<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.500> pretty<00:03:18.770> good<00:03:18.920> fit<00:03:19.870> kind<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.080> flat

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
hey it's pretty good fit kind of flat

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.010 
hey it's pretty good fit kind of flat
not<00:03:22.160> round<00:03:22.430> like<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> head<00:03:22.940> but<00:03:23.360> she's<00:03:23.780> going<00:03:23.960> to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
not round like a head but she's going to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.800 
not round like a head but she's going to
have<00:03:24.170> hair<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.710> anyway<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:26.090> actually

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
have hair in it anyway and I actually

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.690 
have hair in it anyway and I actually
reroute<00:03:27.290> really<00:03:27.800> thick<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:30.200> um<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.950> don't

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
reroute really thick so it's um I don't

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.880 
reroute really thick so it's um I don't
think<00:03:31.880> it's<00:03:32.000> going<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> be<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.330> problem<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:33.020> don't

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
think it's going to be a problem I don't

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.000 
think it's going to be a problem I don't
think<00:03:34.040> anyone's<00:03:34.340> going<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.580> notice<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.910> it's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
think anyone's going to notice that it's

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.170 
think anyone's going to notice that it's
flat<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:41.270> trim<00:03:42.050> some<00:03:42.080> edges<00:03:42.590> here<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.820> fits

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
flat and trim some edges here so it fits

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.600 
flat and trim some edges here so it fits
in<00:03:47.300> there<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.780> little<00:03:48.050> bit<00:03:48.200> better

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.410 

and<00:03:55.570> now<00:03:56.380> all<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.680> really<00:03:57.040> have<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.400> do<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:58.060> glue

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
and now all I really have to do is glue

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.630 
and now all I really have to do is glue
it<00:03:58.600> into<00:03:58.750> place<00:03:59.020> but<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.260> think<00:03:59.650> what<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.830> want<00:04:00.310> to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
it into place but I think what I want to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.640 
it into place but I think what I want to
do<00:04:00.820> is<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.920> think<00:04:03.310> I'm<00:04:03.580> going<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.880> actually

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
do is I think I'm going to actually

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.480 
do is I think I'm going to actually
reroute<00:04:05.650> her<00:04:07.560> reroute<00:04:08.560> everything<00:04:08.710> set<00:04:09.280> this

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
reroute her reroute everything set this

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.420 
reroute her reroute everything set this
and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.930> before<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.710> do<00:04:11.770> that<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.280> going<00:04:12.400> to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and then before I do that I'm going to

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.010 
and then before I do that I'm going to
make<00:04:12.550> sure<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.730> draw<00:04:12.970> my<00:04:13.180> guide<00:04:13.360> lines<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.720> always

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
make sure I draw my guide lines I always

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.330 
make sure I draw my guide lines I always
draw<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.230> guide<00:04:14.410> lines<00:04:14.650> when<00:04:14.860> I'm<00:04:14.950> rerouting

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
draw a guide lines when I'm rerouting

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.640 
draw a guide lines when I'm rerouting
into<00:04:15.790> something<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.450> doesn't<00:04:17.320> currently

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
into something that doesn't currently

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.930 
into something that doesn't currently
have<00:04:17.859> guidelines<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.769> will<00:04:21.310> probably<00:04:21.519> draw

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
have guidelines so I will probably draw

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.970 
have guidelines so I will probably draw
in<00:04:22.060> my<00:04:22.150> guide<00:04:22.330> lines<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.680> then

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
in my guide lines on this and then

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.470 
in my guide lines on this and then
actually<00:04:24.280> route<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.610> separately<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.180> glue<00:04:25.420> it

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
actually route it separately and glue it

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.370 
actually route it separately and glue it
into<00:04:25.660> place<00:04:26.340> after<00:04:27.340> routing<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.660> think

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
into place after routing it I think

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.550 
into place after routing it I think
that's<00:04:29.590> what<00:04:29.740> I'm<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.190> do<00:04:31.170> for<00:04:32.170> an<00:04:32.230> idea

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
that's what I'm going to do for an idea

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.400 
that's what I'm going to do for an idea
of<00:04:33.330> how<00:04:34.330> Sakai<00:04:34.750> reroute<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:36.870> how<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.900> reroute

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
of how Sakai reroute and how I reroute

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.920 
of how Sakai reroute and how I reroute
something<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:38.950> doesn't<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.400> guidelines

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
something that doesn't have guidelines

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
you're routing in brand-new holes and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.010 
you're routing in brand-new holes and
not<00:05:14.260> manufactured<00:05:15.250> holes<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:16.419> sticks<00:05:16.750> really

colors I ordered and then I ordered
another<00:05:38.650> color<00:05:39.450> but<00:05:40.450> here<00:05:41.169> between<00:05:41.530> her<00:05:41.830> two

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
another color but here between her two

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.490 
another color but here between her two
manufactured<00:05:42.850> rows<00:05:43.690> of<00:05:43.900> hair<00:05:44.140> I<00:05:44.169> actually

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
manufactured rows of hair I actually

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.150 
manufactured rows of hair I actually
have<00:05:45.180> four<00:05:46.180> more<00:05:46.510> rows<00:05:46.690> four<00:05:47.290> four<00:05:47.770> more<00:05:47.979> rows

and I've been a big advocate for the

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.950 
and I've been a big advocate for the
Lumina<00:06:16.620> polymer<00:06:17.610> clay<00:06:17.790> since<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.390> ordered<00:06:18.600> it

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
Lumina polymer clay since I ordered it

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.260 
Lumina polymer clay since I ordered it
for<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.770> first<00:06:19.980> time<00:06:20.220> I<00:06:20.250> think<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.820> ordered<00:06:21.150> it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
for the first time I think I ordered it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.720 
for the first time I think I ordered it
over<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.660> summer<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.130> I've<00:06:23.130> used<00:06:23.280> it<00:06:23.430> a<00:06:23.550> lot

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
over the summer and I've used it a lot

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.430 
over the summer and I've used it a lot
of<00:06:23.850> little<00:06:24.060> tiny<00:06:24.300> projects<00:06:24.930> I've<00:06:25.080> used<00:06:25.260> it<00:06:25.380> in

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
of little tiny projects I've used it in

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.950 
of little tiny projects I've used it in
some<00:06:25.590> jewelry<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:27.240> just<00:06:27.660> think<00:06:27.810> it's

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
some jewelry and I just think it's

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.540 
some jewelry and I just think it's
overall<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.410> rather<00:06:28.650> useful<00:06:29.100> product

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
overall a rather useful product

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.670 
overall a rather useful product
