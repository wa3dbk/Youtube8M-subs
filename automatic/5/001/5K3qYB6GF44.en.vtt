00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 if georg is in his workshop 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.860
 he forgets everything around him 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.080
 because if the artisan out 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.540
 waltenhofen a new idea for one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.450
 he must have sculpture or something similar 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.310
 Immediately put into action even if that 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.630
 means that for days in his 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.630
 workshop disappears 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 makes music and bothered billions for it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.960
 is or what is allowed there is nothing more important 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.050
 that since the mainfranken and hectic 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.749
 is always important something and then there is 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 again weeks probably nothing more 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:59.159
 mitmacher cargo is with langcker for 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.530
 his works the artist works with 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.650
 the most diverse materials of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.900
 wood over metal to natural stone the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.720
 passion for sculpture became 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.080
 Menig almost put in the cradle like 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.680
 small village in lower Franconia where so 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.260
 the sculpture and the stonemason 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.190
 European work with stones for a long time 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.440
 So tradition has changed in this phase 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.380
 about it for example Franconian flights 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.570
 playing time from kirchheim so just 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.440
 five kilometers from where I am 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.050
 born 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.020
 you have landed it own but mine 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.250
 neighbor the rub burkhard was the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 sculptor masters and apprentices 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 I trained at eighteen 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.820
 said human they come to you in the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.550
 teach and learn that also normal said 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.620
 are you stupid or what do you want there 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 learn what someone can teach 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.750
 Keep it up and you make capital 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.880
 See what comes out of it is here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.620
 So far, not only have come out 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 the most diverse sculptures 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.110
 but also historical weapons and up 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 for example, this Roman crossbow 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.730
 the artist had to be built 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 research a lot because the weapons 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.170
 should be as true to the original as possible 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.430
 be and of course work well 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.480
 if you do something like that today mazztv.de 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 It used to be so that at least products 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.300
 what do they have for consideration 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 had possibilities and for tools 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.530
 and so on and there have been worth it 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.500
 that you can try that as well 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:46.030
 earlier the possibility capo and easy 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.880
 So it's with that hour in there 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.350
 comes something together 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.510
 many working hours have georg menig 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.030
 also in his small private exhibition 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.549
 proudly presented here is his 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 recent works and could probably 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.930
 not be different 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860
 u 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.019
 the works are still with the artist 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 even he prefers to do it like that 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.870
 as soon as possible the public 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.970
 make available 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.739
 but that is something natural 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.670
 ultimately decide 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.239
 it now 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.110
 the art market will decide whether the air 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.180
 this is because if this is something you 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.540
 what behaves or what you need and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.019
 museums will decide for their part 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.730
 it is for us as the section should there 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.049
 stop is actually as always that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.329
 let happen to me a great 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.989
 speculated some pious of the current- 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.190
 and thankful in victors invincible 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.440
 unbending 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.690
 georg publishes under this name 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.819
 his works and who the artist 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.840
 getting to know one understands how aptly 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.840
 this title is
