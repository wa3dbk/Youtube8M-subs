00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.260
 goo 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.600
 me 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.830
 me 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.360
 cm 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.650
 Dubbo 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.650
 me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.880
 In this video, I will study about the name of the note 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.110
 It is g that you use with emoticons, etc. It is g that you can not fail this w. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.940
 Yes 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:35.130
 If this is a person who is aiming for a difficult university, I think it is okay to know 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:39.630
 I think the importance is low, but please remember if you have the ability 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.940
 Immediately we will see it is in the Tteyuu Omeda district Sanjo = 1 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.810
 Or if it is factorized by this, it is ok, so xg o + x +1 = 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.860
 0 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.860
 But it was imaginary solution of 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.100
 Massage x3 on -1 It is meeting of this zero 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.000
 I thing was a few times today 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 Well it is such a thing 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.560
 Specifically, Omega is one- half plus minus route 3 love 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.380
 Will be 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.380
 It is ok no matter which side you set 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:21.820
 Yes, there are quite a few different laws . 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.950
 Of course as a feature x3 on -1 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 Because it is the answer of = 0, it means that it will become a city if it is industrial 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 Then the sound maker is to Kyoto if circumstances 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.010
 You're going to be conjugated 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.030
 There is also a law that returns to the original if there is a conjugated thing 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.640
 Since then 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.310
 Because it is also the answer of x-shaped + x + 1 = 0 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 Because it is also a sea 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:00.439
 It means that omega + rice will be minus 1 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.570
 Is it okay if it deforms? Is it the rice or circumstances + ridge = 1 = 0? 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.450
 Transparent cover circumstances + Omega 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 It is to say + 1 = 0 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.000
 It is that this kind of inconvenient relationship 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 I say wrote of x3 on the = city it is when the well is I Well last put together but 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:26.770
 One and four people are in a situation of alliance, so Deca-Chome Blacksmith Town is Omega's agreement 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.770
 It means that you are fit without clothes 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.980
 Well it's yeah so my eyes are 3 minutes -1 / route 3i 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 In this case, such a calculation will stop soon 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.890
 First of all, if it is said that I should calculate this 6 オ メ ガ of this Omega If I calculate this one by one 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 It's very much 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.459
 But because Omega's misery is one 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.319
 If I think that Omega 6 Article = Omega 3 Article 2 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.980
 I'm gonna have to say in Datte 1 city 2-cho measure in Madokaya 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:07.370
 Then this is the second number I made for this book 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:10.400
 Omega 's 4573 嬢 + Omega 's 2192 or more 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.630
 If you calculate Ikoiko, you're almost going crazy. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.870
 However 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.810
 It is if you use the Tteyuu 1 thirty subsequent three Articles 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.780
 First, the front side of the 4573 riding the I mean is 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:30.290
 Article 33 1524 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:36.709
 It 's like this because there is more than one omega one omega one 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:39.610
 730 top of so much people you were second in the industry is the Tteyuu 2192 is generous calling on 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:45.400
 It is that the ridge of multiplying say Datte ground 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.989
 Yes I bone in medication is the flame and such Yakushi consciousness and I'll be replaced by the city at the summit 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.390
 It means that Omega + ridge will feel like the situation 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:58.310
 In addition 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.310
 It is -1 It is said that such a convenient calculation can be done 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:08.410
 Last but not least King A little navigation for people who know the complex plane as a supplement 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.890
 I will comment 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:18.970
 I'm x3 plants = city imaginary solution of Tteyuu Omeka 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:24.520
 So it means that it is divided equally on the basis of the real position on the complex plane 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.090
 So because the complex plane on a You're yes Omegan say this is to be in this kind of position 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.500
 It is to say 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 x3 on the city = The answer is three of this pink 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.830
 6 the fact that it is two on the left side of the child other than the position of the real number which corresponds to the omega 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.830
 is 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:51.450
 First of all I think is that there was this conjugate complex relationship 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.450
 It's about the x axis, so it's just in symmetrical position . 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:05.130
 What if the square It is a case from the I 3 or more is it 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:07.110
 I think at this diameter formula I and his second wife 120 who I imaginary solutions Are You the left side of the Omega 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.970
 Plus love sign 120 degrees 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.249
 Or, at the bottom side No it will be 240 degrees of 240 degrees plus love sign of cos 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.309
 so 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:18.419
 Yes I can go from here either 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:22.389
 I'm 240 if more than those of the first 120 degrees 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:27.729
 122 times because it should be doubled 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:33.940
 If you go up to 240 degrees , it will be 4 180 degrees for the older brother to go to 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:37.090
 If you pull 360, it means that it is just the opposite vote by saying 120 degrees 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:43.450
 120 degrees will be 240 degrees if two lines 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:46.110
 245 it in the complex is the go just today Once you have humanity in the fact that become 120 degrees 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.110
 It is 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:57.030
 Well five issue is I'm're after last we 嚶鳴is the situation 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:06:02.600
 It became -1 . This is the income considered by these two vectors when checked on the complex number plane 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:06.850
 Since etc. is good, combined it is that you are making finally go here 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.850
 I mean it is -1 because it is yes 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.940
 If you have the extra power, you know about Omega as far as you know 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:18.830
 I think it is okay to know 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.830
 Yes it's about reading
