 I bring you the review of the new 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.219
 Minecraft version that just came out 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.159
 a few days ago that is version 1.8 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.770
 It brings many novelties so let's 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.290
 see what is new that this 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.810
 version first let's start here 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.850
 through the doors as you can see already 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.370
 we have different types of doors already 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.950
 we do not have the same boring door of 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.200
 we always start with this one that we have 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.270
 the acacia door that's a new 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 door that is inserted these 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 doors are made with the different 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.720
 types of wood that we have and here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.880
 we have the jungle gate is the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.739
 birch door that this is wood 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.060
 What I like the most to me is a very 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.660
 very thin clear we have the door of 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.340
 fir and in the oak door he got 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 as you can see now so that we have 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.610
 much more variety in doors and this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.030
 side we have new blocks we have the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.730
 red sandstone we have the red sandstone 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.180
 engraved that it brings as a drawing 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.780
 and smooth red sandstone and we can also 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.290
 make steps of sandstone and slab 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.870
 sandstone and this side has also been 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 added a new place that is a temple 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
 marine and this marine temple inhabit 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 new creatures that we will see them more 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.800
 go ahead and we also have more blocks 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.410
 we have the marine priest block 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.160
 bricks of priest marina marina gray 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.110
 dark and lantern of the sea that these are going 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.720
 to light in the background in the temples 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.120
 so that it is not dark and also here 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 we have new new land 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.160
 here we have granite we have granite 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.910
 polished and now and polished right now 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.520
 sandstone and jade appointment is not on appointment and 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.760
 of if it is polished as you can see these 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600
 they are the new blocks 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.939
 and I also know 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.130
 this block that is of earth was added 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.950
 this block thickens what it is going to do 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.170
 that we are going to put it and it is not going to be 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 will not grow the grass just just 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.510
 it will stay like this so we can put it in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 places where we do not want grass 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.860
 and what has been added has also been added 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.780
 sponge these sponges what yes 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.400
 receive to absorb the water by 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.530
 example if we want to empty somewhere 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.739
 for example here I'm going to put a sponge 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.220
 and see how they suck the water look at everything 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.040
 that pulls water 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 and once it absorbs the water it's going to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 turn into wet sponge for later 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.660
 we can extract that water and something that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.320
 He liked this version of the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.170
 1.8 is the inclusion of this portal 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.150
 armor as you can see here we go 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 we can ride our mature and we put 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.080
 the helmet and we put the breast 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.120
 we put the diamond pants and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.040
 here the drops as you can see already 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 we have a place to accommodate our 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.080
 armor which looks very good and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.010
 also new colors have been added 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.780
 new types to the fences and doors like 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.940
 can see here we have the fences of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 fir we have berries of birch berries 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 jungle dark oak berries and berries 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.090
 acacia 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.150
 As you can see, we have a lot more 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.660
 variety to make our fence for 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.880
 that the animals do not leave and also 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.880
 from this side we can see that we have 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.489
 standard banners that have 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.420
 got into this new version I guess that 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.520
 are to do to distinguish from groups 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.740
 or something like that for new games 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.870
 also here we have already we have 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.850
 iron hatches the list beyond 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.930
 of wood and we can activate them with a 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.739
 button as you can see 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.230
 Here are the new developments in 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.300
 how many blocks in this version and 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.390
 they have also added new mods 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.790
 Now I'm going to show you how you can 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.980
 see here are 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.980
 I'm going to get them out here on this side 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.450
 and as you can see they have made some new 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.050
 monsters mods for our mod for the 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.810
 leander what are these weird things 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.690
 they are called 2 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.690
 Ender half that looks very weird 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:42.740
 there are things left to anyone who came up with 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.529
 we are not going to escape 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.529
 where is it going 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.209
 and they have also added these monsters 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.740
 which are the ones that appear in the temple 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:53.979
 Marine 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.470
 these week guardians that are common 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.470
 like a pufferfish like an eye that makes a 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.150
 medium rare 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.850
 in very rare 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.330
 also like they do not go very well with the 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.460
 fire but well there they are 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.660
 coming out here from the fish tank and they 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.990
 they are also going to hit us and tense and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.750
 two new ones that are here is the the 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.490
 fragment of marine priest and these that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.580
 they are primary crystals because they are 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.580
 to make them for me 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.539
 and as you can see these are the new ones 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.569
 maps that have got into our version 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:42.569
 and they have also added 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.849
 the rabbit as you can see here bunnies 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.849
 you can have many with success here 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.630
 many bunnies bunnies bunnies with 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.550
 these and a new pet is needed 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.460

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.750

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:06.520

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.690
 now here 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.860
 more talk about conventionality 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.360
 and if you can return our pets 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.360
 we can also reproduce them and 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.460
 make our box of bunnies the 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.000
 which will also give us a lot of meat 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.100
 rabbit 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.430
 we can also extract their meat 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.449
 maybe it escapes escapes the escape is 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.419
 bastard who is 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.759

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.240
 look there is the new rabbit meat 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:46.159

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.650
 and also another novelty in this version 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:52.339
 is that now the sheep apart from giving us 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.939

 can see now they release a wool and a 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:05.319
 meat which is very good in case we 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.319
 more food is needed 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.510
