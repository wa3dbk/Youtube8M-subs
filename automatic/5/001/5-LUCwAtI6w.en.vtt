think that are mad this week actually

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.100 
think that are mad this week actually
last<00:05:23.640> week<00:05:23.910> for<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.180> ballroom<00:05:24.570> but<00:05:24.720> he<00:05:24.900> hit<00:05:25.080> a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
last week for the ballroom but he hit a

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.710 
last week for the ballroom but he hit a
new<00:05:25.410> level<00:05:25.680> yeah<00:05:26.340> which<00:05:26.790> makes<00:05:27.270> him<00:05:27.510> more

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
new level yeah which makes him more

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.590 
new level yeah which makes him more
confident<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.650> she<00:05:28.980> dances<00:05:29.850> better<00:05:30.150> and

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
confident and she dances better and

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.380 
confident and she dances better and
which<00:05:31.440> helps<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:32.070> dance<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.700> think<00:05:33.000> all<00:05:33.330> of

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
which helps the dance and I think all of

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.560 
which helps the dance and I think all of
that<00:05:33.570> kind<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.140> combined<00:05:34.560> together<00:05:34.830> makes<00:05:35.310> a

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
that kind of combined together makes a

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.030 
that kind of combined together makes a
good<00:05:36.570> performance<00:05:37.260> I've<00:05:37.500> watched<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.890> lot<00:05:37.919> of
