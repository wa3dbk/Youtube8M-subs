who are I'm a farmer what am I going to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.990 
who are I'm a farmer what am I going to
put<00:00:13.970> on<00:00:14.180> my<00:00:14.360> crops<00:00:14.720> well

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.270 
put on my crops well
okay<00:00:16.330> well<00:00:16.780> I'm<00:00:17.020> going<00:00:17.230> to<00:00:17.290> put<00:00:17.470> fertilizer<00:00:17.740> on

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
okay well I'm going to put fertilizer on

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.830 
okay well I'm going to put fertilizer on
them<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.670> that<00:00:18.760> fertilizer<00:00:19.360> contains

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
them and that fertilizer contains

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.760 
them and that fertilizer contains
nitrogen<00:00:20.230> and<00:00:21.720> phosphorus<00:00:22.720> p<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.560> potassium

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
nitrogen and phosphorus p and potassium

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.660 
nitrogen and phosphorus p and potassium
k<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.060> those<00:00:25.420> three<00:00:25.810> elements<00:00:26.050> are<00:00:26.670> essential

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
k and those three elements are essential

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.749 
k and those three elements are essential
for<00:00:27.880> healthy<00:00:28.360> plant<00:00:28.960> growth<00:00:29.349> now<00:00:30.040> I<00:00:30.070> put<00:00:30.580> my

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
for healthy plant growth now I put my

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.750 
for healthy plant growth now I put my
fertilizer<00:00:31.330> on<00:00:31.570> my<00:00:31.810> crops<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.770> increase<00:00:33.340> crop

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
fertilizer on my crops to increase crop

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.270 
fertilizer on my crops to increase crop
yield<00:00:34.150> I<00:00:34.360> want<00:00:34.570> as<00:00:34.660> much<00:00:34.960> crops<00:00:35.559> as<00:00:35.739> many<00:00:35.949> crops

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
yield I want as much crops as many crops

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.390 
yield I want as much crops as many crops
as<00:00:36.489> possible<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:37.500> generally<00:00:38.500> in<00:00:38.739> society<00:00:39.280> we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
as possible and generally in society we

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.850 
as possible and generally in society we
want<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.790> with<00:00:39.970> an<00:00:40.059> increasing<00:00:40.860> human

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
want that with an increasing human

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.650 
want that with an increasing human
population<00:00:42.550> we're<00:00:42.730> gonna<00:00:42.850> need<00:00:43.030> as<00:00:43.210> much<00:00:43.390> food

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
population we're gonna need as much food

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.040 
population we're gonna need as much food
as<00:00:43.870> possible<00:00:43.900> so<00:00:44.710> fertilizer<00:00:45.340> on<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:46.540> note

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
as possible so fertilizer on that note

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.470 
as possible so fertilizer on that note
is<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.350> good<00:00:47.710> idea<00:00:48.160> one<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:48.969> problems<00:00:49.420> with

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
is a good idea one of the problems with

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.630 
is a good idea one of the problems with
fertilizers<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:50.680> if<00:00:50.800> we<00:00:50.829> use<00:00:51.219> them<00:00:51.430> too

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
fertilizers is that if we use them too

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.880 
fertilizers is that if we use them too
much<00:00:51.850> they<00:00:52.120> can<00:00:52.540> cause<00:00:52.780> pollution<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.710> they

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
much they can cause pollution and they

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.020 
much they can cause pollution and they
can<00:00:54.070> cause<00:00:54.309> something<00:00:54.790> called

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
can cause something called

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090 
can cause something called
eutrophication<00:00:55.840> which<00:00:56.559> we're<00:00:56.739> going<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.950> look

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
eutrophication which we're going to look

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
eutrophication which we're going to look
at<00:00:57.280> next

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 

so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.329> about<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.810> form<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so you need to know about a form of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
so you need to know about a form of
pollution<00:01:07.649> called<00:01:08.220> eutrophication<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
pollution called eutrophication and it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.190 
pollution called eutrophication and it
goes<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.880> I'm<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> farmer<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
goes something like this I'm a farmer so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.639 
goes something like this I'm a farmer so
I<00:01:13.229> put<00:01:13.649> fertilizer<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:15.330> field<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.290> help<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
I put fertilizer on my field to help the

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.639 
I put fertilizer on my field to help the
cross<00:01:16.950> grow<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.539> fertilizer<00:01:19.140> contains

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
cross grow and that fertilizer contains

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.700 
cross grow and that fertilizer contains
phosphates<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.640> nitrates<00:01:21.350> but<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
phosphates and nitrates but when it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.450 
phosphates and nitrates but when it
rains<00:01:23.039> all<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> fertilizer<00:01:24.330> washes<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.530> into

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
rains all the fertilizer washes off into

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.919 
rains all the fertilizer washes off into
rivers<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> ends<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:28.890> ponds

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
rivers and then it ends up down in ponds

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.350 
rivers and then it ends up down in ponds
now<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:30.990> fertilizer<00:01:31.710> helps<00:01:32.399> algae<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.330> grow

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
now the fertilizer helps algae to grow

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.949 
now the fertilizer helps algae to grow
so<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.500> plant<00:01:35.009> called<00:01:35.220> algae<00:01:35.970> grows<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.899> the

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
so a plant called algae grows on the

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.699 
so a plant called algae grows on the
surface<00:01:37.709> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.310> lakes<00:01:38.659> but<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.840> blocks<00:01:40.319> the

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
surface of the lakes but that blocks the

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.430 
surface of the lakes but that blocks the
sunlight<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.640> coming<00:01:42.090> through<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.869> no<00:01:43.229> other

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
sunlight from coming through so no other

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.249 
sunlight from coming through so no other
plants<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.250> grow<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:45.659> means<00:01:45.929> that<00:01:45.990> there's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
plants can grow this means that there's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
plants can grow this means that there's
less<00:01:46.590> atmosphere<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.090> ponds<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.810> lakes

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
less atmosphere in the ponds and lakes

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.830 
less atmosphere in the ponds and lakes
and<00:01:49.530> therefore<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.789> fish<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.360> end<00:01:51.600> up

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and therefore all the fish will end up

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
and therefore all the fish will end up
dying<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.740> there's<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.159> enough<00:01:53.220> oxygen

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
dying because there's not enough oxygen

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
dying because there's not enough oxygen
in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> water<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.869> although<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.679> is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> big

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
in the water and although is is a big

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.230 
in the water and although is is a big
coating<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.179> top<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:57.869> algae<00:01:59.000> that's<00:02:00.000> your

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
coating on top of algae that's your

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
coating on top of algae that's your
traffic<00:02:00.479> ation
