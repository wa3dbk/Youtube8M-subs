00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.680
 there comes already such right 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370

 defensive that is 20 education is a 0 2 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.260
 for hannover 96 continues with the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.980
 first quarter we have at sv Werder 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 bremen sebastian prödl with 65 defense and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 at hannover 96, we have 64 with defense 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 that means a direct hit by SV Werder 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 bremen 1 2 so on with the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 second in bavaria at sv werder bremen 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 Unfortunately there was no other in distributors 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 There was already a card but it did not exist 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 Lukimya that it always there just always in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.210
 Real time plays that's why I had to go here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 the captain clemens fritz in the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 defending will be 69 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.920
 Defense and at Hannover 96 we have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 christian schulz also with 69 defense 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 that means the result is a 2 so 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.100
 he already has the left one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.770
 parties invited as we have in fact 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.530
 at sv werder bremen 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 santiago garcia and hannover 96 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.820
 we have silly micro alba 90 hope 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.329
 you on them important orientation on 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.930
 every case has 72 defenses here and 63 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.509
 defense has used alba and that means 2 2 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 equalizer already at the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.530
 first 6 1 arrived at the first 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.509
 centrally the beloved midfielders 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.329
 at sv werder bremen we have felix 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.770
 big with 64 defense 28 attack at 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.960
 midfielder is always legs 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 will always be added together at values 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.690
 and at Hannover 96 we have gisela and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.420
 Ward off 161 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.730
 that means big has three defenses more 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.400
 but two attack less and that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 is an overall difference of +1 for 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780
 felix big and that means yes 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.230
 leading hit 4 sv werder bremen 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.080
 you turn the game device to 2 here 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.380
 it continues with the other 26 as at 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.569
 96 manuel schmiedebach with 53 defense 43 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 attack and at sv werder bremens 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.610
 philipp bargfrede attack have the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.120
 both the same as at 43 but the defense 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.000
 worth it at 8 o'clock at the sv werder 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 Bremen is building the leadership of 4 2 so now 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.940
 It will be a bit offensive here 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.340
 namely the right midfielder 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 then as with sv werder bremen zlatko 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.120
 junuzovic and hannover 96 we have 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 edgar prib and there you can see that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.080
 We attacked twelve but has more the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.360
 the defense value at 16 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.170
 less and that means little 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.459
 match hit from 6 90 4 to 3 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.690
 so now it goes on with the left 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.900
 midfielder Werder bremen 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.959
 hajrovic with 90 attack 34 defense 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.120
 sorry and at Hannover 96 we have the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.760
 slide kinotage and there you can see 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.130
 that cinema days both values better and has 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510
 that means equalizer my dear ones 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.959
 friends what is going on here 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.790
 this 4 now are the offensive 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.500
 we've got midfielder tuned 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.299
 at sv werder bremen 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.609
 Ludovic Obraniak with 66 attacks 38 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.709
 Defense and at Hannover 96 years 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.320
 with the captains namely lars stindl 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.850
 lars stindl has the attack value so 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.269
 it has both values ​​more you can do so 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.280
 his 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.470
 that is renewed leadership strike first 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.480
 leads hannover 96 then outdated i say 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.750
 times werderbremen turned the game yet 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.609
 times to 4 2 and now it is again 45 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.410
 hannover 96 what's going on here 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.260
 people will be with the last 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.540
 card decided namely with the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.239
 the attacker and the attackers are two 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.549
 actually really good players namely 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.789
 at sv werder bremen we have franco di 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.700
 santo attacked at 69 and hannover 96 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.860
 we have attacked joselu with 670 and that 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.810
 say yes again again 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.189
 It is not possible to say that this is the case 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.689
 but on n24 i said to 64 96 yes people 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.389
 I already said that tops 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:37.689
 bundesliga wiggled sv werder beautiful 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.509
 Bremen and Hannover 96 ends 4 to 6 4 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.060
 hannover 96 but that for the reality 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.159
 I always make it clearly too high 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.949
 I always share the result by 2 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.439
 and then it comes out just 2 to 3 that 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.969
 i.e., a conclusion is that Hannover 96 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.620
 every case wins but actually am 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.409
 I'm not so sure though 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.629
 Hanover 690 wins in any case 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.849
 through the tops of bundesliga oracle stands 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.259
 it is clear that in any case k 690 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.870
 wins but it will be a close game 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.449
 be because sv werder bremen of course 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.680
 also offensive players and those can 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.419
 of course, too 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.770
 who knows should just look one 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.710
 sports show in 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.710
 17 19 clock I believe Saturday or 18 30 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.819
 euro on the club people yours 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.699
