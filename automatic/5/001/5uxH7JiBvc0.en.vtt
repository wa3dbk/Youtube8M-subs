00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
over how do you even do it so of course

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
over how do you even do it so of course
for<00:00:48.600> bands<00:00:48.960> fit<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.440> Overlord<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.129> of

for bands fit in one Overlord so of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.580 
for bands fit in one Overlord so of
course<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:51.480> hotkey<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.899> V<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.440> gonna

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
course my hotkey is V so I'm gonna

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
course my hotkey is V so I'm gonna
reference<00:00:53.070> everything<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.000> your

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
reference everything off that if your

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
reference everything off that if your
hotkey<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.449> different<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
hotkey is different then just do that so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
hotkey is different then just do that so
V<00:00:57.120> click<00:00:57.870> obviously<00:00:58.590> they're<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> drop

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
V click obviously they're going to drop

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
V click obviously they're going to drop
once<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.449> point<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
once they get to this point in time and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.840 
once they get to this point in time and
the<00:01:01.739> problem<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.399> drop<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.699> one

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the problem is that they drop them one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
the problem is that they drop them one
by<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.539> slow<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> Overlord<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
by one very slow and the Overlord can

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
by one very slow and the Overlord can
get<00:01:04.830> sniped<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
get sniped and so what we want to do is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.240 
get sniped and so what we want to do is
we<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> drop<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.920> we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we want to know how to drop them as we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
we want to know how to drop them as we
move<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.880> what's<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.119> happen<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:09.689> gonna

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
move so what's gonna happen is I'm gonna

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
move so what's gonna happen is I'm gonna
click<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.409> hotkey<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.010> select<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.880> I'm

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
click my hotkey and select then I'm

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
click my hotkey and select then I'm
gonna<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.390> hotkey<00:01:12.600> again<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> select<00:01:13.350> my

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
gonna do my hotkey again and select my

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
gonna do my hotkey again and select my
Overlord<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.430> he'll<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:15.229> start<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Overlord and so he'll actually start to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.370 
Overlord and so he'll actually start to
drop<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.009> he<00:01:18.000> moves<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.080> go

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
drop them as he moves so there we go

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
drop them as he moves so there we go
dropping<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.240> one<00:01:21.240> by<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.840> allows<00:01:22.259> them

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
dropping them one by one and allows them

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
dropping them one by one and allows them
to<00:01:22.470> chase<00:01:22.770> after<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.250> army<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.729> now

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to chase after what army they have now

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.580 
to chase after what army they have now
the<00:01:24.390> great<00:01:24.659> part<00:01:24.869> about<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.320> once<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the great part about this is once you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
the great part about this is once you
have<00:01:25.680> selected<00:01:25.860> your<00:01:26.159> Overlord<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
have selected your Overlord then you can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.700 
have selected your Overlord then you can
actually<00:01:27.720> move<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.110> wherever<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.409> want

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
actually move them wherever you want

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually move them wherever you want
because<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> times<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.549> Terran<00:01:29.850> army

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because a lot of times a Terran army

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
because a lot of times a Terran army
will<00:01:30.390> run<00:01:30.659> away<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.740> easily<00:01:31.860> do

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
will run away and so you can easily do

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
will run away and so you can easily do
this<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> run<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this and then if they start to run you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.300 
this and then if they start to run you
just<00:01:34.229> right-click<00:01:34.409> wherever<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
just right-click wherever you like and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.370 
just right-click wherever you like and
then<00:01:35.909> they'll<00:01:36.060> start<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> move<00:01:36.540> towards<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
then they'll start to move towards that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.700 
then they'll start to move towards that
opponent<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.689> we're<00:01:39.810> gonna<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
opponent so here we're gonna see the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
opponent so here we're gonna see the
effect<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> change<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.390> dropping<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
effect and the change with dropping the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289
