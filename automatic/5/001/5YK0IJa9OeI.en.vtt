with<00:02:53.030> our<00:02:53.209> lineup<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.810> feel<00:02:54.819> if<00:02:55.819> we<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.209> keep

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
with our lineup I feel if we just keep

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.479 
with our lineup I feel if we just keep
the<00:02:56.510> same<00:02:56.690> team<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.470> keep<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.739> same<00:02:57.950> team<00:02:58.250> I

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
the same team just keep the same team I

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.699 
the same team just keep the same team I
thought<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.150> only<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.019> will<00:03:00.500> probably

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
thought the only one that will probably

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.550 
thought the only one that will probably
be<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.519> changing<00:03:02.209> factor<00:03:02.660> someone<00:03:03.110> who<00:03:03.260> someone

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
be a changing factor someone who someone

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.050 
be a changing factor someone who someone
else<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:04.010> gonna<00:03:04.129> come<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.489> as<00:03:04.610> i<00:03:04.730> said<00:03:04.910> is

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
matage who will come off I'm not so sure

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.720 
matage who will come off I'm not so sure
I<00:03:08.650> thought<00:03:09.650> probably<00:03:09.920> someone<00:03:10.459> who's<00:03:10.610> been

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
I thought probably someone who's been

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.530 
I thought probably someone who's been
playing<00:03:10.910> recently<00:03:11.269> we<00:03:11.959> look<00:03:12.110> at<00:03:12.290> Ramirez<00:03:13.540> he

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
playing recently we look at Ramirez he

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.720 
playing recently we look at Ramirez he
might<00:03:14.810> not<00:03:14.989> get<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> game<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.739> be<00:03:15.859> honest<00:03:16.130> Oscar

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
might not get a game to be honest Oscar

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.240 
might not get a game to be honest Oscar
possibly<00:03:17.359> might<00:03:17.600> not<00:03:17.810> get<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.019> game<00:03:18.260> if<00:03:18.500> matage

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
possibly might not get a game if matage

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.890 
possibly might not get a game if matage

if we want to win the Champions League
there's<00:04:21.109> one<00:04:21.469> crucial

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
there's one crucial

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.760 
there's one crucial
crucial<00:04:23.240> ingredient<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.200> recipe<00:04:24.230> and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
crucial ingredient in the recipe and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.430 
crucial ingredient in the recipe and
that<00:04:25.490> ingredient<00:04:25.700> is<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.540> win<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.840> league<00:04:27.170> as

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
that ingredient is to win the league as

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.950 
that ingredient is to win the league as
soon<00:04:27.830> as<00:04:28.070> possible<00:04:28.700> if<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.360> can<00:04:29.600> get<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
soon as possible if we can get the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.920 
soon as possible if we can get the
league<00:04:30.140> done<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.770> dusted<00:04:31.010> ASAP<00:04:31.850> as<00:04:32.300> soon<00:04:32.360> as

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
league done and dusted ASAP as soon as

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.100 
league done and dusted ASAP as soon as
possible<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.880> can<00:04:35.060> focus<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> Champions

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
possible we can focus on the Champions

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.540 
possible we can focus on the Champions
League<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.440> believe<00:04:36.710> me<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:36.980> can<00:04:37.220> go<00:04:37.400> on<00:04:37.460> to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
League and believe me we can go on to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.350 
League and believe me we can go on to
win<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:37.850> but<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.570> league<00:04:38.810> has<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.200> be<00:04:39.350> sorted

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
win it but the league has to be sorted

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.140 
win it but the league has to be sorted
a.s.a.p<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:42.620> know<00:04:42.770> mathematically<00:04:43.760> we<00:04:44.030> have

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
a.s.a.p you know mathematically we have

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.840 
a.s.a.p you know mathematically we have
to<00:04:44.300> get<00:04:44.420> that<00:04:44.600> thing<00:04:44.660> over<00:04:45.400> we<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.550> go<00:04:46.640> eight

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
to get that thing over we can go eight

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.270 
to get that thing over we can go eight
points<00:04:47.030> clear<00:04:47.390> with<00:04:48.200> an<00:04:48.320> eight<00:04:48.440> point<00:04:48.680> gap<00:04:48.950> it

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
points clear with an eight point gap it

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.800 
points clear with an eight point gap it
would<00:04:49.520> mean<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.820> we<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.360> win<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.660> league

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
would mean that we can win the league

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.360 
would mean that we can win the league
three<00:04:51.170> games<00:04:51.410> before<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.950> end<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.220> season

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
three games before the end of the season

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.960 
three games before the end of the season
that's<00:04:53.330> mathematically<00:04:54.760> hopefully<00:04:55.760> City

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
that's mathematically hopefully City

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.420 
that's mathematically hopefully City
lose<00:04:56.150> points<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:56.990> hopefully<00:04:57.170> we<00:04:57.530> don't<00:04:57.740> that

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
lose points and hopefully we don't that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.160 
lose points and hopefully we don't that
would<00:04:58.580> be<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.790> perfect<00:04:58.970> ending<00:04:59.270> then<00:04:59.900> we<00:05:00.020> can

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
would be the perfect ending then we can

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.690 
would be the perfect ending then we can
probably<00:05:00.410> end<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> four<00:05:01.040> or<00:05:01.160> five<00:05:01.400> games

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
probably end it four or five games

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.130 
probably end it four or five games
before<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.180> end<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.450> season<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.990> is<00:05:03.110> a

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
before the end of the season that is a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.950 
before the end of the season that is a
massive<00:05:03.650> massive<00:05:04.070> amount<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.030> time<00:05:05.300> for<00:05:05.570> us<00:05:05.930> to

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
massive massive amount of time for us to

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.600 
massive massive amount of time for us to
focus<00:05:06.260> on<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.620> Champions<00:05:07.040> League<00:05:07.070> should<00:05:07.460> we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
focus on the Champions League should we

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.930 
focus on the Champions League should we
make<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:08.150> semi-final<00:05:08.870> for<00:05:09.080> example<00:05:09.790> if<00:05:10.790> we

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
make the semi-final for example if we

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.370 
make the semi-final for example if we
make<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.210> semi-final<00:05:11.840> we<00:05:12.020> have<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.200> league

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
make the semi-final we have the league

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.620 
make the semi-final we have the league
done<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.730> really<00:05:13.970> focus<00:05:14.210> on<00:05:14.540> the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
done we can really focus on the
