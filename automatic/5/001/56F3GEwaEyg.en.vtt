00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 kevin just has it the funniest one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.140
 twenty people fall down 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello we together the film factory 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.250
 Bestiality now comes with us - and that 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 is the story of two best 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 girlfriend jenny and burny and they are 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.160
 not at fixed relationships now 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 interested but never takes 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 and at that time would have proved 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.550
 because that's how the two leftists ran 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 and suddenly he learns to bernie 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 but a woman know where he is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.789
 can imagine more and he wants to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 not that it's so official now 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.059
 Date is taking his best buddy 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.250
 she brings her best friend anna with her 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 and suddenly everybody loves each other 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.820
 no there are no ferry relations 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 but this creates two fixed ones 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 relationships and that's funny 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 if you just go all the time 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
 easygoing on the way and suddenly 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
 Both are in a relationship that can 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.280
 go well and keep a friendship 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 which then also that at one time not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 only two people are there but they are quasi 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.289
 to 14 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.879
 how the whole looks and you can 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.340
 think a little bit about it now 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 this movie can be here in the trailer 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 So he recently told ries last 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.420
 night was there this needs you 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.820
 Drink what I drink what then we are 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 to me this gorny really has it on it 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 was ladies night i wanted to have fun 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.619
 I constantly I talked myself 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.000
 impressed I've the feeling 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.680
 good and evil are on the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.729
 game 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.020
 you just have to have a nice one 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.850
 Woman looking for take home 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 and lexie flat do you know what 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 problem is you just look too good 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.690
 What the best thing about a face 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.030
 could be during an accident 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.830
 this is my roommate and that is 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.830
 danny marten makes me happy too 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.260
 I can not believe that I am the first 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 have date slept with him tell 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.900
 we all his eyes 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 his body has not turned out to be a buddy 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.710
 I congratulate the abu dhabi mar where 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.270
 do you know that one and my sweet where 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.620
 Overall, like my sweet sms 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.730
 sent her number you do not get 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.410
 after all he was last night 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.580
 14 have found you too good 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 I do not have a boyfriend right now 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.740
 and I pretend I did not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.630
 seen the Dorffest and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.620
 friendship requests are looking for what are you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.120
 A 13 year old girl I realize that 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.350
 you make that and I take everything 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 it's up to her I'm kind of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 jealous but I am very happy 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.950
 really shit for you 1 yet 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.340
 you look great that's the meter from that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 is a disaster struck the damn 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 He will not put it down if she is not in 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.860
 siegburg quickly made the price out of cardboard 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.210
 eat in the bag and 80 if 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.590
 you let the story through and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.450
 you can also see the trailer 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.400
 now that you are not a big cinema 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.530
 entertainment and no masterpiece 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.970
 but you do not have to expect either 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.960
 because right now when the wm is running 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.640
 I think it's just nice that 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.890
 again movies in the cinemas anyway 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.370
 come and that is a successful one 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.440
 Variation beautifully said love comedies 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.820
 drowning you have to say that the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.260
 Characters definitely sympathetic 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.470
 and canon just has a cool guy 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.840
 the now 120 is probably under 61 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.380
 then it really is really very 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 small 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 There are cool slogans and there it is 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.660
 quite fun to look at 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.370
 just on such a balmy summer night 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.840
 when we say we're leaving we still go 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.610
 Watch a movie, maybe 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.860
 in cocktail or a little bit then 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.060
 does that fit because you can get a lot from that for 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.830
 expect me to compose but 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.200
 He can definitely expect to expect 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.300
 skilful and sympathetic so that the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 film in any case more than handsome 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.690
 if film itself in estoril one 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.459
 is a bit predictable and that too 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.900
 he just got more built up 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.670
 you can decorate the whole beautiful 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
 for example with music and that succeeds 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.030
 The soundtrack is very good here 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.890
 really very nice indeed 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.590
 So also says john legend takes the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.630
 very very many personally but very 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.020
 of course, it's so klimper klimper really 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.400
 is fitting to the movie he says it and 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.730
 definitely worth it to sit sometimes 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.640
 also with it and thinks that suits 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.410
 whole screen that you can imagine 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.510
 But you do not have to do that and that 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.010
 But it is not bad at all 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.300
 films also have their authority and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.800
 that's what makes the film that way and 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.680
 Wise too, I would like to have you 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.540
 There is a movie he knows now 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.739
 so jo ok from but the music right 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.420
 cool that you are so kind 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.459
 was rung in the film watching 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.630
 it writes my comments when i am 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.220
 curious and maybe there's the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.870
 one or another musical tip 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.090
 by me for you now with john legend 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.190
 or just the other way around for you 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.900
 others or for me my personal 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.250
 rating was accordingly also 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.230
 it is not a masterpiece but neither 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.430
 There is still a bonus 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 on top of that he was at the wm 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.330
 starts and says come fuck on football 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.280
 you can also come to the cinema six of 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.109
 there are ten points for me to build 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.640
 can envy you can just watch 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.300
 if you do not have him in the cinema right now 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.919
 looks and later on dvd and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.750
 You will not be watching TV at home 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.250
 and I would like to say that 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.229
 you can see the big screen 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.430
 But you do not have to do what you do 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.240
 definitely has to do here 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.370
 yet another video about the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.250
