00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.100
 hello friends with you karadar my name is 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.139
 Ivan Bulls Today's Video Review 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.750
 hybrid radar detector with 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.599
 DVR but the line-x kopecks 9700 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.929
 Well, according to tradition, let's start with a complete set 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.189
 does not go himself radar detector mount 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:30.339
 on the suction cup 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.339
 or on a double-sided adhesive tape power cord 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.579
 mount for wire on two way 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.450
 scotch that you can easily 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.830
 to let 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.180
 wire through the cabin and it will not hang out 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.020
 warranty card and manual 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 user 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.810
 + Included is a type of memory card 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.400
 micro sd standard card sorry 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.250
 Memory not included 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.410
 so you can purchase a card 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 memory separately for example we recommend 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.810
 transcend premium 300x 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.080
 records that is, it is higher than grade 10 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.699
 speeds for example 64 megabytes 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.369
 there is a DVR quietly 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.710
 supports this memory card and with these 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.580
 memory cards work for a year without 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.780
 problems unlike other brands by 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.730
 about the DVR itself that is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.820
 DVR full line of people 500 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.770
 already familiar construction but here 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.870
 manufacturer reduced a little 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.840
 dimensions of the radar part 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.909
 I mean, how much did it affect the reception? 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.760
 signal unfortunately now say 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.580
 impossible but judging by how we 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.100
 turned on him that is interference he reacts 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.100
 quite adequate for example when working 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 another radar detector interference it does not 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.130
 catches respectively screen 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.560
 stayed the same size too 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 touch all control touch 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.000
 well actually 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.390
 here is the standard connector 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.960
 micro sd memory card and connector 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.990
 power front button power button 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.520
 emergency recording and reset the beginning of what 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.520
 if the registrar brought 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.520
 it is equipped with a new processor ie it is 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.350
 ambarella from 7 to 30 certainly not the most 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.260
 senior line processors 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.420
 but they still give good processing 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
 video signal 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 plus which is very important in this video 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.660
 recorders than different from 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.709
 the previous one is of course the sony matrix 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.140
 exmor imx322 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 that is, in theory, he should shoot 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.170
 much better than its predecessor it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 It will be expressed primarily in 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.800
 night shooting day shooting we know 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.470
 all practically dvr 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.500
 take off well well here evening night 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.230
 shooting respectively trouble for many 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.780
 DVRs here judging by was 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.090
 beer and another sony exmor manufacturer 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.820
 shows a very good picture 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.390
 in the evening and at night well, respectively, if 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.310
 do you want to write a video at night when 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.519
 for example you are absent in the car 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.890
 video recorder offline 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.680
 removes then I recommend to purchase here 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.820
 such a device in this case is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 star power box key 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.930
 then here we have on the one hand 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 connecting to the cigarette lighter socket then 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.060
 there is no wire cut in which case 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 the guarantee is not lost here 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.220
 in the other side, that is, there are two ways 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.320
 on plus and minus 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.510
 constant power where constantly 12 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.110
 car volt this unit 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.299
 provides shutdown when reaching 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.610
 11 6 volts that is, you can always 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.910
 come and start the car even if 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.580
 left for 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.020
 some time without a car 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.820
 accordingly, you just stand on 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.990
 parking lot 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.700
 problems because we really are 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.180
 when sits down to feel 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.960
 battery and a person can not start 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.950
 That's about shooting, I already said well 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.910
 let's turn it on let's see how it is 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.540
 displays on the screen for those who do not 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.540
 familiar with this 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.430
 we see the screensaver online 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:38.900
 And we see the record, that is, the screen is touch 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.650
 here we choose the desired and financial yet 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.480
 memory card select all settings 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.800
 radar detector and video recorder 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.910
 occur on the screen itself 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.560
 according to the buttons do not use 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:05:13.820
 need well let's see how he reacts to 3 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:15.830
 not born normal sound that is not 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.730
 very nasty volume can 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.860
 adjust 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.030
 here accordingly when he catches 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.930
 gps satellites 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.760
 at low speed, it will not have this 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.300
 disturb but at the moment we see 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.590
 what satellite what caught here the device 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.860
 I really like it especially because 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.680
 mounting such on double sided tape 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.610
 you can, if desired, put 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.920
 turning it over to a torpedo like that 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.580
 position that is you will see it 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.040
 here so there will be a torpedo he will 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.880
 stand below is a very interesting option 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.460
 Installation but while in the menu I did not see 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.340
 about screen flip pictures 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.400
 I think here is just a producer through 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.490
 some time coming days will release 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.430
 updated firmware that is bye bye 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.529
 it can be set to classic 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:18.549
 in the way that we will look 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.619
 on you like this if you liked the video 

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:23.559
 review put light subscribe to 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:25.479
 Our channel do not forget about accessories and 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:29.309
 quality installation from the company 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.309
 Caradar is good on roads for now
