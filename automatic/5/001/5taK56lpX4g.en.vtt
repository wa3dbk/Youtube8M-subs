00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
to show you um in my opinion I think
this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.620> currently<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> most<00:00:08.940> overpowered

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this is currently the most overpowered

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is currently the most overpowered
gun<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.809> game<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.370> it's

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
gun the game and it's not like that it's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.049 
gun the game and it's not like that it's
super<00:00:11.969> overpowered<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.500> i<00:00:13.769> mean

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
super overpowered it's just it's i mean

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
super overpowered it's just it's i mean
this<00:00:15.059> isn't<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.199> best<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this isn't on I think the best kind of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.630 
this isn't on I think the best kind of
game<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.550> you

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
game like that right there like you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.120 
game like that right there like you
don't<00:00:17.820> need<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.600> aim<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> site<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.710> think

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
don't need to aim down the site I think

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
don't need to aim down the site I think
I<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.960> better<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.439> use

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I really think that it is better to use

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
I really think that it is better to use
this<00:00:22.740> gun<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.220> close-quarter<00:00:23.699> situations<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.490 
it's kind of good looking it's weird
look<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.810> mean<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
look like just look I mean that the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
look like just look I mean that the
shotguns<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.220> killing<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.760> situation<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
shotguns not killing that situation but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
shotguns not killing that situation but
this<00:01:12.600> gun<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.350> hit<00:01:13.770> fire<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.520> thing<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
this gun is I hit fire and the thing is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
this gun is I hit fire and the thing is
is<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:16.020> 55<00:01:16.680> points<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
is that it's got actually 55 points of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
is that it's got actually 55 points of
damage<00:01:17.220> per<00:01:17.369> bullet<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.299> three<00:01:18.479> round

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
damage per bullet it's a three round

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.179 
damage per bullet it's a three round
burst<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.590> bullets<00:01:19.799> hit<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
burst so if two of them bullets hit you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
burst so if two of them bullets hit you
you're<00:01:20.670> most<00:01:20.820> likely<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.630> gonna

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you're most likely that now I'm gonna

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
you're most likely that now I'm gonna
tell<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> best<00:01:22.290> combination<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.920> use

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
tell you the best combination to use

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.240 
tell you the best combination to use
with<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.299> most<00:01:24.600> likely<00:01:24.720> um<00:01:25.250> use

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
with it then that's most likely um use

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
with it then that's most likely um use
the<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.909> attachment<00:01:27.840> proficiency<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> use

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the two attachment proficiency and use

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
the two attachment proficiency and use
red<00:01:29.250> dot<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.640> rapid-fire<00:01:30.270> rapid-fire<00:01:30.540> on
