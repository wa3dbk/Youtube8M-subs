controversy<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:32.930> whether<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:33.500> should<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.830> it

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
controversy of whether we should have it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.890 
controversy of whether we should have it
or<00:01:34.070> not<00:01:34.250> because<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.150> move<00:01:35.690> that<00:01:35.810> was

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
or not because it is a move that was

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.400 
or not because it is a move that was
associated<00:01:36.230> primarily<00:01:37.010> with<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.490> 3d<00:01:37.910> Sonics

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
associated primarily with the 3d Sonics

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.530 
associated primarily with the 3d Sonics
once<00:01:39.410> people<00:01:39.800> started<00:01:40.310> playing<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.790> though<00:01:40.970> we

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
once people started playing it though we

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.350 
once people started playing it though we
found<00:01:41.780> especially<00:01:42.050> here<00:01:42.560> at<00:01:42.590> e3<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.670> once

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
found especially here at e3 that once

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.790 
found especially here at e3 that once
they<00:01:44.480> got<00:01:44.600> used<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:44.960> tempo<00:01:45.410> they<00:01:45.590> just

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
they got used to that tempo they just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.140 
they got used to that tempo they just
couldn't<00:01:45.980> get<00:01:46.100> enough<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.670> mean<00:01:46.940> it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
couldn't get enough of it I mean it

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.880 
couldn't get enough of it I mean it
started<00:01:47.780> becoming<00:01:48.050> second<00:01:48.470> nature<00:01:48.620> to<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
started becoming second nature to the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.740 
started becoming second nature to the
players<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.030> when<00:01:50.150> Sonic<00:01:50.450> had<00:01:50.659> the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
players just like when Sonic had the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.510 
players just like when Sonic had the
Spin<00:01:50.990> Dash<00:01:51.020> for<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.380> first<00:01:51.620> time<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:52.370> went

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
Spin Dash for the first time you went

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
Spin Dash for the first time you went
back<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.970> played<00:01:53.030> sonic<00:01:53.360> 1<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.930> felt<00:01:54.290> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
back and played sonic 1 and it felt the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.680 
back and played sonic 1 and it felt the
almost-naked<00:01:54.890> not<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> have<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.510> homing

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
almost-naked not to have it the homing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.720 
almost-naked not to have it the homing
attack<00:01:56.840> will<00:01:57.230> do<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.500> for<00:01:57.530> sonic<00:01:57.950> for<00:01:58.159> now<00:01:58.670> we

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
attack will do that for sonic for now we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.130 
attack will do that for sonic for now we
got<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.000> talk<00:01:59.180> about<00:01:59.300> characters<00:01:59.810> because

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
got to talk about characters because

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.080 
got to talk about characters because
some<00:02:00.470> people<00:02:00.770> maybe<00:02:01.220> didn't<00:02:01.700> care<00:02:01.880> for<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
some people maybe didn't care for the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.540 
some people maybe didn't care for the
characters<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.570> some<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:02.990> later<00:02:03.200> games

episode one we want you to go back and
reimagine<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.120> remember<00:02:11.629> what

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
reimagine and remember what

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.040 
reimagine and remember what
loved<00:02:12.220> about<00:02:12.459> Sonic<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:12.909> Hedgehog<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.930> do

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
loved about Sonic the Hedgehog and to do

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.420 
loved about Sonic the Hedgehog and to do
that<00:02:14.080> we're<00:02:14.409> gonna<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.860> focus<00:02:15.069> on<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
that we're gonna have to focus on the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.729 
that we're gonna have to focus on the
big<00:02:15.580> blue<00:02:15.700> guy<00:02:15.909> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.750> episode<00:02:17.080> 1<00:02:17.440> so

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
big blue guy this is episode 1 so

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.899 
big blue guy this is episode 1 so
clearly<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.099> means<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.580> are<00:02:18.640> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.849> be

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
clearly that means there are going to be

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.970 
clearly that means there are going to be
more<00:02:19.120> titles<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:19.900> more<00:02:20.140> sequels<00:02:20.620> coming<00:02:20.920> up

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
more titles or more sequels coming up

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280 
more titles or more sequels coming up
that<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.430> correct<00:02:21.610> Sonic<00:02:22.150> 4<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> huge<00:02:22.930> saga

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
that is correct Sonic 4 is a huge saga

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.289 
that is correct Sonic 4 is a huge saga
but<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> order<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.950> sort<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.340> offer<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
but in order to sort of offer it to the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.690 
but in order to sort of offer it to the
consumers<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.019> an<00:02:26.170> intelligent<00:02:26.560> manner<00:02:27.099> we

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
consumers in an intelligent manner we

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.009 
consumers in an intelligent manner we
decided<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.209> split<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.629> up<00:02:28.720> into<00:02:28.870> different

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
decided to split it up into different

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.350 
decided to split it up into different
episodes<00:02:29.739> now<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> finite<00:02:31.060> number<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
episodes now there is a finite number of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.820 
episodes now there is a finite number of
episodes<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.140> isn't<00:02:32.470> something<00:02:32.650> that

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
episodes so this isn't something that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.369 
episodes so this isn't something that
we're<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> see<00:02:33.760> sonic<00:02:34.090> 4<00:02:34.390> episode<00:02:34.840> 9<00:02:35.110> or

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
we're going to see sonic 4 episode 9 or

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.930 
we're going to see sonic 4 episode 9 or
something<00:02:35.769> there's<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.160> very<00:02:36.370> finite<00:02:36.730> amount

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
something there's a very finite amount

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.259 
something there's a very finite amount
of<00:02:37.120> episodes<00:02:37.629> they<00:02:38.530> are<00:02:38.590> very<00:02:39.190> good<00:02:39.519> as<00:02:39.790> far<00:02:39.819> as

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
of episodes they are very good as far as

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.660 
of episodes they are very good as far as
length<00:02:40.599> is<00:02:40.810> concerned<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.890> first<00:02:42.129> episode<00:02:42.610> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
length is concerned the first episode is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.569 
length is concerned the first episode is
going<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.849> have<00:02:43.030> roughly<00:02:43.750> 24<00:02:44.260> levels<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.489> is

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
going to have roughly 24 levels so it is

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.460 
going to have roughly 24 levels so it is
a<00:02:45.610> pretty<00:02:45.849> good<00:02:46.090> chunk<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.390> gameplay<00:02:46.780> by<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
a pretty good chunk of gameplay by the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.350 
a pretty good chunk of gameplay by the
time<00:02:47.769> Sonic<00:02:48.190> 4<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.459> complete<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:49.000> will<00:02:49.030> be<00:02:49.209> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
time Sonic 4 is complete it will be the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.830 
time Sonic 4 is complete it will be the
largest<00:02:49.799> Genesis<00:02:50.799> style<00:02:51.099> game<00:02:51.430> sega<00:02:52.299> has<00:02:52.450> ever
