good and is nicely proportioned there's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.800 
good and is nicely proportioned there's
also<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.500> rare<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:42.830> quirky<00:00:43.520> saloon<00:00:43.910> which<00:00:44.180> VW

also a rare and quirky saloon which VW
must<00:00:45.050> have<00:00:45.200> thought<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.440> good<00:00:45.710> idea<00:00:46.130> because<00:00:46.280> it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
must have thought a good idea because it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.400 
must have thought a good idea because it
gives<00:00:46.640> more<00:00:46.850> choice<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.570> range<00:00:47.840> in

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
reality though it's pretty ugly and its

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.720 
reality though it's pretty ugly and its
unpopularity<00:00:50.930> will<00:00:51.740> mean<00:00:51.920> selling<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.460> again

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
unpopularity will mean selling it again

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
and drove it it certainly cannot be
