00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you can only use matte eyeshadow if

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.880 
you can only use matte eyeshadow if
you're<00:01:28.680> older<00:01:32.119> Matt<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:33.780> soft<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you're older Matt can be very soft but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010

it<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.100> also<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.670> strong<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.509> deep

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it can also be very strong and very deep

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.819 
it can also be very strong and very deep
I<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> use<00:01:38.340> matte<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.049> contrast<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I like to use matte as a contrast to the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.760 
I like to use matte as a contrast to the
shimmer<00:01:45.020> cons<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> brings<00:01:46.439> everything

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
shimmer cons it brings everything

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.760 
shimmer cons it brings everything
together<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> matte<00:01:51.570> color<00:01:51.899> makes<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> eyes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
together the matte color makes the eyes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
together the matte color makes the eyes
look<00:01:52.799> deeper<00:01:53.810> wider<00:01:55.280> more<00:01:56.280> bright<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.149> that's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
look deeper wider more bright and that's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690 
look deeper wider more bright and that's
