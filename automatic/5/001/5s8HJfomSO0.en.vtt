question<00:00:08.700> number<00:00:08.940> 58

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
question number 58

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.209 
question number 58
this<00:00:09.840> was<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.139> eighth<00:00:10.349> question<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this was the eighth question in the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.009 
this was the eighth question in the
quantitative<00:00:11.670> section<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.420> garden<00:00:12.809> house

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
quantitative section of the garden house

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.890 
quantitative section of the garden house
in<00:00:13.200> six<00:00:13.349> paper<00:00:14.120> okay<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> question<00:00:15.509> goes

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
in six paper okay so the question goes

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.660 
in six paper okay so the question goes
like<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.500> number<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> solutions<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
like this the number of solutions of the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.170 
like this the number of solutions of the
equation<00:00:18.300> 2x<00:00:18.539> plus<00:00:18.810> y<00:00:19.199> equals<00:00:19.230> 240<00:00:20.070> where<00:00:20.910> both

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
equation 2x plus y equals 240 where both

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.390 
equation 2x plus y equals 240 where both
x<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> y<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:21.900> positive<00:00:22.560> integers<00:00:23.070> such<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
x and y are positive integers such that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900 
x and y are positive integers such that
y<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.880> greater<00:00:24.269> than<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.810> equal<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.170> x<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.800> 1<00:00:26.279> so

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
y is greater than or equal to x is 1 so

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
y is greater than or equal to x is 1 so
we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> find<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> number<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> positive

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
we have to find the number of positive

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.880 
we have to find the number of positive
solutions<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.619> question

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
solutions for this so in this question

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.130 
solutions for this so in this question
you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.960> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
you know what do you have to do is you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.049 
you know what do you have to do is you
just<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.890> start<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> question<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> heal

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
just have to start the question and heal

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
just have to start the question and heal
the<00:00:36.270> pattern<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.840> start<00:00:37.290> emerging<00:00:38.070> there

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the pattern will start emerging there

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
the pattern will start emerging there
self<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.790> D<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.570> since<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.559> positive

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
self on D so since they have positive

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.889 
self on D so since they have positive
integers<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.730> cannot<00:00:42.059> take<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> values

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
integers they cannot take the values

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
integers they cannot take the values
negative<00:00:43.320> value<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:43.950> they<00:00:44.160> cannot<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.640> equal

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
negative value so they cannot be equal

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.630 
negative value so they cannot be equal
to<00:00:45.030> zero<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.539> well<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.190> start

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to zero as well so I'm going to start

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240 
to zero as well so I'm going to start
with<00:00:47.940> X<00:00:48.239> equal<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> 1<00:00:49.079> why<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.649> starting<00:00:50.129> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
with X equal to 1 why I'm starting with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
with X equal to 1 why I'm starting with
X<00:00:50.430> equal<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> minus<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
X equal to minus that because this is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.540 
X equal to minus that because this is
gonna<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.620> define<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
gonna be this is what will define the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
gonna be this is what will define the
equation<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.410> 2x<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.160> know

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
equation for me because it's 2x you know

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
equation for me because it's 2x you know
all<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.730> start<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> number<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:00.780> has

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
all this start with the number which has

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
all this start with the number which has
a<00:01:01.260> number<00:01:01.620> multiplied<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.430> greater

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
a number multiplied with a greater

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
a number multiplied with a greater
number<00:01:02.879> multiplied<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.470> say<00:01:04.619> X<00:01:04.860> equal<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
number multiplied so if I say X equal to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.660 
number multiplied so if I say X equal to
1<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.720> part<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
1 then this part over here is going to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.230 
1 then this part over here is going to
be<00:01:08.850> equal<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> 2<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.140> X<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> equal<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.220> 2<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
be equal to 2 if X is equal to 2 this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 
be equal to 2 if X is equal to 2 this
part<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> 4<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.130> similarly<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
part over here would be 4 so similarly I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.230 
part over here would be 4 so similarly I
have<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.360> pattern<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
have this pattern over here that this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
have this pattern over here that this is
what<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> follow<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:19.979> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what is going to be follow so I'm just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.600 
what is going to be follow so I'm just
gonna<00:01:20.930> write<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> values<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.460> I'm

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
gonna write some of the values here I'm

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.770 
gonna write some of the values here I'm
not<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> write<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.479> values

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
not going to write all the values

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.090 
not going to write all the values
because<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> pattern

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because I know there is a pattern

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
because I know there is a pattern
waiting<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.750> similarly<00:01:28.439> if

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
waiting for me there right similarly if

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
waiting for me there right similarly if
X<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.729> equal<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> 1<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> value

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
X is equal to 1 this is what the value

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
X is equal to 1 this is what the value
is<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.150> equal<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> 40<00:01:34.110> I'll<00:01:34.350> have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is to get is this equal to 40 I'll have

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030 
is to get is this equal to 40 I'll have
my<00:01:34.950> Y<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.549> equal<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:36.030> 38<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.110> 38<00:01:37.740> plus

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
my Y to be equal to 38 then only 38 plus

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
my Y to be equal to 38 then only 38 plus
2<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> equal<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.970> 40<00:01:39.329> similarly<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
2 will be equal to 40 similarly this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.580 
2 will be equal to 40 similarly this
would<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.770> 36<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.720> bathroom<00:01:43.170> 34<00:01:44.180> 32

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
would be 36 and I have my bathroom 34 32

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
would be 36 and I have my bathroom 34 32
30<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.750> 28<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.710> 26<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
30 and 28 then 26 now I just have to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.609 
30 and 28 then 26 now I just have to
find<00:01:52.200> till<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.549> Y<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.750> either<00:01:55.049> greater

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
find till what Y will be either greater

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.690 
find till what Y will be either greater
than<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.280> equal<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.360> X<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.250> keep

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
than or equal to X so if I'm keep

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.380 
than or equal to X so if I'm keep
extending<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> pattern<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.880> I'll<00:02:02.880> keep

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
extending the pattern here I'll keep

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
extending the pattern here I'll keep
getting<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.049> number<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.740> similarly<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
getting this number and similarly if I

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.210 
getting this number and similarly if I
keep<00:02:06.090> extending<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.990> pattern<00:02:07.469> here<00:02:07.950> I'll

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
keep extending the pattern here I'll

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.480 
keep extending the pattern here I'll
keep<00:02:09.090> getting<00:02:09.569> these

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
keep getting these

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.600 
keep getting these
numbers<00:02:10.940> right<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.560> would<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.920> 8<00:02:13.220> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
numbers right so this would be 8 this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.300 
numbers right so this would be 8 this
would<00:02:13.880> be<00:02:14.060> 9<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:15.050> would<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.530> 10

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
would be 9 this would be 10

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.000 
would be 9 this would be 10
similarly<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.290> know<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.710> falling

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
similarly if I you know I'm just falling

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.750 
similarly if I you know I'm just falling
short<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.310> space<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:19.850> do<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.150> 12<00:02:20.600> 11<00:02:21.200> 12<00:02:22.100> so

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
short of space if I do like 12 11 12 so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.250 
short of space if I do like 12 11 12 so
this<00:02:22.910> would<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.300> 22<00:02:23.780> 24<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.900> would<00:02:27.110> be

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
this would be 22 24 and this would be

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.620 
this would be 22 24 and this would be
again<00:02:27.910> 22<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:30.020> would<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:31.420> sorry<00:02:32.420> this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
again 22 and this would be sorry this

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.840 
again 22 and this would be sorry this
would<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:32.960> 16<00:02:33.710> 18<00:02:34.480> 20<00:02:35.480> 22<00:02:35.680> 24<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:36.950> would<00:02:37.130> be<00:02:37.310> 20

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
would be 16 18 20 22 24 this would be 20

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.170 
would be 16 18 20 22 24 this would be 20
this<00:02:37.880> would<00:02:38.240> be<00:02:38.360> 18<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:40.220> would<00:02:40.460> be<00:02:40.640> 60

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
this would be 18 and this would be 60

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
this would be 18 and this would be 60
white<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:42.350> now<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.980> see<00:02:43.160> till<00:02:43.430> where

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
white so now you have to see till where

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.930 
white so now you have to see till where
Y<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.150> greater<00:02:44.780> than<00:02:44.900> equal<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.530> X<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.670> see

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
Y is greater than equal to X if you see

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.680 
Y is greater than equal to X if you see
that<00:02:47.270> till<00:02:47.960> here<00:02:48.230> Y<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.560> equal<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.130> 22<00:02:49.460> X<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:50.000> 9<00:02:50.270> Y

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
that till here Y is equal to 22 X is 9 Y

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.290 
that till here Y is equal to 22 X is 9 Y
is<00:02:50.750> equal<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> 20<00:02:51.530> X<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:51.920> 10<00:02:52.220> y<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.640> equal<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:52.970> 11

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
is equal to 20 X is 10 y is equal to 11

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.140 
is equal to 20 X is 10 y is equal to 11
X<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.570> 28<00:02:54.050> Y<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.350> equal<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> 16<00:02:55.010> X<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.310> 12

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
X is 28 Y is equal to 16 X is 12

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
X is 28 Y is equal to 16 X is 12
sill<00:02:56.450> still<00:02:57.230> X<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.920> greater<00:02:58.100> X<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.970> less<00:02:59.210> than<00:02:59.240> Y

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
sill still X is greater X is less than Y

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.310 
sill still X is greater X is less than Y
so<00:03:00.590> if<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.220> again<00:03:01.640> increase<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.510> further<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.960> make

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
so if I again increase it further I make

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.950 
so if I again increase it further I make
X<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:04.100> equal<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.520> 13<00:03:05.000> Y<00:03:05.240> will<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.630> equal<00:03:05.690> to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
X to be equal to 13 Y will be equal to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.580 
X to be equal to 13 Y will be equal to
14<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.640> has<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.180> 26<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.470> I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
14 because this has to be 26 and if I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.210 
14 because this has to be 26 and if I
say<00:03:09.770> X<00:03:09.950> equal<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.400> 14<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.540> would<00:03:11.780> be<00:03:11.930> 28<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.860> Y

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
say X equal to 14 this would be 28 and Y

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.210 
say X equal to 14 this would be 28 and Y
would<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.460> for<00:03:13.850> each<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:14.900> at<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.470> point<00:03:15.830> X

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
would be for each one so at this point X

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.100 
would be for each one so at this point X
becomes<00:03:16.760> greater<00:03:17.060> than<00:03:17.300> Y<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> means<00:03:17.900> for

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
becomes greater than Y that means for

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.640 
becomes greater than Y that means for
all<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.680> other<00:03:18.890> values<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.970> X<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.290> less<00:03:21.620> than

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
all the other values and X is less than

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.940 
all the other values and X is less than
Y<00:03:22.220> or<00:03:22.700> Y<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.450> greater<00:03:23.840> than<00:03:23.930> equal<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.380> X<00:03:24.710> as

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
Y or Y is greater than equal to X as

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.120 
Y or Y is greater than equal to X as
specified<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> condition<00:03:27.170> there<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.890> just

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
specified in the condition there so just

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.860 
specified in the condition there so just
count<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.580> values<00:03:28.940> 1<00:03:29.150> 2<00:03:29.180> 3<00:03:29.750> 4<00:03:30.290> 5<00:03:30.650> 6<00:03:31.010> 7<00:03:31.340> 8<00:03:31.640> 9<00:03:32.000> 10<00:03:32.420> 11

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
count the values 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
count the values 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12<00:03:33.230> 13<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.250> 13<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.880> my<00:03:35.270> answer<00:03:35.900> right<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.800> you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
12 13 so 13 is my answer right so you

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.470 
12 13 so 13 is my answer right so you
can<00:03:37.070> see<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.550> look<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.060> patterns

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
can see you just look for the patterns

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.840 
can see you just look for the patterns
there<00:03:38.660> might<00:03:38.840> be<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.050> bigger<00:03:39.380> pattern<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.610> you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
there might be a bigger pattern that you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.640 
there might be a bigger pattern that you
can<00:03:40.880> judge<00:03:41.330> from<00:03:41.570> there<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:41.960> you<00:03:42.350> know<00:03:42.470> what

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
can judge from there but you know what

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.230 
can judge from there but you know what
I'm<00:03:42.830> doing<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.430> question<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.060> very

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
I'm doing this question for the very

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.180 
I'm doing this question for the very
first<00:03:44.480> time<00:03:44.780> when<00:03:45.050> I'm<00:03:45.170> explaining<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:45.980> you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
first time when I'm explaining it to you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.360 
first time when I'm explaining it to you
why<00:03:46.490> because<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:47.500> need<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.680> give<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
why because I need to give you the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.180 
why because I need to give you the
concept<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:50.240> comes<00:03:50.510> right<00:03:51.110> there<00:03:51.680> during

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
concept that comes right there during

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.370 
concept that comes right there during
the<00:03:52.490> exam<00:03:52.790> not<00:03:53.360> just<00:03:53.690> something<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.110> I've

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
the exam not just something that I've

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.280 
the exam not just something that I've
prepared<00:03:54.860> like<00:03:55.190> two<00:03:55.580> hours<00:03:55.850> before<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.630> want<00:03:57.110> to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
prepared like two hours before I want to

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.500 
prepared like two hours before I want to
show<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:57.860> what<00:03:58.370> do<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.610> do<00:03:58.760> when<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.180> see<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
show you what do I do when I see a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.570 
show you what do I do when I see a
question<00:04:00.050> there<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.470> then<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.800> think<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.430> is

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
question there and then I think this is

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.670 
question there and then I think this is
what<00:04:01.790> most<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.300> us<00:04:02.480> will<00:04:02.690> be<00:04:02.720> doing<00:04:03.020> rather

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
what most of us will be doing rather

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.620 
what most of us will be doing rather
than<00:04:04.010> waiting<00:04:04.340> there<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:04.910> trying<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.300> find<00:04:05.480> a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
than waiting there and trying to find a

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.210 
than waiting there and trying to find a
bigger<00:04:05.840> pattern<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.530> trying<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.830> find<00:04:07.010> an

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
bigger pattern and trying to find an

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.310 
bigger pattern and trying to find an
answer<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.580> just<00:04:07.850> two<00:04:08.120> months<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.140> is

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
answer in just two months so this is
