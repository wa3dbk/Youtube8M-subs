00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.399
 Look, we've been striking for 41 days 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 I'm 14 to 15 days camping in the mapocho 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.420
 the labor inspection declared us 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.280
 the extemporaneous projects I feel that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.469
 the same company delivered payroll 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.320
 people who could negotiate more than 220 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.850
 workers we judicial hoisted the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.269
 subject we demand the inspection of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.550
 work for not doing the snag and there are the 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.440
 courts declared themselves incompetent and 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.659
 they sent him to the appeals court and already 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.100
 we are trapped by either the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.820
 times what we have in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 against 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.490
 we are 500 families to whom 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.649
 these workers that we are without 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.990
 an unpaid peso without anything we spend the 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.369
 national holidays without anything while everyone 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.880
 chilies celebrate we are in the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.530
 street are we need everything or be 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.720
 here we have strike partner of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.899
 hunger in the companions that are below 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.460

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.920
 we are people who have given him a life 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.110
 this company is and we deserve 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.390
 that we share the utility we do not want 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 millions only one part east and that is 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.959

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.560
 freedom of association our company is 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.689
 calling 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.460
 workers who return to work but 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.229
 who lose all their years of service 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.460
 to change their union and not to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.810
 they are going to pay for the days that are outside 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 who will return in those conditions 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.369
 nobody and politicians once for 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.799
 all in 40 years have never legislated a 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.330
 law favorable to workers and all 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.710
 companies always have a pan for 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.049
 mangos have a silver lining 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.299
 letter where to stand where to bully 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.619
 to the workers because you have a 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.570
 strike process and it's in this 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 instance the company sends you letters of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.830
 warning dismissal letter and almond 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.420
 before the movement and makes 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.209
 people are losing voice strength 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.860
 because the long we have been 40 days and you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.680
 you know that without salary the accounts arrive 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.360
 equal the expenses are still here in the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 union and many mothers of families 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.440
 that are alone and sustain only the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.690
 psychologically to see that the entities 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.170
 controllable has not even helped us 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.269
 we are looking for escape routes 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.799
 in such a way to ensure the interest of 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.390
 the workers nothing more than we are 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.250
 invisible to society in these 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.079
 moments this is like a zoo the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.120
 people pass look at the little monkeys that are 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.280
