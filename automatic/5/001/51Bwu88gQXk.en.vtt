tantrum<00:00:09.530> anyway<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.950> how<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
tantrum anyway this is how to do the

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.019 
tantrum anyway this is how to do the
uneven<00:00:13.889> box<00:00:14.160> thing<00:00:15.680> really<00:00:16.680> quickly<00:00:17.190> how<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
uneven box thing really quickly how it

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.380 
uneven box thing really quickly how it
works<00:00:18.439> it's<00:00:19.439> fairly<00:00:20.310> simple<00:00:20.730> very

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
works it's fairly simple very

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.700 
works it's fairly simple very
straightforward

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
straightforward

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.130 
straightforward
it's<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:23.970> difficult<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's not really that difficult to do I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's not really that difficult to do I
mean<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> case<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> course<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.429> more

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
mean the case is of course with more

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.380 
mean the case is of course with more
complex<00:00:30.210> models<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:30.929> gonna<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> lot

as<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.540> come<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
as you can see it's come up with this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
as you can see it's come up with this
map<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.770> maybe<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.400> necessarily<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.210> most

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
map here maybe not necessarily the most

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
map here maybe not necessarily the most
efficient<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.220> can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
efficient if you take some time you can

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.999 
efficient if you take some time you can
you<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.680> little

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you know make it so that it's a little

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
you know make it so that it's a little
more<00:01:30.229> special<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> we're<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.180> over<00:01:33.390> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.029 
Photoshop right quick I'm gonna slap
some<00:02:06.859> textures<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.490> top<00:02:07.789> of<00:02:07.969> this<00:02:08.799> as<00:02:09.799> you

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
some textures on top of this as you

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.830 
some textures on top of this as you
might<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.429> aware<00:02:10.459> as<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:11.720> the

might be aware as you can see in the
regular<00:02:15.640> Wow<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.819> model<00:02:20.599> itself<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:22.190> goes<00:02:22.430> up

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
regular Wow the model itself it goes up

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.020 
regular Wow the model itself it goes up
and<00:02:23.269> down<00:02:23.299> but<00:02:23.959> as<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.190> see<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> map

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
and down but as you can see with the map

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.309 
and down but as you can see with the map
this<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.459> that's<00:02:28.459> down<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
take these these two boxes here do this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.170 
take these these two boxes here do this
I'm<00:02:37.340> gonna<00:02:37.640> slap<00:02:41.590> slop<00:02:42.590> texture<00:02:43.190> doesn't

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
I'm gonna slap slop texture doesn't

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.430 
I'm gonna slap slop texture doesn't
really<00:02:44.420> matter<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.959> particular<00:02:47.959> case

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
really matter in this particular case

if I want them to be something different
to<00:03:11.660> each<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.530> know<00:03:13.359> no<00:03:14.359> particular

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.850 

the<00:03:29.160> box<00:03:32.210> say<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:33.660> now<00:03:33.990> we<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.230> our<00:03:34.740> basic

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
the box say that now we have our basic

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580 
the box say that now we have our basic
map<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.520> again<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.510> isn't<00:03:36.750> necessarily<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
map and again this isn't necessarily the

map and again this isn't necessarily the
most<00:03:37.650> efficient<00:03:38.430> way<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:40.500> you're

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
most efficient way to do and you're

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.770 
most efficient way to do and you're
going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.430> hand<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.270> map<00:03:44.000> turns<00:03:45.000> out<00:03:45.270> now<00:03:45.720> we

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
going to hand the map turns out now we

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.390 
going to hand the map turns out now we
can<00:03:45.990> take<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.940> bam<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.680> our<00:03:50.130> text

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
can take this and bam we have our text

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:12.090 
can take this and bam we have our text
from<00:03:50.640> here<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.290> did
