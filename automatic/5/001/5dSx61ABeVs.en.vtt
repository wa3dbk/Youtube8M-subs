00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
as Atari goes this is probably one of

very much to do with he-man imagine how

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.170 
very much to do with he-man imagine how
good<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.289> he-man<00:05:48.560> game<00:05:48.949> would<00:05:49.130> be<00:05:49.159> on<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.820> Atari

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180

we've been given a lot of low ratings
this<00:06:44.280> season<00:06:44.759> so<00:06:44.969> I'm<00:06:45.210> starting<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.900> get<00:06:45.990> sick

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
this season so I'm starting to get sick

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.619 
this season so I'm starting to get sick
of<00:06:46.409> given<00:06:46.650> zeros<00:06:47.009> and<00:06:47.189> ones<00:06:47.340> i<00:06:47.729> give<00:06:48.419> this<00:06:48.569> a

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
of given zeros and ones i give this a

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.420 
of given zeros and ones i give this a
2.5<00:06:49.439> and<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:50.069> reason<00:06:50.430> is<00:06:50.610> because<00:06:51.469> it<00:06:52.469> sort<00:06:53.279> of

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
2.5 and the reason is because it sort of

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.700 
2.5 and the reason is because it sort of
is<00:06:53.580> competent<00:06:54.090> as<00:06:54.270> a<00:06:54.330> space<00:06:54.870> type<00:06:55.289> shooter

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
is competent as a space type shooter

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.519 
is competent as a space type shooter
sort<00:06:56.550> of<00:06:56.759> is<00:06:57.000> it<00:06:57.569> it's<00:06:57.810> not<00:06:57.900> really<00:06:58.199> all<00:06:58.409> that

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:58.529 
sort of is it it's not really all that

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.580 
sort of is it it's not really all that
competent<00:06:59.569> doesn't<00:07:00.569> explain<00:07:00.900> itself<00:07:01.289> well

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
competent doesn't explain itself well

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.990 
competent doesn't explain itself well
but<00:07:03.110> 2.5<00:07:04.110> especially<00:07:05.009> for<00:07:05.159> that<00:07:05.189> crazy<00:07:05.610> nice
