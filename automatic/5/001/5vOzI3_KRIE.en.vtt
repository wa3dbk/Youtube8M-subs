in the tools that Apple gives us so

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
in the tools that Apple gives us so
let's<00:01:19.200> edit<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.619> photo<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> big

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
let's edit this photo a bit the big

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550 
let's edit this photo a bit the big
thing<00:01:23.610> about<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.880> photo<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.229> sky<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
thing about this photo is the sky is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
thing about this photo is the sky is
really<00:01:26.090> blown<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.299> quite<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:29.570> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
really blown out quite a bit it's not so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.210 
really blown out quite a bit it's not so
much<00:01:30.750> detail<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.130> them

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
much detail that you can see them

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
much detail that you can see them
looking<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.820> colors<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.020> washed<00:01:34.259> out

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
looking at it as colors very washed out

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
looking at it as colors very washed out
so<00:01:34.799> we'll<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> we'll<00:01:36.119> tap<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.780> on

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so we'll do is we'll tap here on

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.039 
so we'll do is we'll tap here on
luminance<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:38.509> we're<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.600> adjust<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
luminance and we're gonna adjust the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.780 
luminance and we're gonna adjust the
curves<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:42.229> I'll<00:01:43.229> take<00:01:43.470> yellow<00:01:44.340> curves

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
curves here I'll take yellow curves

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.660 
curves here I'll take yellow curves
because<00:01:45.240> yellow<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> opposite<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> blue

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
because yellow is the opposite of blue

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.660 
because yellow is the opposite of blue
I'll<00:01:47.670> pull<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> bit

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
I'll pull that down a bit

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
I'll pull that down a bit
so<00:01:50.689> by<00:01:51.689> pulling<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> yellow<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so by pulling down the yellow which is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
so by pulling down the yellow which is
of<00:01:52.829> course<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> opposite<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> blue<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.990> really

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
of course the opposite of blue we really

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
of course the opposite of blue we really
make<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> blue<00:01:55.409> come<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> sky<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
make the blue come out in the sky of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.800 
make the blue come out in the sky of
course<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.090> want<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> apply<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
course we don't want to apply this to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
course we don't want to apply this to
the<00:01:57.840> entire<00:01:58.229> image<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> ground

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the entire image because then the ground

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.530 
the entire image because then the ground
will<00:01:59.700> look<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.030> blue

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
will look very blue

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
will look very blue
so<00:02:00.750> what<00:02:00.840> we'll<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.110> we'll<00:02:01.259> hit<00:02:01.409> our<00:02:01.469> sigh

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so what we'll do is we'll hit our sigh

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.260 
so what we'll do is we'll hit our sigh
with<00:02:02.159> mask<00:02:02.369> button<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> old

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
with mask button and now you get the old

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
with mask button and now you get the old
tools<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.829> until<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> storm<00:02:08.459> 1<00:02:08.640> from

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
tools that we had until the storm 1 from

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.090 
tools that we had until the storm 1 from
asking<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> first<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.879> brush<00:02:12.209> then

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
asking so first one here is brush then

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.810 
asking so first one here is brush then
color<00:02:13.340> range<00:02:13.640> mode<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:16.160> gradient<00:02:16.400> tool

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
color range mode and the gradient tool

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.870 
color range mode and the gradient tool
and<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.960> eraser<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> bottom<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.720> just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
and the eraser and on the bottom is just

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.400 
and the eraser and on the bottom is just
for<00:02:22.880> scrolling<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.140> zooming<00:02:26.260> let's<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
for scrolling and zooming let's go to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.130 
for scrolling and zooming let's go to
the<00:02:27.530> brush<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:28.100> can<00:02:28.670> take<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> big<00:02:29.180> brush<00:02:29.420> then

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the brush I can take a big brush then

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
the brush I can take a big brush then
you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.650> apply<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.820> adjustment<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
you can just apply that adjustment to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.290 
you can just apply that adjustment to
the<00:02:35.570> sky<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.670> go<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.820> little<00:02:38.000> overboard

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
the sky and if you go a little overboard

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.050 
the sky and if you go a little overboard
you<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.080> down<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.740> eraser<00:02:40.130> just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
you can go down here to the eraser just

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.610 
you can go down here to the eraser just
erase<00:02:41.960> what<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.260> did

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
erase what you did

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.300 
erase what you did
that<00:02:43.610> works<00:02:43.790> quite<00:02:43.910> well<00:02:44.740> if<00:02:45.740> we<00:02:46.010> want<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
that works quite well if we want to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.940 
that works quite well if we want to
approve<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.570> change<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.290> apply<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
image you can hit this check check box

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.550 
image you can hit this check check box
and<00:02:52.640> if<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.150> don't<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.480> what<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:53.630> did<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:54.440> can

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and if we don't like what we did we can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.470 
and if we don't like what we did we can
hit<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.830> sex<00:02:55.070> I'm<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.970> hit<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.150> X<00:02:56.300> right

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
hit the sex I'm going to hit the X right

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.820 
hit the sex I'm going to hit the X right
now<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:57.020> show<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.740> with

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
now so I can show you how to do it with

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.770 
now so I can show you how to do it with
a<00:02:57.860> different<00:02:58.010> tool<00:02:58.870> go<00:02:59.870> back<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:01.660> pull<00:03:02.660> that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
a different tool go back and pull that

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
a different tool go back and pull that
down<00:03:02.840> again<00:03:04.000> slide<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.180> masks<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:06.680> could

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
down again slide with masks so we could

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.850 
down again slide with masks so we could
also<00:03:06.950> use<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.880> color<00:03:08.120> range<00:03:08.270> selector<00:03:08.860> what

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
also use the color range selector what

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.980 
also use the color range selector what
happens<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.360> looking<00:03:11.570> at<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> color

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
happens is this is looking at the color

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.770 
happens is this is looking at the color
that's<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.650> under<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.640> little<00:03:14.120> loop<00:03:14.750> here

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
that's right under this little loop here

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.350 
that's right under this little loop here
so<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:16.040> loops<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.490> top<00:03:16.520> of<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.790> tree<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.210> so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
so this loops on top of a tree here so

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.580 
so this loops on top of a tree here so
what<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:17.630> doing<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.960> its<00:03:18.170> selecting

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
what it's doing is its selecting

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.300 
what it's doing is its selecting
everything<00:03:18.830> that's<00:03:19.160> green<00:03:19.460> like<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.880> tree

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
everything that's green like the tree

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.220 
everything that's green like the tree
and<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.550> showing<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.910> as<00:03:23.150> white<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.080> that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
and it's showing that as white and that

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.110 
and it's showing that as white and that
white<00:03:24.500> area<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:25.070> where<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.640> adjustment<00:03:26.060> will

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
white area is where the adjustment will

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.900 
white area is where the adjustment will
be<00:03:26.180> applied<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> since<00:03:28.460> we<00:03:28.550> want<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.760> apply

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
be applied to so since we want to apply

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.000 
be applied to so since we want to apply
to<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> sky<00:03:29.420> we'll<00:03:30.170> move<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.500> loop<00:03:30.620> over<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
to the sky we'll move the loop over to

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.150 
to the sky we'll move the loop over to
the<00:03:31.100> sky<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.870> see<00:03:33.080> now<00:03:33.260> we're<00:03:34.010> also

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
the sky but you can see now we're also

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.580 
the sky but you can see now we're also
selecting<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.910> bunch<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.780> area<00:03:36.080> down<00:03:36.230> here

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
selecting a bunch of this area down here

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.720 
selecting a bunch of this area down here
and<00:03:36.710> it's<00:03:36.800> becoming<00:03:37.040> blue<00:03:37.280> which<00:03:37.400> we<00:03:37.520> don't

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
and it's becoming blue which we don't

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.970 
and it's becoming blue which we don't
want<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.390> can<00:03:38.480> pull<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> range<00:03:39.080> back<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.830> it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
want we can pull the range back so it

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.810 
want we can pull the range back so it
selects<00:03:40.280> less<00:03:42.070> well<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.190> know<00:03:43.340> we're<00:03:43.670> never

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
selects less well you know we're never

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.370 
selects less well you know we're never
going<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.150> quite<00:03:44.480> get<00:03:44.750> rid<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.930> all<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
going to quite get rid of all of the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.840 
going to quite get rid of all of the
grounds<00:03:45.800> but<00:03:46.070> that's<00:03:46.280> okay

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
grounds but that's okay

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.700 
grounds but that's okay
we<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.660> tap<00:03:48.260> here<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.590> add<00:03:48.980> this<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.400> mask

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
we can tap here to add this to the mask

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.190 
we can tap here to add this to the mask
and<00:03:51.710> then<00:03:52.040> we<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.370> again<00:03:52.640> use<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.060> eraser<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
and then we can again use the eraser to

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.230 
and then we can again use the eraser to
just<00:03:56.620> get<00:03:57.620> rid<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.070> extra<00:03:58.340> areas<00:03:58.820> that<00:03:59.090> we

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
just get rid of the extra areas that we

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.120 
just get rid of the extra areas that we
didn't<00:03:59.540> want<00:03:59.780> to<00:04:00.020> actually<00:04:00.200> change<00:04:02.800> I'm<00:04:03.800> going

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
didn't want to actually change I'm going

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.950 
didn't want to actually change I'm going
to<00:04:04.220> again<00:04:04.460> a<00:04:04.520> councilís<00:04:05.210> so<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.510> can<00:04:05.690> show<00:04:05.870> you

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
to again a councilís so I can show you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.490 
to again a councilís so I can show you
the<00:04:06.080> gradient<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:09.310> let's<00:04:10.310> go<00:04:10.460> back<00:04:11.380> pull<00:04:12.380> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
the gradient so let's go back pull this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.400 
the gradient so let's go back pull this
down<00:04:12.680> again<00:04:13.040> get<00:04:13.400> nice<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.610> blue<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:15.110> apply

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
down again get nice and blue and apply

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.800 
down again get nice and blue and apply
with<00:04:15.560> mask<00:04:15.770> again<00:04:16.040> this<00:04:17.030> time<00:04:17.330> we'll<00:04:17.600> go<00:04:17.750> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
with mask again this time we'll go to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.909 
with mask again this time we'll go to
the<00:04:18.590> gradient<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.840> these<00:04:21.620> two<00:04:23.919> two

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
the gradient so you have these two two

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.409 
the gradient so you have these two two
knobs<00:04:25.190> basically<00:04:25.850> that<00:04:26.000> define<00:04:26.270> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
knobs basically that define the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:26.860 
knobs basically that define the
beginning

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
beginning

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.570 
beginning
the<00:04:27.050> endpoint<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.590> gradient<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.130> can<00:04:28.310> see

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the endpoint in the gradient you can see

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.990 
the endpoint in the gradient you can see
it<00:04:28.940> previews<00:04:29.389> this<00:04:29.540> blue<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:31.760> set<00:04:31.880> the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
it previews this blue just set the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.969 
it previews this blue just set the
gradient<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:32.419> this<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:35.050> it'll<00:04:36.050> apply<00:04:36.350> to

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
gradient like this and it'll apply to

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.270 
gradient like this and it'll apply to
that<00:04:37.100> area<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:37.820> also<00:04:37.850> make<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:39.280> radial

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
that area you can also make it a radial

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.430 
that area you can also make it a radial
gradient<00:04:42.460> either<00:04:43.460> way<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:45.080> really<00:04:45.410> just

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
gradient either way but we really just

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.740 
gradient either way but we really just
want<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.010> do<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.340> linearly<00:04:46.880> right<00:04:47.210> now<00:04:47.389> so

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
want to do this linearly right now so

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.870 
want to do this linearly right now so
we'll<00:04:48.710> do<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:52.310> can<00:04:52.430> add<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.820> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
we'll do that you can add that to the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.840 
we'll do that you can add that to the
mask<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.860> it's<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.919> good<00:04:55.130> change<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.510> will

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
mask and it's a good change so I will

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.689 
mask and it's a good change so I will
prove<00:04:58.850> it<00:05:00.010> now<00:05:01.010> there's<00:05:01.190> more<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:01.460> could<00:05:01.550> do<00:05:01.669> to

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
prove it now there's more we could do to

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.240 
prove it now there's more we could do to
this<00:05:01.910> image<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.630> can<00:05:02.919> lighten<00:05:03.919> up<00:05:04.100> these

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
this image you can lighten up these

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.159 
this image you can lighten up these
buildings<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.820> bit<00:05:04.970> make<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.180> look<00:05:05.300> look<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:06.020> bit

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
buildings a bit make it look look a bit

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.430 
buildings a bit make it look look a bit
sunnier<00:05:06.470> we'll<00:05:07.130> come<00:05:07.370> back<00:05:07.550> here's<00:05:07.880> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
sunnier we'll come back here's the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.110 
sunnier we'll come back here's the
luminance<00:05:09.440> brighten<00:05:10.039> things<00:05:10.280> up<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.699> bit

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.529 

there's<00:05:17.120> some<00:05:17.240> contrast<00:05:19.090> can<00:05:20.090> apply<00:05:20.479> with

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
there's some contrast can apply with

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.719 
there's some contrast can apply with
math<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:21.020> time<00:05:21.260> we're<00:05:21.440> just<00:05:21.470> going<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.130> go

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
math this time we're just going to go

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.060 
math this time we're just going to go
ahead<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.120> use<00:05:23.240> a<00:05:23.270> brush<00:05:23.660> because<00:05:24.260> it's<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
ahead and use a brush because it's the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.120 
ahead and use a brush because it's the
best<00:05:25.250> way<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.600> just<00:05:26.600> kind<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:26.990> drag<00:05:27.380> or<00:05:27.740> along

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
best way to just kind of drag or along

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.940 
best way to just kind of drag or along
here<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.729> lighten<00:05:29.150> that<00:05:29.300> up<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:33.440> looks<00:05:33.680> good

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
here and lighten that up that looks good

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.330 
here and lighten that up that looks good
we<00:05:34.880> can<00:05:35.000> also<00:05:35.180> make<00:05:35.389> the<00:05:35.539> trees<00:05:35.780> look<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.080> bit

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
we can also make the trees look a bit

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.900 
we can also make the trees look a bit
livelier<00:05:37.360> give<00:05:38.360> some<00:05:38.599> contrast<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.380> area

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.500 

now<00:05:47.020> go<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:49.460> again<00:05:49.700> we'll<00:05:49.849> just<00:05:49.880> take<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.240> brush

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
now go and again we'll just take a brush

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.740 
now go and again we'll just take a brush
and<00:05:50.570> real<00:05:50.960> tap<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.099> drag<00:05:52.280> around<00:05:52.849> here<00:05:53.360> to

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
and real tap and drag around here to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.469 
and real tap and drag around here to
make<00:05:53.900> that<00:05:54.200> bit<00:05:54.680> contrast<00:05:55.280> here<00:05:58.270> let's<00:05:59.270> add

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
make that bit contrast here let's add

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.580 
make that bit contrast here let's add
that<00:05:59.630> over<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:03.669> there<00:06:04.669> we<00:06:04.789> go<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:04.970> like<00:06:05.360> that

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
that over to there we go I like that

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.339 
that over to there we go I like that
great<00:06:08.199> now<00:06:09.639> we<00:06:10.639> can<00:06:10.789> come<00:06:11.360> tap<00:06:11.599> up<00:06:11.750> here<00:06:11.990> to<00:06:12.260> get

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
great now we can come tap up here to get

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.140 
great now we can come tap up here to get
to<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.530> export<00:06:12.949> menu<00:06:13.070> this<00:06:13.669> looks<00:06:13.910> quite<00:06:14.120> a

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
to the export menu this looks quite a

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.879 
to the export menu this looks quite a
bit<00:06:14.300> different<00:06:14.630> than<00:06:14.660> in<00:06:15.020> filters<00:06:15.470> storm<00:06:15.710> one

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
bit different than in filters storm one

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.980 
bit different than in filters storm one
because<00:06:16.220> now<00:06:16.370> we<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.669> this<00:06:16.880> ability<00:06:17.750> to

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
because now we have this ability to

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.890 
because now we have this ability to
export<00:06:18.320> large<00:06:19.210> now<00:06:20.210> what<00:06:20.419> we're<00:06:20.570> normally

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
export large now what we're normally

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.480 
export large now what we're normally
working<00:06:21.199> on<00:06:21.289> here<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:21.860> an<00:06:22.039> image<00:06:22.220> that's<00:06:22.370> been

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
working on here is an image that's been

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.310 
working on here is an image that's been
scaled<00:06:22.820> down<00:06:22.910> to<00:06:23.030> 1800<00:06:23.720> pics<00:06:23.900> on<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.169> long

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
scaled down to 1800 pics on the long

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.310 
scaled down to 1800 pics on the long
side<00:06:25.150> but<00:06:26.150> what<00:06:26.300> we<00:06:26.389> do<00:06:26.539> when<00:06:26.720> we<00:06:26.840> select

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
side but what we do when we select

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.879 
side but what we do when we select
export<00:06:27.740> large<00:06:27.949> is<00:06:28.270> we'll<00:06:29.270> bring<00:06:30.229> in<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.680> full

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
export large is we'll bring in the full

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.339 
export large is we'll bring in the full
sized<00:06:31.130> image<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.760> filter<00:06:32.660> storms<00:06:32.960> this<00:06:33.110> one

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
sized image and filter storms this one

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.600 
sized image and filter storms this one
time<00:06:33.530> when<00:06:33.740> recording<00:06:34.070> what<00:06:34.370> you've<00:06:34.490> been

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
time when recording what you've been

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.640 
time when recording what you've been
doing<00:06:34.880> to<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.120> image<00:06:35.240> so<00:06:35.990> it'll<00:06:36.140> go<00:06:36.380> and<00:06:36.560> it

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
doing to the image so it'll go and it

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.620 
doing to the image so it'll go and it
will<00:06:36.710> reapply<00:06:37.700> all<00:06:37.909> of<00:06:38.030> your<00:06:38.180> edits<00:06:38.419> to<00:06:38.539> the

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
will reapply all of your edits to the

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.120 
will reapply all of your edits to the
full<00:06:38.840> sized<00:06:39.080> image

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
full sized image

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.530 
full sized image
so<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:40.370> can<00:06:40.690> save<00:06:41.690> two<00:06:41.870> photos<00:06:42.170> now<00:06:43.000> so<00:06:44.000> it

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
so you can save two photos now so it

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.840 
so you can save two photos now so it
gives<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.840> this<00:06:45.020> progress<00:06:45.710> indicator<00:06:46.160> that

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
gives you this progress indicator that

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.610 
gives you this progress indicator that
goes<00:06:47.030> ahead<00:06:47.180> and<00:06:47.480> it<00:06:47.570> reapplies<00:06:48.020> everything<00:06:48.530> I

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
goes ahead and it reapplies everything I

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.030 
goes ahead and it reapplies everything I
did<00:06:48.830> to<00:06:49.790> be<00:06:49.940> full<00:06:50.180> image<00:06:50.480> now<00:06:51.260> this<00:06:51.620> is<00:06:51.740> rubbing

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
did to be full image now this is rubbing

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.650 
did to be full image now this is rubbing
on<00:06:52.160> the<00:06:52.250> simulator<00:06:52.670> here<00:06:52.730> so<00:06:53.120> the<00:06:53.240> actual

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
on the simulator here so the actual

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.620 
on the simulator here so the actual
speed<00:06:54.050> on<00:06:54.170> the<00:06:54.260> iPad<00:06:54.590> will<00:06:54.740> by<00:06:54.890> the<00:06:55.390> half<00:06:56.390> that

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
speed on the iPad will by the half that

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.490 
speed on the iPad will by the half that
may<00:06:57.020> be<00:06:57.080> a<00:06:57.170> bit<00:06:57.350> slower<00:06:58.240> but<00:06:59.240> it's<00:07:00.110> still<00:07:00.290> quite

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
may be a bit slower but it's still quite

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.070 
may be a bit slower but it's still quite
useful<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:02.060> when<00:07:02.270> it's<00:07:02.390> done<00:07:02.510> it'll<00:07:02.840> just

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
useful and when it's done it'll just

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.020 
useful and when it's done it'll just
bring<00:07:03.230> the<00:07:03.350> photo<00:07:03.560> right<00:07:03.800> back<00:07:03.950> in<00:07:07.030> and

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
bring the photo right back in and

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.320 
bring the photo right back in and
there's<00:07:08.420> our<00:07:08.810> quick<00:07:09.620> first<00:07:10.010> tour<00:07:10.460> of<00:07:10.490> the

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
there's our quick first tour of the

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.650 
there's our quick first tour of the
interface<00:07:11.660> and<00:07:11.690> filter<00:07:12.110> storm<00:07:12.380> to
