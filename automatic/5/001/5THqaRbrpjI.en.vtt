00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so I just recorded me doing some three

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
so I just recorded me doing some three
by<00:00:43.170> three<00:00:43.440> selves<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.160> ended<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.399> getting

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
by three selves and I ended up getting

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
by three selves and I ended up getting
close<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:46.020> new<00:00:46.140> record<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.739> well

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.220 
after my records like a 19-point one so
that<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.840> close<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.649> um<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.449> like

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
i'm off work so i'll end up making one

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
i'm off work so i'll end up making one
for<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> while

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
for that that's gonna take a while

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
for that that's gonna take a while
though<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.770> planned<00:01:13.979> out

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
though because i have it all planned out

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.630 
though because i have it all planned out
it's<00:01:14.340> gonna<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.640> six<00:01:15.030> parts<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.640> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it's gonna be about six parts and it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.850 
it's gonna be about six parts and it's
not<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.090> solving<00:01:18.960> cube<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.350> hard<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
not that solving cube is hard it's just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.030 
not that solving cube is hard it's just
there's<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> things<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> know

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
there's a lot of things you have to know

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's a lot of things you have to know
so<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.070> find<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> hard<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> split<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so i find it hard to split it up into a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
so i find it hard to split it up into a
bunch<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> videos<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:26.070> like

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
bunch of videos and kind of say like

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
bunch of videos and kind of say like
master<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> before<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> next

master this before you go on to the next

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
master this before you go on to the next
video<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> work<00:01:29.189> better<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.479> guys

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
actually makes me really happy so the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.219 
actually makes me really happy so the
four-by-four<00:01:50.850> solve<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.659> wrapping<00:01:52.110> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
four-by-four solve is just wrapping up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.690 
four-by-four solve is just wrapping up
here<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.049> finished<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> set

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
here we go I just finished it so I set

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
here we go I just finished it so I set
it<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.240> happily<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.560> turn<00:01:59.070> off

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it down all happily and then turn off

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880 
it down all happily and then turn off
the<00:01:59.219> recording<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the recording and then I just have the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.800 
the recording and then I just have the
three<00:02:02.159> by<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:02.520> solve<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.420> guess

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
three by three solve here which I guess

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.060 
three by three solve here which I guess
this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.140> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> show<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.710> guys<00:02:04.890> what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this is just kind of show you guys what

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
this is just kind of show you guys what
one<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> my<00:02:05.340> faster<00:02:05.790> ones<00:02:05.969> would<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
one of my faster ones would be I I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.270 
one of my faster ones would be I I
wasn't<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.079> planning<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.649> uploading<00:02:08.009> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
wasn't really planning on uploading this

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.580 
wasn't really planning on uploading this
I<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.509> was<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.869> 10th<00:02:10.229> solve

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I was just this was like the 10th solve

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.910 
I was just this was like the 10th solve
probably<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
probably the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.270 
probably the
session<00:02:12.550> or<00:02:12.670> whatever<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.830> yeah<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.010> anyways

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
session or whatever but yeah so anyways

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.580 
session or whatever but yeah so anyways
that's<00:02:15.430> that's<00:02:15.910> pretty<00:02:16.000> well<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.420> um<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.560> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that's that's pretty well that um so I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.130 
that's that's pretty well that um so I
hope<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.830> guys<00:02:17.890> enjoyed<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.340> video<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.140> you
