00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
goal and yeah that's because I put in

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259 
goal and yeah that's because I put in
the<00:00:25.920> goal<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.699> obviously<00:00:26.939> like

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the goal to make it obviously like

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
the goal to make it obviously like
really<00:00:27.630> realistic<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.439> possible<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.429> that

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
really realistic as possible so that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
really realistic as possible so that
obviously<00:00:29.820> Chris<00:00:30.300> Resnick<00:00:30.660> did<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.170> top

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
obviously Chris Resnick did get some top

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.319 
obviously Chris Resnick did get some top
of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.710> game<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> Titan<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.790> more

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
of the first game so Titan will more

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.690 
of the first game so Titan will more
than<00:00:33.420> likely<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.780> played<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.250> put

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
than likely be played and I also put

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.750 
than likely be played and I also put
puffle<00:00:36.329> thnk<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:37.050> front<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.590> Russia<00:00:38.190> instead

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
puffle thnk up front for Russia instead

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.090 
puffle thnk up front for Russia instead
of<00:00:38.969> carriage<00:00:39.660> cove<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.710> purely

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
of carriage cove that is because purely

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
of carriage cove that is because purely
if<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> manager<00:00:41.969> i<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.360> i<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.629> put

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
if I was the manager i would i would put

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
if I was the manager i would i would put
popular<00:00:43.379> drinkable<00:00:43.829> front<00:00:44.040> instead<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
popular drinkable front instead of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.860 
popular drinkable front instead of
ketchup<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> major<00:00:45.210> tony<00:00:45.510> kadjic

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
ketchup of you and a major tony kadjic

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
ketchup of you and a major tony kadjic
have<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.440> absolute<00:00:46.800> nightmare<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:48.000> yet

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
have had an absolute nightmare and yet

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
have had an absolute nightmare and yet
probably<00:00:48.360> drink<00:00:48.660> okay<00:00:48.870> mom<00:00:49.020> did<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.440> well

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
probably drink okay mom did really well

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
probably drink okay mom did really well
so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> mean<00:00:50.370> obviously<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> say<00:00:51.149> it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
so I mean obviously you can say it's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
so I mean obviously you can say it's
harsh<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> cash<00:00:51.840> cockpit<00:00:52.320> ultimately<00:00:52.829> you've

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
harsh and cash cockpit ultimately you've

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.619 
harsh and cash cockpit ultimately you've
got<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> try<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.789> win<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> tournament<00:00:54.390> unya

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
got to try and win the tournament unya

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
got to try and win the tournament unya
so<00:00:54.750> yeah<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.250> into<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> actual<00:00:56.940> game

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
so yeah it will go into the actual game

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
so yeah it will go into the actual game
now<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> obviously<00:00:58.010> Poland<00:00:59.010> drew<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.309> mama

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
now and obviously Poland drew on mama

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
now and obviously Poland drew on mama
Greece<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> first<00:01:00.390> game<00:01:00.539> which<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
Greece in the first game which for me I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
Greece in the first game which for me I
was<00:01:01.649> quite<00:01:01.920> surprised<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> thought<00:01:02.640> pulling

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
was quite surprised I thought pulling

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
was quite surprised I thought pulling
the<00:01:03.120> winner<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.930> Russia<00:01:04.290> went<00:01:04.559> an

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the winner and then Russia went an

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
the winner and then Russia went an
absolutely<00:01:04.979> thrashed<00:01:05.519> czech<00:01:05.880> republic<00:01:06.270> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
absolutely thrashed czech republic I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
absolutely thrashed czech republic I
thought<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> closer<00:01:07.619> game<00:01:07.710> than

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
thought it would be a closer game than

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200 
thought it would be a closer game than
what<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> thought<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.670> might<00:01:08.939> come<00:01:09.090> out

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
what it was I thought we might come out

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
what it was I thought we might come out
with<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> mag<00:01:09.840> moat<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> victory<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
with the mag moat with a victory but the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
with the mag moat with a victory but the
ways<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> thrashman<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.360> really

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
ways in which the thrashman was really

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.969 
ways in which the thrashman was really
you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.020> nice<00:01:13.439> football<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you know really nice football and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.320 
you know really nice football and
couldn't<00:01:14.520> deal<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.670> him<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:14.970> times<00:01:15.090> with

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
couldn't deal with him at times with

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
couldn't deal with him at times with
Jack<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.009> all<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.189> said<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
Jack see so all that I said this is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
Jack see so all that I said this is
probably<00:01:17.850> gonna<00:01:18.000> sound<00:01:18.240> odd<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> say<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
probably gonna sound odd when I say that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
probably gonna sound odd when I say that
I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> 1-1<00:01:20.220> draw<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> said

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I think it will be a 1-1 draw and I said

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.420 
I think it will be a 1-1 draw and I said
that<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> last<00:01:21.570> game<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:23.250> group

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that in the last game for this group

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090 
that in the last game for this group
which<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.640> Greece<00:01:24.150> first<00:01:24.479> said<00:01:25.100> czech

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
which was Greece first said czech

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
reason another weren't brilliant against

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
reason another weren't brilliant against
greece<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.630> easily<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
greece and they could have easily and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
greece and they could have easily and
probably<00:01:37.650> should<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:37.979> done<00:01:38.189> better<00:01:38.670> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
probably should have done better but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
probably should have done better but
yeah<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> mean<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.619> stick<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:40.860> my

yeah I mean I'm gonna stick with my

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
yeah I mean I'm gonna stick with my
prediction<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.150> mum<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.649> saw<00:01:43.799> there

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
prediction of a mum and as you saw there

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.410 
prediction of a mum and as you saw there
in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> last<00:01:44.340> clip<00:01:44.549> Roland<00:01:45.000> did<00:01:45.119> try<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
in the last clip Roland did try and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539 
in the last clip Roland did try and
break<00:01:45.540> Russia<00:01:45.750> down<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> actual<00:01:46.619> gameplay

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
break Russia down in the actual gameplay

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.010 
break Russia down in the actual gameplay
but<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.479> couldn't<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
but they just they just couldn't get the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
but they just they just couldn't get the
ball<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> box<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.100> could<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.460> find

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ball into the box they could really find

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
ball into the box they could really find
that<00:01:50.729> equalizing<00:01:51.240> goal<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.140> they

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that equalizing goal but I think they

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
that equalizing goal but I think they
will<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.500> able<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> run<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> equalizing<00:01:53.490> also

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
will be able to run the equalizing also

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
will be able to run the equalizing also
