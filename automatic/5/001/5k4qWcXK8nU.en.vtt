00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
of the alternator and I can get my pry

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.440 
of the alternator and I can get my pry
bar<00:02:18.239> up<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.220> probably<00:02:20.489> can<00:02:20.850> too<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
bar up here and you probably can too and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.070 
bar up here and you probably can too and
I<00:02:21.630> was<00:02:21.750> gonna<00:02:21.959> pry<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.319> way<00:02:26.660> pick<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.810> belt

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
I was gonna pry this way pick that belt

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.899 
I was gonna pry this way pick that belt
to<00:02:28.230> tighten<00:02:28.560> up

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.429 

you<00:02:33.909> privy<00:02:34.150> back<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.780> continue<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> pry

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
you privy back there and continue to pry

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:45.670 
you privy back there and continue to pry
on<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.689> it's<00:02:37.689> actually<00:02:37.959> not<00:02:38.500> too<00:02:38.739> bad<00:02:38.950> there

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920 

that's<00:02:46.250> probably<00:02:46.549> about<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:46.879> much<00:02:47.060> free<00:02:47.689> play

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's probably about as much free play

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.949 
that's probably about as much free play
as<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.200> want

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.440 

I'll<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.440> needed<00:02:54.740> put<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.100> camera<00:02:55.880> down<00:02:55.910> but

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
I'll be needed put the camera down but

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.390 
I'll be needed put the camera down but
we'll<00:02:56.660> put<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> pry<00:02:57.620> bar<00:02:57.860> back<00:02:58.040> where<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.370> was

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
we'll put the pry bar back where it was

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.790 
we'll put the pry bar back where it was
and<00:02:58.550> pry<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.330> bit<00:02:59.450> hold<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.410> steady

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
and pry a little bit hold it steady

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.980 
and pry a little bit hold it steady
and<00:03:01.010> tighten<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.819> 14<00:03:02.330> millimeter<00:03:02.750> bolt

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and tighten up that 14 millimeter bolt

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.800 
and tighten up that 14 millimeter bolt
while<00:03:03.319> we're<00:03:03.590> holding<00:03:03.740> pressure<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:05.150> the

tightening<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.590> bolts<00:03:10.370> which<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.940> happen

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.130 

tighten<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.080> belt<00:03:19.720> tighten<00:03:20.720> up<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.930> bolt

tighten up the belt tighten up the bolt
and<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.130> should<00:03:22.280> be<00:03:22.370> good<00:03:22.550> I'm<00:03:23.240> gonna<00:03:23.480> see<00:03:23.660> that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
and it should be good I'm gonna see that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.270 
and it should be good I'm gonna see that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
diagram of the routing of the belt so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.750 
diagram of the routing of the belt so
yours<00:03:43.220> might<00:03:43.280> vary<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.880> little<00:03:44.120> bit<00:03:45.610> since<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
yours might vary a little bit since I

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.250 
yours might vary a little bit since I
was<00:03:46.910> already<00:03:47.060> kind<00:03:47.270> of<00:03:47.360> down<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.960> do<00:03:48.080> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
was already kind of down here to do the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.020 
was already kind of down here to do the
power<00:03:48.470> stream<00:03:48.800> belt<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.400> thought<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.790> might<00:03:49.910> be

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
power stream belt I thought it might be

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.600 
power stream belt I thought it might be
easier<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.300> do<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.570> down<00:03:50.690> here<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.370> we<00:03:52.370> got<00:03:52.520> the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
easier to do it down here so we got the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.600 
easier to do it down here so we got the
belt<00:03:52.820> coming<00:03:53.180> around<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:54.310> alternator<00:03:55.310> up

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
belt coming around the alternator up

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.580 
belt coming around the alternator up
there<00:03:55.850> then<00:03:56.150> around<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.810> water<00:03:56.990> pump<00:03:57.290> here

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
there then around the water pump here

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.380 
there then around the water pump here
and<00:03:57.890> then<00:03:58.070> down<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.490> around<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.000> back<00:03:59.030> up

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
and then down and around and back up

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.740 
and then down and around and back up
around<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.530> straight<00:04:00.890> up<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.250> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
around here straight up to the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.570 
around here straight up to the
alternator<00:04:02.750> which<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.260> loose<00:04:03.500> plenty<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.070> free

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
alternator which is loose plenty of free

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.840 
alternator which is loose plenty of free
play<00:04:04.820> here<00:04:05.030> actually<00:04:05.210> so<00:04:06.430> go<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.520> top<00:04:07.790> and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
play here actually so go up top and

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.730 
play here actually so go up top and
tighten<00:04:08.480> up<00:04:08.630> on<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.870> bolt<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.590> see

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
tighten up on the bolt and you can see

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.490 
tighten up on the bolt and you can see
how<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:09.950> tighten<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.580> loosen<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:11.090> belt<00:04:11.500> when

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
how to tighten and loosen this belt when

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.410 
how to tighten and loosen this belt when
we<00:04:12.620> get<00:04:12.740> up<00:04:12.860> there<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.910> here's<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.150> good<00:04:14.270> look

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
we get up there so here's a good look

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.030 
we get up there so here's a good look
from<00:04:14.660> down<00:04:14.930> below

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.220 

here<00:04:18.700> we<00:04:18.820> are<00:04:18.850> 12<00:04:19.270> millimeter<00:04:19.720> bolt<00:04:19.960> here<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
here we are 12 millimeter bolt here and

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.080 
here we are 12 millimeter bolt here and
12<00:04:20.740> millimeter<00:04:21.160> knot<00:04:21.370> here<00:04:21.670> if<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.910> want<00:04:22.060> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
12 millimeter knot here if you want to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.810 
12 millimeter knot here if you want to
loosen<00:04:22.450> this<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.690> can<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.770> makes<00:04:24.040> pivoting

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
loosen this you can it makes pivoting

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.390 
loosen this you can it makes pivoting
this<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.090> little<00:04:25.300> easier

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
this a little easier

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.030 
this a little easier
I<00:04:27.430> used<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:28.030> pry<00:04:28.270> bar<00:04:28.510> right<00:04:29.110> here<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.530> pushed

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
I used a pry bar right here and pushed

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.170 
I used a pry bar right here and pushed
on<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.340> alternator<00:04:31.110> egoistical<00:04:32.110> backwards

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180

friend-like

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
friend-like

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.149

so pretty much right there we'll just
hold<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.520> tight<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:05.490> then<00:05:06.490> we'll<00:05:06.610> tighten

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
hold this tight and then we'll tighten

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.749 
hold this tight and then we'll tighten
that<00:05:07.000> twelve<00:05:07.240> millimeter<00:05:07.419> bolt<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:09.550> we'll

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
that twelve millimeter bolt and we'll

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.300 
that twelve millimeter bolt and we'll
take<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.090> tension<00:05:10.300> maybe<00:05:10.659> down<00:05:11.560> below<00:05:11.889> or<00:05:12.220> we

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
take the tension maybe down below or we

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:23.929 
take the tension maybe down below or we
can<00:05:12.430> reach<00:05:12.550> over<00:05:12.789> here

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.549 

check<00:05:24.939> the<00:05:25.059> tension<00:05:25.419> right<00:05:25.809> there<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:26.439> I'm

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:26.559 
check the tension right there so I'm

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.339 
check the tension right there so I'm
gonna<00:05:26.819> put<00:05:27.819> the<00:05:27.939> camera<00:05:28.120> down<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.779> sign<00:05:29.229> up

the squeal goes away and most of the
time<00:07:01.530> that'll<00:07:01.830> take<00:07:01.980> care<00:07:02.010> of<00:07:02.250> any<00:07:02.460> issues

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
through place in the belt because maybe

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.120 
through place in the belt because maybe
I<00:07:07.740> wasn't<00:07:08.280> tight<00:07:08.580> enough<00:07:08.610> so<00:07:09.860> I<00:07:10.860> hope<00:07:10.950> this

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
I wasn't tight enough so I hope this
