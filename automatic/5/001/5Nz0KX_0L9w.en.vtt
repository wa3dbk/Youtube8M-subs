super<00:01:12.619> easy<00:01:15.399> it's<00:01:17.560> 10,000<00:01:18.560> steps<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:18.979> day<00:01:20.799> six

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
super easy it's 10,000 steps a day six

meals a day 200 calories each wait till

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.569 
meals a day 200 calories each wait till
you<00:01:27.799> reach<00:01:27.979> ketosis<00:01:29.289> which<00:01:30.369> should<00:01:31.369> in

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
you reach ketosis which should in

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.559 
you reach ketosis which should in
general<00:01:32.030> take<00:01:32.360> three<00:01:32.750> days<00:01:34.030> after<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.299> the

a<00:01:44.689> day<00:01:46.149> super<00:01:47.149> important<00:01:47.860> you're<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.280> be

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
a day super important you're going to be

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.169 
a day super important you're going to be
eating<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.649> lot<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:52.009> protein<00:01:52.429> to<00:01:52.670> get<00:01:52.789> to<00:01:52.969> that

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
eating a lot of protein to get to that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.469 
eating a lot of protein to get to that
ketosis<00:01:53.689> state<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.469> you<00:01:55.069> need<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:56.329> your

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
ketosis state and you need all of your

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.990 
ketosis state and you need all of your
organs<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.319> be<00:01:57.530> cleared<00:01:59.020> regularly<00:02:00.020> and

naturally so we're simple 20,000 fat I'm

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.610 
naturally so we're simple 20,000 fat I'm
still<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.379> time<00:02:13.370> reach<00:02:13.549> 120<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.720> little

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
still going time reach 120 for a little

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.770 
still going time reach 120 for a little
bit<00:02:15.799> more<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.810> will<00:02:18.560> check<00:02:18.769> in<00:02:20.620> once<00:02:21.620> again<00:02:21.769> oh

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
bit more I will check in once again oh

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.259 
bit more I will check in once again oh
by<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.810> way<00:02:24.819> no<00:02:25.819> steadily<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.120> see

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
by the way no steadily what can you see

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.979 
by the way no steadily what can you see
that<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.599> can't<00:02:29.840> see<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:48.910 

also<00:02:35.989> some<00:02:36.799> flexibility<00:02:37.459> comes<00:02:37.670> back<00:02:37.879> to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.610

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
anyway you get the picture try the time

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.460 
anyway you get the picture try the time
goes<00:02:57.860> by<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.099> quick<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:59.660> keep<00:02:59.930> putting<00:03:00.349> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
goes by so quick if you keep putting it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.860 
goes by so quick if you keep putting it
off<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.270> big<00:03:02.770> you'll<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:03.920> unhealthy

off just a big you'll be unhealthy

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.990 
off just a big you'll be unhealthy
you'll<00:03:05.870> get<00:03:05.989> bigger<00:03:06.670> you'll<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.819> more

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you'll get bigger you'll get more

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.350 
you'll get bigger you'll get more

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
depressed and it will be that much

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.620
