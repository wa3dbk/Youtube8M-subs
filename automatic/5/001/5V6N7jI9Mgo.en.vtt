so I was I was killing uh some cubed

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.540 
so I was I was killing uh some cubed
ease<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.880> cubed<00:00:27.869> II<00:00:27.960> was<00:00:28.289> uh<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.830> probably<00:00:29.160> I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
ease and cubed II was uh I probably I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
ease and cubed II was uh I probably I
like<00:00:30.000> um<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.890> liked<00:00:31.890> range<00:00:32.930> but<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.350> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
like um I liked range but I think I like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.190 
like um I liked range but I think I like
melee<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> melee<00:00:36.300> guy<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
melee more I'm more of a melee guy the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
melee more I'm more of a melee guy the
kill<00:00:37.380> seemed<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.340> faster

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
kill seemed to go a little bit faster

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
kill seemed to go a little bit faster
because<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.420> those<00:00:39.600> bane<00:00:39.840> bolts

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
because I don't have those bane bolts

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
because I don't have those bane bolts
and<00:00:40.410> things<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.969> did<00:00:41.969> buy<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.210> ascension

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and things I did buy some ascension

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
and things I did buy some ascension
crossbows<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.680> speed<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> process<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
crossbows to speed up the process and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
crossbows to speed up the process and
things<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.289> melee<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
things but I think I like melee more so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
things but I think I like melee more so
I'll<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.879> eating<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> lot<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.809> but

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'll be eating a lot more but but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
I'll be eating a lot more but but
whatever<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.329> um<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:53.300> was

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
whatever that's it all right so um I was

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
whatever that's it all right so um I was
killing<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> monsters<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> I've<00:00:55.559> noticed<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
killing the monsters and I've noticed I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
killing the monsters and I've noticed I
was<00:00:56.250> getting<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.760> maybe<00:00:57.030> 10<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.510> hour

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
was getting about maybe 10 an hour

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
was getting about maybe 10 an hour
because<00:00:58.070> whatever<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.399> start<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> monster

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
because whatever you start a monster

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.670 
because whatever you start a monster
you're<00:01:00.539> always<00:01:00.690> kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> knew<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you're always kind of knew about it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
you're always kind of knew about it
until<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.820> good<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
until you get really good at it and you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
until you get really good at it and you
figure<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.710> things<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.610> need<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
figure out how things go how you need to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
figure out how things go how you need to
do<00:01:06.240> things<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> kill<00:01:07.140> things

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
do things how you need to kill things

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
do things how you need to kill things
and<00:01:07.650> grant<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> overloads<00:01:09.270> yet
