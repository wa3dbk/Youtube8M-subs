00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
everyone I'm late from the RC sailors

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.700 
everyone I'm late from the RC sailors
and<00:00:02.090> do<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> quick<00:00:03.389> review<00:00:03.600> out<00:00:03.959> here<00:00:04.230> at<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
and do a quick review out here at the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.839 
and do a quick review out here at the
cave<00:00:04.940> of<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.150> Air<00:00:06.540> Hogs<00:00:06.720> hyper<00:00:07.170> Trax<00:00:07.529> RC<00:00:08.250> tank

truck<00:00:09.360> vehicle<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.410> things<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.769> like<00:00:10.980> about

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
truck vehicle the things I like about

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400 
truck vehicle the things I like about
this<00:00:11.460> vehicle<00:00:11.719> and<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.809> fact<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
this vehicle and the fact that it's a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.200 
this vehicle and the fact that it's a
complete<00:00:13.710> package<00:00:13.889> when<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> buy<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.549> it's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
complete package when you buy it it's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.349 
complete package when you buy it it's
got<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.929> charger<00:00:16.619> cord<00:00:16.949> built<00:00:17.910> into<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
got the charger cord built into the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
got the charger cord built into the
transmitter<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.140> pulls<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.250> which<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.699> really

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
transmitter it pulls out which is really

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929 
transmitter it pulls out which is really
nice<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.320> winds<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.730> plugs

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
nice and it winds back in it plugs

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880 
nice and it winds back in it plugs
directly<00:00:24.150> into<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.750> bottom<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> vehicle

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
directly into the bottom of the vehicle

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650 
directly into the bottom of the vehicle
and<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:27.119> charges

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and it charges

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929 
and it charges
fairly<00:00:28.260> quickly<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.010> pretty<00:00:29.310> good<00:00:29.490> runtime

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
fairly quickly for a pretty good runtime

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.400 
fairly quickly for a pretty good runtime
of<00:00:29.970> maybe<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.630> 10<00:00:30.840> minutes

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of maybe about 10 minutes

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.680 
of maybe about 10 minutes
the<00:00:32.189> transmitter<00:00:32.640> itself<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.450> nice

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the transmitter itself is pretty nice

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.479 
the transmitter itself is pretty nice
because<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> triggered<00:00:34.800> transmitter

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
because it's a triggered transmitter

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.200 
because it's a triggered transmitter
setup<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.600> steering<00:00:37.410> wheel<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.550> softer

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
setup the steering wheel has a softer

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
setup the steering wheel has a softer
rubber<00:00:39.480> grip<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.800> easy<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> hold<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
rubber grip so it's easy to hold on to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.750 
rubber grip so it's easy to hold on to
and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:42.780> has<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> trim<00:00:43.530> function<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and it even has a trim function on the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
and it even has a trim function on the
transmitter<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.450> case<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
transmitter in case it's going to the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
transmitter in case it's going to the
left<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.739> too<00:00:47.070> much<00:00:47.100> by<00:00:47.489> default

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
left or the right too much by default

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.389 
left or the right too much by default
the<00:00:48.480> vehicle<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the vehicle what I like about it is the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
the vehicle what I like about it is the
fact<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.059> flicked<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.570> either<00:00:52.020> side

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
fact that it can flicked on either side

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100 
fact that it can flicked on either side
and<00:00:52.800> continue<00:00:53.520> driving<00:00:54.120> forward<00:00:54.570> though

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and continue driving forward though

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.880 
and continue driving forward though
sometimes<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.250> sensor<00:00:56.850> does<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.570> work<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
sometimes that sensor does not work so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
sometimes that sensor does not work so
if<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.280> driving<00:00:59.579> upside<00:00:59.879> down<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.600> times<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
if it's driving upside down at times you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
if it's driving upside down at times you
have<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> give<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> reverse<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> go

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
have to give it reverse for it to go

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
have to give it reverse for it to go
forward<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.290> lands<00:01:04.920> upside<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.400> pretty

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
forward if it lands upside down pretty

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
forward if it lands upside down pretty
hard<00:01:06.030> though<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.200> pick<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
hard though it will pick that up and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
hard though it will pick that up and
keep<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.729> forward<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> fun

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
keep going forward that's a lot of fun

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.880 
keep going forward that's a lot of fun
when<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> works

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
when it works

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
when it works
the<00:01:11.549> steering<00:01:11.970> seems<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.840> bit

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the steering seems to be a little bit

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.149 
the steering seems to be a little bit
too<00:01:13.320> sensitive

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
too sensitive

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.390 
too sensitive
I<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.409> do<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> fact

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I don't like that I do not like the fact

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
I don't like that I do not like the fact
that<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.880> requires<00:01:18.509> eight<00:01:18.960> double-a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that it requires eight double-a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
that it requires eight double-a
batteries<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> run<00:01:20.549> into<00:01:20.790> transmitter<00:01:21.299> that's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
batteries to run into transmitter that's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.700 
batteries to run into transmitter that's
expensive<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.270> just<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:25.080> things<00:01:25.439> now

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
expensive and just it's most things now

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
expensive and just it's most things now
are<00:01:25.979> running<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> four<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.030> somewhat<00:01:27.630> six

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
are running on four and somewhat six

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
are running on four and somewhat six
eight<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> lot<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.430> unpleasantly

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
eight is a lot I was unpleasantly

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.200 
eight is a lot I was unpleasantly
surprised<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> noticed<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.210> needed

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
surprised when I noticed it had needed

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.030 
surprised when I noticed it had needed
eight<00:01:33.450> double<00:01:33.780> A<00:01:33.869> batteries<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.500> does<00:01:34.890> not

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
eight double A batteries it does not

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.130 
eight double A batteries it does not
come<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:36.090> try<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.100> range<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
come with to try I do like the range of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
come with to try I do like the range of
motion<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> both<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> tracks<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
motion on both of the tracks that's a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
motion on both of the tracks that's a
really<00:01:42.360> nice<00:01:42.509> feature<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.960> noticed<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.500> was

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
really nice feature I noticed when I was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.920 
really nice feature I noticed when I was
driving<00:01:43.979> around<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> rocks<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
driving around going over the rocks that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.639 
driving around going over the rocks that
it<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.170> flex<00:01:46.439> almost<00:01:47.430> full<00:01:48.240> distance<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it would flex almost full distance so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.039 
it would flex almost full distance so
overall<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.850> liked<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.299> product<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
overall I really liked this product I
