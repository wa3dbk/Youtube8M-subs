on<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> small<00:01:02.699> bushing<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> end<00:01:03.600> once

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
on to a small bushing at the end once

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.530 
on to a small bushing at the end once
you<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> pull<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.479> the

you have it pull up here it is with the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.179 
you have it pull up here it is with the
back<00:01:06.750> open<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.860> at

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
back open so you can get a good look at

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
back open so you can get a good look at
what<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.430> aiming<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.840> pulling<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what you're aiming for pulling up on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
what you're aiming for pulling up on
this<00:01:10.380> bushing<00:01:10.619> releases<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> catch<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
this bushing releases the catch for the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
this bushing releases the catch for the
rear<00:01:12.150> door<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.720> camera<00:01:13.049> once<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.830> open

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
rear door of the camera once it's open

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
rear door of the camera once it's open
you'll<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.090> slide<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> shaft<00:01:15.750> back

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you'll now have to slide the shaft back

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
you'll now have to slide the shaft back
in<00:01:16.290> place<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.700> difficult<00:01:17.970> because

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
in place this can be difficult because

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
in place this can be difficult because
there's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> small<00:01:18.869> detent<00:01:19.500> spring<00:01:19.830> block<00:01:20.100> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the path back up you can see it here

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
the path back up you can see it here
located<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> 7<00:01:23.369> o'clock<00:01:23.460> position<00:01:24.119> what's
