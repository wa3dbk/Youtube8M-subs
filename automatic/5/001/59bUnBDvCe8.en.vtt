00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.400
 I greet your friend Luis and good in this 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.730
 video let's root the zp device 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.070
 980 the shop or in the turbo version with a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 processor mtk 65 89 and well I hope that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.000
 also serve for other devices 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 that have that same emt processor 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.830
 cases 65 89 t 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.510
 turbo plus ok then first of all 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.980
 let's verify that the phone 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.860
 do not have root access we go with auto 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.059
 Czech and we go there where it says verified 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.460
 and as we see it says that the device 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.860
 then do not have the permits of 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.720
 superuser ok now what are we going to 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.449
 do is go to adjustments we're going to 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.100
 device system settings and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.680
 here we are going to go to this the option of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.840
 developer options and we mark 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.390
 the option that says debug usb the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.309
 we mark we accept and once 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 done this then we go to the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.260
 computer ok we need new 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.129
 drivers of installed devices 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.200
 on the pc ok to be able to do this 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.200
 root ok then let's connect the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 device 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.540
 the step is now so the steps are 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.690
 very simple very simple and as we see 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 we have already connected the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.540
 device to the computer is no longer 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.060
 appeared mounted on the top and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.720
 here then automatically the computer 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.720
 it is already 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.159
 it already detects the device with what I say 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.289
 they have to have the drivers installed 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.550
 Now what we are going to do is execute 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.250
 this program called root 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.140
 we give in executing this program to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.990
 can find from the blogspot ok 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.370
 to download it and will open this 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.170
 now he is going to open his window 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.930
 of the truth 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.220
 of the program and here will start looking 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.619
 the device there as well could 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.290
 found the device zp no 80 is that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.349
 it was the device that I have only 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.930
 it serves for Chinese devices then 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.510
 yes serve for other devices that do not 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.550
 be the Chinese then to say it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.790
 some way ok then here we go to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.909
 give us tell me root 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 we wait for the device to have 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.069
 mark the four options ok 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.330
 as I tell you this is very very easy very 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.720
 simple and because the root is pretty 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.450
 pretty fast ok then we wait for 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.580
 to finish rooting the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.190
 device with tell them only 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.569
 It is for processors mtk 65 89 p 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.760
 okay 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.579
 Well, as we can see, it's already finished 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.270
 now what we're going we're going to turn the 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.520
 device 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.100
 let's go to this we can disconnect 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.330
 Now we can use the USB cable 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.620
 disconnect 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.530
 and here as we close this that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.230
 so then we are going to adjust well 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.030
 to the menu 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.569
 and we are going to look for the application of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.440
 superuser then as we see here already 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.440
 is in superuser 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.500
 and we are going to verify that we already have this 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.060
 the router ok after webber already asks us for the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.040
 superuser's permissions we're going to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.660
 allow and as we see then the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.240
 device is already rooted 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 completely to ok then how do you 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.920
 I hope I have served this video 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.959
 as I say this one only serves to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.910
 I think it only works for cell phones 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.900
 Chinese and with mtk 65 processors 89 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.900
 t 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.459
 ok this because here we will leave this 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.849
