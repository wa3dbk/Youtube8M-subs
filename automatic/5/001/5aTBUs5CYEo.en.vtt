purchase and I haven't done one in a
long<00:01:18.540> time<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> thought<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.400> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
long time so I thought I would do one so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
long time so I thought I would do one so
this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.689> purse<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.500> got<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> from

this is my purse I actually got it from
target<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> think<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.979> not<00:01:25.979> very

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
target I think it was like not very

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.560 
target I think it was like not very
expensive<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.180> only<00:01:27.330> about

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
expensive i think it was only about

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.490 
expensive i think it was only about
twelve<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.850> fifteen<00:01:29.850> dollars<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
twelve or fifteen dollars when I got it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
twelve or fifteen dollars when I got it
