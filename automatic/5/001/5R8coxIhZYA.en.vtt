00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
settings first and I'm going to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.820 
settings first and I'm going to
get<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.930> Bluetooth<00:01:56.490> cleared<00:01:57.490> out<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:59.650> right

now the Bluetooth will automatically
turned<00:02:01.450> off<00:02:01.600> because<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.230> have<00:02:02.440> only<00:02:02.710> 10%

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430

battery<00:02:03.820> life<00:02:04.800> on<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:05.950> phones<00:02:06.360> left<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.050> I'm

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
battery life on this phones left so I'm

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.950 
battery life on this phones left so I'm
going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.890> unpair<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.420> we<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.690> start

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
going to unpair it so that we can start

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.110 
going to unpair it so that we can start
off<00:02:11.080> fresh<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> trick<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:14.670> make<00:02:15.670> sure<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.170 
off fresh so the trick is make sure you
delete<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.080> don't<00:02:17.260> let<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.180> phonebook

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
which is really irritating because it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.430 
which is really irritating because it
takes<00:02:30.730> minutes<00:02:31.270> if<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> few<00:02:32.170> hundred

don't let the Bluetooth phone book Auto
download<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.370> ok<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.130> most

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
download so ok so it's not the most

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610
