00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.900
 The rain, trying to clear all the days of love 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 Only I was foolish, melting in my dream 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 Hope for love not rushed 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.400
 Good rain, try to erase this moment of silence 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.800
 Love me in the middle of the cold night 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 Heaven alone 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.400
 Leave your love in the clouds 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.400
 Find out about that love day 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.900
 Also in this rainy afternoon 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.900
 I met, cold shoulder 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.000
 But the heart still laughs 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.200
 It's still the afternoon 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.000
 Who do you nest in your arms? 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
 He just kept silent, 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 Lashes, trembling for the heart to burst into tears 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 Gone are, through the moment they are 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 Saying .... hesitant love, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 Then gently put on the lips of the kiss 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.700
 Let me forget cold ... 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.900
 Broken, he was speechless 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 Falling rain shattered the figure 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Let me turn now 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.600
 Let go of my hand in the afternoon ... cold 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.400
 Gone are, through the moment they are 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 Speak love hesitantly, 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.200
 Then gently put on kiss lips .... 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:04.300
 Let me forget cold ... 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.700
 Let me turn now ... 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.300
 Let go of my hand in the afternoon ... cold
