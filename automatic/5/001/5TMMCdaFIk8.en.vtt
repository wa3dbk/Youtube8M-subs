we're<00:00:26.760> moving<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> pee<00:00:27.269> busy<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> we've

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
we're moving on to pee busy and we've

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
we're moving on to pee busy and we've
got<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> map<00:00:29.010> Katrina<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
got the map Katrina which is a bit of a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
got the map Katrina which is a bit of a
problem<00:00:30.689> map<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.650> some<00:00:31.800> people<00:00:32.099> especially

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
problem map for some people especially

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
problem map for some people especially
in<00:00:32.700> Protoss<00:00:33.090> vs<00:00:33.390> terran<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.290> think

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
in Protoss vs terran but I don't think

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
in Protoss vs terran but I don't think
it's<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.649> bad<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.040> Protoss<00:00:35.370> vs<00:00:35.730> zerg<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.030> mean

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it's so bad in Protoss vs zerg I mean

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's so bad in Protoss vs zerg I mean
most<00:00:36.300> people<00:00:36.450> pick<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> Protoss<00:00:37.410> map<00:00:37.710> but

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
most people pick it as a Protoss map but

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.450 
most people pick it as a Protoss map but
in<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> particular<00:00:39.210> matchup<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:41.070> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
in this particular matchup I think it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760 
in this particular matchup I think it's
I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.239> more<00:00:42.450> event<00:00:43.170> I'm

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I think it's a little bit more event I'm

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.020 
I think it's a little bit more event I'm
actually<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.190> looking<00:00:44.340> forward<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
actually really looking forward to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
actually really looking forward to
seeing<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.690> players<00:00:46.050> come<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.320> with

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
seeing what these players come up with

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900 
seeing what these players come up with
just<00:00:46.739> given<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> fact<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.640> quite<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
just given the fact that that's quite a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.020 
just given the fact that that's quite a
quite<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> large<00:00:49.110> map<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.489> seeing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
quite a large map and we might be seeing

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
quite a large map and we might be seeing
a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> micromanagement<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a little bit of micromanagement in the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
a little bit of micromanagement in the
mid<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> late<00:00:53.610> game<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.960> always<00:00:55.289> quite

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
mid to late game and that's always quite

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.200 
mid to late game and that's always quite
exciting<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.100> both<00:00:56.520> players<00:00:56.640> expanding

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
exciting if both players expanding

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.369 
exciting if both players expanding
everywhere<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> where<00:00:57.870> there's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
everywhere and where there's a lot of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
everywhere and where there's a lot of
different<00:00:58.710> things<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.489> always

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
different things going on it's always

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.740 
different things going on it's always
quite<00:00:59.789> fun<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> comment<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> kind

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
quite fun to comment here and that kind

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
quite fun to comment here and that kind
of<00:01:00.780> stuff<00:01:01.520> yeah<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> definitely<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
of stuff yeah I definitely think the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
of stuff yeah I definitely think the
bees<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> build<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:03.989> strong<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.710> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
bees to build can be very strong in this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
bees to build can be very strong in this
mad<00:01:04.979> simply<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.489> you've<00:01:05.610> already<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
mad simply because you've already got a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
mad simply because you've already got a
free<00:01:06.479> base<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.869> front<00:01:07.140> door<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
free base in front door you got that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.649 
free base in front door you got that
base<00:01:08.640> basically<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.240> secondary<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
base basically in your secondary that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.670 
base basically in your secondary that
you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.810> take<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:09.990> usually<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> issue

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you can take and usually what the issue

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
you can take and usually what the issue
comes<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> post<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.970> cancered

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
comes down to post that is cancered

comes down to post that is cancered

contain the Protoss or cancer can get a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
contain the Protoss or cancer can get a
third<00:01:15.240> base<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:15.990> difficult<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.409> zar

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
third base it's very difficult for zar

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
third base it's very difficult for zar
to<00:01:17.189> hold<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> third<00:01:17.880> base<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> field

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to hold a third base out in the field

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840 
to hold a third base out in the field
especially<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.380> Dark<00:01:20.159> Templar<00:01:20.340> drop

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
especially if you go Dark Templar drop

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
especially if you go Dark Templar drop
things<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.390> looks<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.780> smoky<00:01:22.110> has

things like that looks like smoky has

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
things like that looks like smoky has
scouted<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> base<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> 12th<00:01:23.490> clock

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

going down there i think is you might
actually<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.260> ignore<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.620> hatchery<00:02:47.980> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
actually just ignore that hatchery and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.560 
actually just ignore that hatchery and
go<00:02:48.160> straight<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.730> get<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.850> thematic<00:02:49.060> drone

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
go straight in and get a thematic drone

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.700 
go straight in and get a thematic drone
kills<00:02:49.780> look<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.020> those<00:02:50.140> drones<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:50.560> just

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
kills look at those drones there just

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.250 
kills look at those drones there just
look<00:02:50.980> there<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:51.640> pondering<00:02:52.630> away<00:02:52.990> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
look there just pondering away and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.900 
look there just pondering away and
they're<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.770> immense<00:02:54.340> me<00:02:54.490> once<00:02:54.700> that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
they're going to be immense me once that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.300 
they're going to be immense me once that
a<00:02:55.090> zealot<00:02:55.330> arrives<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.810> no<00:02:56.740> look<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
a zealot arrives and no look the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.760 
a zealot arrives and no look the
spawning<00:02:57.550> pool<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.000> only<00:02:58.390> just<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:59.080> we're<00:02:59.620> only

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
spawning pool is only just up we're only

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770 
spawning pool is only just up we're only
now<00:03:00.010> going<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.310> see<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.460> few<00:03:00.880> zouk<00:03:01.420> that's<00:03:01.630> being

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
now going to see a few zouk that's being

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.870 
now going to see a few zouk that's being
created<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.260> reinforced<00:03:02.890> Mozilla's<00:03:03.580> rocking

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
created and reinforced Mozilla's rocking

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.700 
created and reinforced Mozilla's rocking
place<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:05.050> game<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.440> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> be

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
place so this this game is going to be

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.340 
place so this this game is going to be
short-lived<00:03:06.310> indeed<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:07.060> look<00:03:07.900> at<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.080> probe

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
short-lived indeed a look at the probe

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.050 
short-lived indeed a look at the probe
over<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.740> top<00:03:08.890> left<00:03:09.070> looking<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.640> saw<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
over the top left looking I saw the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.330 
over the top left looking I saw the
drone<00:03:10.540> planning<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:11.650> an<00:03:11.740> expansion<00:03:12.040> there

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
drone planning on for an expansion there

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.310 
drone planning on for an expansion there
yeah<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.030> looks<00:03:13.240> like<00:03:13.420> Jesus<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:13.960> planning<00:03:14.260> on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
yeah it looks like Jesus was planning on

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.930 
yeah it looks like Jesus was planning on
an<00:03:14.440> all-out<00:03:14.590> macro<00:03:15.160> management<00:03:15.550> game<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
an all-out macro management game and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.100 
an all-out macro management game and
it's<00:03:16.060> been<00:03:16.210> caught<00:03:16.450> with<00:03:16.630> his<00:03:16.750> pants<00:03:16.989> down

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
it's been caught with his pants down

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.280 
it's been caught with his pants down
totally<00:03:17.980> off<00:03:18.100> guard<00:03:18.130> here<00:03:18.580> by<00:03:18.760> smoking<00:03:19.690> very

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
totally off guard here by smoking very

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.650 
totally off guard here by smoking very
unfortunate<00:03:20.830> stuff<00:03:21.040> yeah<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.270> certain<00:03:22.540> things

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
unfortunate stuff yeah so certain things

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.940 
unfortunate stuff yeah so certain things
are<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.050> produced<00:03:23.350> don't<00:03:23.530> say<00:03:23.709> don't

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
are going to be produced don't say don't

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.199 
are going to be produced don't say don't
think<00:03:24.160> it's<00:03:24.250> gonna<00:03:24.340> be<00:03:24.430> enough<00:03:24.489> nice<00:03:24.850> screen

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
think it's gonna be enough nice screen

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.520 
think it's gonna be enough nice screen
there<00:03:25.360> at<00:03:25.570> least<00:03:25.959> he's<00:03:26.110> surrounding<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
there at least he's surrounding that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.949 
there at least he's surrounding that
single<00:03:27.520> cell<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.760> looks<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.090> as<00:03:28.239> that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
single cell it looks like as that

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.120 
single cell it looks like as that
something<00:03:29.140> colonies<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.680> up<00:03:29.770> but<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.950> still

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
something colonies going up but I still

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.290 
something colonies going up but I still
don't<00:03:30.250> think<00:03:30.370> he<00:03:30.580> has<00:03:30.670> enough<00:03:30.700> really<00:03:31.120> out<00:03:31.239> in

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
don't think he has enough really out in

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.550 
don't think he has enough really out in
the<00:03:31.360> field<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.690> defend<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.050> third<00:03:32.230> hatchery

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the field to defend that third hatchery

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.260 
the field to defend that third hatchery
that's<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.220> out<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.489> mortal<00:03:33.880> certainly

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
that's just out and mortal certainly

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.420 
that's just out and mortal certainly
pushing<00:03:34.480> at<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> very<00:03:34.989> least<00:03:35.280> Smokies<00:03:36.280> going

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
scout to Jesus initially that's where he

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.420 
scout to Jesus initially that's where he
sent<00:04:50.110> his<00:04:50.229> bro<00:04:50.469> just<00:04:50.770> straight<00:04:51.039> away<00:04:51.219> to<00:04:51.249> the

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
sent his bro just straight away to the

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.700 
sent his bro just straight away to the
twelve<00:04:51.639> o'clock<00:04:51.789> position<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.389> had<00:04:52.960> Jesus

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
twelve o'clock position and had Jesus

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.719 
twelve o'clock position and had Jesus
actually<00:04:53.979> spawned<00:04:54.219> the<00:04:54.370> six<00:04:54.580> o'clock

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
actually spawned the six o'clock

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.059 
actually spawned the six o'clock
position<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.990> prob<00:04:56.229> would<00:04:56.409> have<00:04:56.500> taken<00:04:56.680> so

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
position that prob would have taken so

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.559 
position that prob would have taken so
long<00:04:57.250> because<00:04:57.460> Katrina<00:04:57.789> again<00:04:58.210> makes<00:04:58.389> such<00:04:58.539> a

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
long because Katrina again makes such a

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.119 
long because Katrina again makes such a
big<00:04:58.689> map<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.050> pro<00:04:59.199> would<00:04:59.379> have<00:04:59.469> taken<00:04:59.680> so<00:04:59.949> long

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 
big map the pro would have taken so long

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.589 
big map the pro would have taken so long
to<00:05:00.250> get<00:05:00.400> eventually<00:05:00.909> around<00:05:01.120> there<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.419> find

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
to get eventually around there and find

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.149 
to get eventually around there and find
out<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.139> Jesus<00:05:02.319> was<00:05:02.650> not<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:03.039> with

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
out that the Jesus was not going with

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.909 
out that the Jesus was not going with
the<00:05:03.219> nine<00:05:03.370> ball<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:04.539> think<00:05:04.840> Jesus<00:05:05.529> probably

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
the nine ball and I think Jesus probably

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.260 
the nine ball and I think Jesus probably
would<00:05:06.009> have<00:05:06.069> taken<00:05:06.219> that<00:05:06.370> comfortably<00:05:06.789> so<00:05:07.060> I

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
would have taken that comfortably so I

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.089 
would have taken that comfortably so I
don't<00:05:07.810> really<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.199> say<00:05:08.379> this<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.770> mean<00:05:08.889> I

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
don't really like to say this I mean I

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.529 
don't really like to say this I mean I
hate<00:05:09.460> saying<00:05:09.639> this<00:05:09.729> about<00:05:09.879> starcraft<00:05:10.240> games

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
hate saying this about starcraft games

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.149 
hate saying this about starcraft games
but<00:05:10.779> I<00:05:10.930> think<00:05:11.319> there<00:05:11.469> was<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.620> factor<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:11.979> luck

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
but I think there was a factor of luck

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.890 
but I think there was a factor of luck
involved<00:05:12.340> with<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:13.029> that<00:05:13.479> was<00:05:13.599> possibly

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
involved with that and that was possibly

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.420 
involved with that and that was possibly
the<00:05:13.960> reason<00:05:14.229> why<00:05:14.319> the<00:05:14.379> game<00:05:14.560> was<00:05:14.740> as<00:05:14.919> one-sided

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
the reason why the game was as one-sided

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.659 
the reason why the game was as one-sided
as<00:05:15.669> it<00:05:15.789> was<00:05:16.620> yeah<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.979> seemed<00:05:18.129> like<00:05:18.250> Jesus<00:05:18.520> had

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
as it was yeah it seemed like Jesus had

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.309 
as it was yeah it seemed like Jesus had
a<00:05:18.699> plan<00:05:18.969> going<00:05:19.240> into<00:05:19.479> this<00:05:19.659> and<00:05:19.900> then<00:05:20.020> when<00:05:20.229> it

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
a plan going into this and then when it

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.550 
a plan going into this and then when it
just<00:05:20.529> didn't<00:05:20.770> pan<00:05:20.919> out<00:05:20.979> he<00:05:21.879> just<00:05:22.599> was<00:05:22.990> too

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
just didn't pan out he just was too

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.110 
just didn't pan out he just was too
flustered<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.159> couldn't<00:05:24.520> really<00:05:24.669> adjust

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
flustered and couldn't really adjust

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.929 
flustered and couldn't really adjust
when<00:05:25.629> he<00:05:25.659> doing<00:05:26.199> his<00:05:26.500> 12th<00:05:26.919> hat<00:05:27.279> when<00:05:27.610> his<00:05:27.759> 12

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
when he doing his 12th hat when his 12

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.550 
when he doing his 12th hat when his 12
Hatcher<00:05:28.120> has<00:05:28.270> already<00:05:28.360> spotted<00:05:28.659> it<00:05:29.349> looked

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
just felt you could take the game with

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.649 
just felt you could take the game with
that<00:05:34.509> delegate<00:05:35.439> and<00:05:35.639> yeah<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:37.000> was<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.360> really

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
that delegate and yeah I was a really

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:38.969 
that delegate and yeah I was a really
fast<00:05:37.839> game<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.229> was<00:05:38.289> actually<00:05:38.469> i<00:05:38.620> think<00:05:38.649> the

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
fast game that was actually i think the

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.249 
fast game that was actually i think the
no<00:05:39.610> offense<00:05:39.879> to<00:05:40.060> Jesus<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.750> smoky<00:05:41.110> but<00:05:41.199> I

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
no offense to Jesus and smoky but I

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.809 
no offense to Jesus and smoky but I
think<00:05:41.469> that<00:05:41.500> was<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.740> most<00:05:42.039> and<00:05:42.250> spectacular

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
think that was the most and spectacular

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.010 
think that was the most and spectacular
game<00:05:42.909> I've<00:05:43.089> ever<00:05:43.120> seen<00:05:43.419> in<00:05:43.569> Yankee<00:05:43.839> League
