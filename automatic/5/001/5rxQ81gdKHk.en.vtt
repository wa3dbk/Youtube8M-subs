this is good warning this is gonna be

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
this is good warning this is gonna be
very<00:00:27.930> difficult<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> explain<00:00:29.400> during

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
very difficult for me to explain during

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.500 
very difficult for me to explain during
the<00:00:30.449> video<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:33.829> that's<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:36.090> problematic

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the video so that's can be problematic

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.440 
the video so that's can be problematic
from<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:38.040> know<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.149> hang<00:00:39.329> out

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
put this on macro you have two ends like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.990 
put this on macro you have two ends like
so<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:02.719> that's<00:01:03.719> weight<00:01:04.580> starts<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
so and that's weight starts and where it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
so and that's weight starts and where it
ends<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.500> uh<00:01:11.030> okay<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.960> cut<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> piece<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
ends and uh okay then you cut a piece of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
ends and uh okay then you cut a piece of
hemp<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.920> regular<00:01:17.340> hemp<00:01:17.549> probably<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
hemp I'm just regular hemp probably I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.830 
hemp I'm just regular hemp probably I
made<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:20.009> long<00:01:20.250> an<00:01:20.520> accident<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.630> don't

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
made a really long an accident so don't

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
made a really long an accident so don't
do<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:24.619> basically<00:01:25.619> oh<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.210> fold

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
do that basically oh all you do you fold

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.190 
do that basically oh all you do you fold
it<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.630> half<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.759> makes<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.210> loop<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:33.200> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it in half so it makes a loop and you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
it in half so it makes a loop and you
have<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.829> two<00:01:35.040> strings<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> you'll<00:01:35.759> put

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
have these two strings and you'll put

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.980 
have these two strings and you'll put
them<00:01:36.180> next<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> each<00:01:36.540> other

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.760 

so<00:01:40.990> they<00:01:41.229> look<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.450> know<00:01:43.539> you<00:01:44.499> hold

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
so they look like this you know you hold

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.059 
so they look like this you know you hold
them<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.609> you<00:01:46.450> take<00:01:46.719> your<00:01:46.990> folded<00:01:47.469> string<00:01:47.859> and

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
them and you take your folded string and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.819 
them and you take your folded string and
you<00:01:48.549> just<00:01:48.789> basically<00:01:49.000> put<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.929> loop<00:01:50.109> on<00:01:50.289> top

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
you just basically put the loop on top

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:57.630 
you just basically put the loop on top
of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.920> two<00:01:54.100> strings<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.429> hold

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
of the two strings like that so you hold

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.059 
of the two strings like that so you hold
it<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.600> take<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.990> string<00:02:01.319> take<00:02:02.319> a<00:02:02.560> string

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
it and you take a string take a string

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.029 
it and you take a string take a string
and<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.640> start<00:02:03.969> wrapping<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.780> oh<00:02:05.049> not<00:02:05.890> that

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
and you start wrapping it oh not that

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.460 
and you start wrapping it oh not that
one<00:02:06.569> you<00:02:07.569> take<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> one<00:02:07.959> that's<00:02:08.140> crossing

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
one you take the one that's crossing

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.270 
one you take the one that's crossing
over<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.910> I'm<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.049> take<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.239> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
over so I'm going to take this one and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.640 
over so I'm going to take this one and
I'm<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.459> wrap<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.849> around

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.509 

one<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:25.290> usually<00:02:26.290> do<00:02:26.409> like<00:02:26.439> four<00:02:27.010> times<00:02:29.370> 23<00:02:30.370> and

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
one I usually do like four times 23 and

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.410 
one I usually do like four times 23 and
he<00:02:30.579> just<00:02:30.939> really<00:02:31.420> tight<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:37.180> then<00:02:37.329> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
he just really tight for and then you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.170 
he just really tight for and then you
hold<00:02:37.659> that<00:02:37.810> there<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.040> it'll<00:02:39.220> look<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.810> that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
hold that there so it'll look like that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.179 
hold that there so it'll look like that
you<00:02:43.180> hold<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.540> there<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.170> then<00:02:44.950> with<00:02:45.099> the

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
you hold that there and then with the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.289 
you hold that there and then with the
string<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.609> you<00:02:45.730> were<00:02:45.819> wrapping<00:02:46.180> around

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
string that you were wrapping around

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.679 
string that you were wrapping around
with<00:02:46.629> so<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.349> one<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:49.329> put<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
with so it's this one you put it

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.259 
with so it's this one you put it
underneath<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.159> loop<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:54.609> hold<00:02:54.909> that<00:02:54.970> there

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
underneath the loop you hold that there

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.690 
underneath the loop you hold that there
and<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> other<00:02:56.349> string<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.310> side<00:02:57.549> this

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and the other string on the side this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.460 
and the other string on the side this
part<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.030> confusing<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.650> pull<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
part is confusing you just pull it so

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.690 
part is confusing you just pull it so
when<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> pull<00:03:02.889> this<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.400> what<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:03.639> going

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
when I pull this this is what it's going

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.420 
when I pull this this is what it's going
to<00:03:03.819> do<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.599> loop<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:07.480> gonna<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.340> do

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
to do to the loop just gonna so I do

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.000 
to do to the loop just gonna so I do
that<00:03:09.639> wrong

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.300

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.670 
nope wait oh god this is not a very good
tutorial<00:03:24.129> but<00:03:25.129> it'll<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:27.140> basically<00:03:27.439> it'll

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
tutorial but it'll do so basically it'll

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.539 
tutorial but it'll do so basically it'll
tighten<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:30.129> all<00:03:31.129> you<00:03:31.370> do

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
tighten it like that and then all you do

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:41.830 
tighten it like that and then all you do
from<00:03:31.730> there<00:03:31.879> you<00:03:32.420> tie<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.950> I'm<00:03:33.950> not<00:03:40.629> like<00:03:41.629> that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
from there you tie it I'm not like that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.000 
from there you tie it I'm not like that
why<00:03:42.470> isn't<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:42.950> clear<00:03:44.379> tie<00:03:45.379> knot<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.950> then

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
why isn't that clear tie knot and then

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.030 
why isn't that clear tie knot and then
on<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.310> other<00:03:46.340> end<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.879> tie<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.150> knot<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.920> is

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
on the other end you tie a knot this is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.190 
on the other end you tie a knot this is
just<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.549> make<00:03:49.760> sure<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.599> doesn't<00:03:50.810> move

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
just to make sure that it doesn't move

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.410 
just to make sure that it doesn't move
that<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:53.209> doesn't<00:03:53.540> oh<00:03:53.810> sorry<00:03:54.560> oh<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:56.209> burp
