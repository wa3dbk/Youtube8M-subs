good<00:00:24.430> morning<00:00:24.820> welcome<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.750> Bell

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
good morning welcome to Bell

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.650 
good morning welcome to Bell
Laboratories<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.970> is<00:00:28.090> one<00:00:28.270> of<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:28.420> places

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
Laboratories this is one of the places

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.150 
Laboratories this is one of the places
where<00:00:28.960> we<00:00:29.140> research<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:29.800> develop

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
where we research and develop

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.880 
where we research and develop
communication<00:00:30.640> systems<00:00:31.450> of<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.660> future<00:00:32.020> you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
communication systems of the future you

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.890 
communication systems of the future you
know<00:00:33.010> it<00:00:33.160> all<00:00:33.310> began<00:00:33.670> with<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.030> simple<00:00:34.120> pair<00:00:34.750> of

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
know it all began with a simple pair of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.080 
know it all began with a simple pair of
wires<00:00:35.170> over<00:00:35.980> which<00:00:36.130> two<00:00:36.340> people<00:00:36.370> could<00:00:36.850> talk

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
wires over which two people could talk

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.570 
wires over which two people could talk
to<00:00:37.270> each<00:00:37.420> other<00:00:37.629> but<00:00:38.500> as<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.830> nation<00:00:39.190> grew

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
to each other but as the nation grew

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.610 
to each other but as the nation grew
phone<00:00:40.270> communication<00:00:41.020> how<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.200> grow<00:00:41.410> right

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
phone communication how to grow right

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820 
phone communication how to grow right
along<00:00:41.860> with<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.129> I<00:00:43.020> sure<00:00:44.020> hope<00:00:44.050> these<00:00:44.470> plans

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
along with it I sure hope these plans

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.250 
along with it I sure hope these plans
for<00:00:44.950> my<00:00:45.160> telephone<00:00:45.700> work<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.930> should<00:00:47.230> be

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
for my telephone work it should be

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.299 
for my telephone work it should be
pretty<00:00:47.620> easy<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:49.739> wonder<00:00:50.739> what<00:00:50.890> they're<00:00:51.040> doing

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
pretty easy I wonder what they're doing

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.470 
pretty easy I wonder what they're doing
today

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
today

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.370 
today
think<00:00:52.989> I'll<00:00:53.140> go<00:00:53.320> take<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.590> look<00:00:54.210> let's<00:00:55.210> see<00:00:55.630> i'll

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
think I'll go take a look let's see i'll

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.880 
think I'll go take a look let's see i'll
need<00:00:56.650> string<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:58.140> cups<00:00:59.140> and<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:01.329> else<00:01:01.890> maybe

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
need string and cups and what else maybe

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.890 
need string and cups and what else maybe
this<00:01:03.340> time<00:01:03.640> they'll<00:01:03.910> let<00:01:04.059> me<00:01:04.210> play<00:01:04.239> with<00:01:04.659> them

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900

there<00:01:11.860> they<00:01:12.070> are<00:01:12.100> i<00:01:12.550> bet<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.450> could<00:01:13.630> talk<00:01:13.900> to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
there they are i bet we could talk to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.780 
there they are i bet we could talk to
the<00:01:14.230> astronauts<00:01:14.830> if<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:15.220> could<00:01:15.400> get<00:01:15.520> enough

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
the astronauts if we could get enough

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.520 
the astronauts if we could get enough
strength<00:01:16.180> boy<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.800> could<00:01:17.980> make<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.190> fortune<00:01:18.550> i

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
strength boy we could make a fortune i

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.680

there's<00:03:09.070> gotta<00:03:09.730> be<00:03:09.910> an<00:03:10.120> easier<00:03:10.270> way<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.780> do

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
there's gotta be an easier way to do

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.840 
there's gotta be an easier way to do
this<00:03:11.970> hmm<00:03:12.970> boys<00:03:13.390> are<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.080> clumsy<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.640> now

these scientists are conducting an

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.990 
these scientists are conducting an
experiment<00:04:00.020> using<00:04:00.350> laser<00:04:00.890> light<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.430> transmit

voiceover optical fibers of course we

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.600 
voiceover optical fibers of course we
still<00:04:05.150> have<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.450> solve<00:04:05.630> many<00:04:05.930> problems<00:04:06.610> now

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
still have to solve many problems now

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.930 
still have to solve many problems now
it's<00:04:07.970> my<00:04:08.060> turn<00:04:09.340> what<00:04:10.340> are<00:04:10.460> the<00:04:10.550> best<00:04:10.730> materials

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's my turn what are the best materials

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.530 
it's my turn what are the best materials
to<00:04:11.600> use<00:04:13.270> simple<00:04:15.370> what<00:04:16.370> new<00:04:16.549> equipment<00:04:17.209> will<00:04:17.420> be

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
to use simple what new equipment will be

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.030 
to use simple what new equipment will be
needed<00:04:19.180> Bob<00:04:20.180> should<00:04:20.480> do<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.870> what<00:04:21.530> effect<00:04:21.859> will

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
needed Bob should do it what effect will

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:55.779 
I'm going to adjust the tracking control

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:04.110 
I'm going to adjust the tracking control
plot<00:04:56.319> here<00:05:01.949> all<00:05:02.949> right<00:05:03.159> here<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.400> go<00:05:03.490> all<00:05:03.939> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
plot here all right here we go all the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.450 
plot here all right here we go all the
way<00:05:04.499> that's<00:05:05.499> a<00:05:05.590> little<00:05:05.800> too<00:05:05.889> far<00:05:06.069> cut<00:05:06.249> it<00:05:06.340> back

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
way that's a little too far cut it back

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.939 
way that's a little too far cut it back

Terrace devote all right how about the

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.469 
Terrace devote all right how about the
virus<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:13.270> was<00:05:13.599> better<00:05:14.069> how<00:05:15.069> was<00:05:15.249> that

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
virus that was better how was that

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.939 
virus that was better how was that
that's<00:05:16.479> better<00:05:16.719> a<00:05:17.050> little<00:05:17.289> bit<00:05:17.379> more<00:05:19.949> it
