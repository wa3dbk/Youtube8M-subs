00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello today video about 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.559
 November cosmetic favorites and so 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.139
 let's get down the favorite this is the base under 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.630
 makeup from shubur which is called use 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.820
 on da bass mousse without i like this 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 the basis of absolutely everything as it falls 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.890
 how hanna doesn't hold makeup not very 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.660
 unusual texture shaped like a musa at the base 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.160
 you can wear separately that is not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 the use of which tonal means 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 because she has certain ones 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 my favorite foundation is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.880
 of the month was the tonal basis of chanel 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 which is called the look at lumiere aqua 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.410
 I have a very good g20 shade 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 I like the basis of the fact that it is very 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.680
 easy 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 I like her smell but only 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.790
 minus and us a little dry face 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.700
 so in order for it not to me 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.610
 I put on drying so thick enough 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.800
 a layer of moisturizer and basically me 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.940
 everyone likes nothing on her also this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.039
 tone foundation is very good 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.489
 covers all your flaws on the face 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.799
 and personally i don't even need some 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.079
 corrector and concealer and also my 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.420
 Bronzer at has remained the favorite 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.549
 the fifth which is called chocolat 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.170
 salt and you awesome broder thing 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.349
 the main thing is it smells like chocolate 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.499
 he has a very beautiful shade completely 

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.659
 no yellowness and natural 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.939
 tan color month I often enjoyed 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 Here is such here tribes world from shisejdo 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 you all know him like that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.609
 white color probably show 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.959
 swat no I will not 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.929
 what do I like about him that he 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:43.079
 really gives such know 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.779
 natural glow but its not mine 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.819
 very much on the face do not know why 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:49.169
 probably because he has this 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.259
 powdery texture 

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:55.200
 so you need to be careful with him and not 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.869
 overdo my favorite blush in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.440
 crazy but 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.560

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.510

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 just a natural shade to your cheeks 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.260
 cheeks much more naturally than 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.280

 eyes or gray shade camera looks 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.600
 that's how they already know this beige 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:26.500

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:33.610

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.530
 see you know such a shade 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.709
 beige-pink while there are such 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.780
 small blotches 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.519
 don't know silver shimmer as well as 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.360
 this month I used very often 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.860
 urban dickey pencil in a shade of whiskey 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.630
 they are very soft and strongly pigmented 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.770
 so you know dark brown 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.470
 knock on the brown shade without 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.090
 glitter don't know anything basically in it 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.230
 special not so let's get started 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.260
 lips 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.760
 for starters, I'll show you my favorite balm 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.290
 This balm from fresh which is called 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.200
 sugaley rhythm and spf15 he has this 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.140
 here are the iron packs enough 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.510
 such is and 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.900
 to get you need to unleash yourself 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.470
 a white balm that smells like it 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.360
 very very tasty lemon but so 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.850
 like a lip my hour is pretty good 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.919
 condition they do not need some 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.380
 very strong moisture and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.290
 restore then this balm to me 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.080
 came up just one hundred percent but if 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.780
 you have some kind of cracked hum 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.419
 afraid do you know painful and then 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.070
 it is unlikely that he will restore you 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.380
 so if your lip is in good 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.169
 able this balm will like it 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.540
 exactly a and my next favorite was 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.940
 Here is such a balm duck pmax I liked 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.450
 the fact that this means two in one 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.080
 it is a balm and also lipstick because 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.310
 he has a shade as you know 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.780
 coral pink crowns at very 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.910
 good thing because you don't need 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.550
 think to take such a 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.030
 lipstick and balm take this one thing 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.460
 and forward these are all my favorites of November i 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.940
 I hope you were interested in everyone yet 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.940
 to new meetings
