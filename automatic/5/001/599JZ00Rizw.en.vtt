00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.340
 welcome to a new video review 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.450
 let's continue with the second part 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.510
 of the armed wing and cat version as 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.240
 can see who has it armed 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.340
 here is only armed does not have 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.070
 no stickers have not painted 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.470
 nothing comes practically you what 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.660
 they disarm it and they are going to stay like this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.440
 you can see that all the pieces are 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.060
 colored have many details 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.000
 the living room 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.430
 have one 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 accessories 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.560
 has a shield has 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.340
 2 pack with power recharges for the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.140
 rifle 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.140
 comes with a lightsaber 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 and with the rifle 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.090
 to a great reflection 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.629
 general comments a model 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 I entertained the sea very firm and it is not so 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.030
 articulate that is because you have to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.300
 bear all the weight that means 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.190
 have these tremendous wings 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.070
 and a tremendous rifle we're going to 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.970
 show how he behaves with all the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.970
 mounted parts 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.939
 is there 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.790
 let's accommodate the straightest pages 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.560
 the shield has this connector 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.250
 I love 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 yes 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.660
 the hands are articulated with a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660
 Connection 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.120
 where they have all three of the landlines and the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.120
 the articulated index 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.840
 here 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.930
 let's move everything 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.090
 the rifle in the only thing that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.080
 It costs a bit to tell 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.080
 as you can see 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.600
 supports the weight of everything 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.600
 tremendously sign the model 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.150
 have another detail here 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.560
 that they meet there in the head but of 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.030
 all ways can be opened what 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.030
 enough for the gloves 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.370
 the model would be highly recommended by 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.660
 hit them 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.660
 the stickers 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.360
 and the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.939
 this they say try transfer 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.969
 which are stickers that stick to pressure 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.180
 we showed a tutorial of how to paste 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.039
 that 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.039
 and this being that it's tickets only 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.569
 we were talking to the team 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.689
 what else could we do 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.689
 and we are going to try to put the small 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.819
 led light here because the truth 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.409
 the model has very things that is 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.270
 additional resources that could be 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.300
 apart from sticking the stickers for 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.319
 denying it there are colors that are not 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.530
 example the inside of the shield have the 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.040
 art of the box appears and here is not 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.590
 we have to avoid that 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.720
 here in the wing there is a detail that neither 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.570
 comes painted that are very very minimal 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.570
 this person that is in bas-relief 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.279
 and the inside of the skirts 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.110
 yes 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.759
 that comes in white 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.680
 the truth is practically not necessary 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.180
 no other color 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.139
 the plastic super good quality then 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.090
 what are we going to see in the next 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.070
 chapters we're going to dedicate a single 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.949
 chapter to the transformation so that 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.280
 can you see, let's paint these areas 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.130
 that we already mentioned 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.010
 let's do the tutorial to show 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.010
 how to paste these dry transfer 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:02.089
 and if everything turns out well we're going to put 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.089
 a small led here 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.290
 that we have left that we need to show 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.840
 we needed to show another saber comes 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.760
 To be 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.680
 but it only comes to one for 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.230
 complete a handle to complete it 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.290
 and the little turn comes 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.290
 Y 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.260
 and there that would be followed inside of 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:36.500
 the cabin 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.500
 let's show the cabin is now here 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.729
 I will have to go I want help 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.409
 so 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.699
 the most interesting thing we can show 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.550
 now is that we're going to try to put 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.939
 as the LED commented and connect it by 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.939
 here in 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.349
 I hope that turns out well 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.040
 to close I think it's a very good 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.560
 model 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.980
 and it comes practically armed very firm 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.569
 easy to assemble entertaining to assemble for 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.479
 nothing complicated 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:21.559
 super recommended for followers 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.559
 by gand unwin 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.720
 and we'll see each other in the next 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.940
 chapter 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.570
