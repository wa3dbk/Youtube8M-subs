00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the pasta machine just to several times

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.640 
the pasta machine just to several times
to<00:00:08.970> get<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.150> all<00:00:09.389> nice<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.719> conditioned<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
ready to work with and one time through

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.999 
ready to work with and one time through
the<00:00:12.929> pasta<00:00:13.259> machine<00:00:13.349> isn't<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> be

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the pasta machine isn't going to be

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.890 
the pasta machine isn't going to be
thick<00:00:14.250> enough<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> don't<00:00:14.849> need<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
thick enough and you don't need the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.710 
thick enough and you don't need the
pasta<00:00:16.199> machine<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.590> all<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.070> actually

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
pasta machine at all for this actually

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
pasta machine at all for this actually
just<00:00:18.720> take<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:19.020> clay<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.560> condition<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.160> by

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
just take your clay and condition it by

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
just take your clay and condition it by
squishing<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.570> together<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> warming<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.260> up

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
squishing it together and warming it up

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
squishing it together and warming it up
getting<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> ready<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.160> work<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.820> then

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
getting it ready to work with and then

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
getting it ready to work with and then
these<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.609> hard<00:00:26.609> clay<00:00:27.769> these<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.160> old

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
these are hard clay these are really old

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.440 
these are hard clay these are really old
ones<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> could<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> didn't<00:00:31.470> use

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
ones so and you could see I didn't use

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
ones so and you could see I didn't use
and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> use<00:00:34.079> multiple<00:00:34.530> colors<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.219> clay

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and then you use multiple colors of clay

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
and then you use multiple colors of clay
or<00:00:35.399> my<00:00:35.640> scrap<00:00:35.940> clay<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> used<00:00:36.420> my<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.750> clay<00:00:36.989> at

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
or my scrap clay I used my good clay at

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
or my scrap clay I used my good clay at
the<00:00:37.230> time<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.160> new<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> mmm

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the time because I was new to it and mmm

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
the time because I was new to it and mmm
not<00:00:39.899> thinking<00:00:40.230> straight<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.700> have

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
smooth from um you know from mixing it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
smooth from um you know from mixing it
all<00:00:50.520> together<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:51.899> wrinkles

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
all together you don't want big wrinkles

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.740 
all together you don't want big wrinkles
in<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> best<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> do

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
in it and one of the best things to do

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
in it and one of the best things to do
is<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.710> make<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> into<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> ball<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.969> then

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is to make it into a ball and then

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
is to make it into a ball and then
slightly<00:00:57.899> squish<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> and<00:01:00.590> I'm<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.770> use

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
slightly squish it and I'm gonna use

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.479 
slightly squish it and I'm gonna use
rubber<00:01:02.550> stamps<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> effect<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> I'm

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
rubber stamps for this effect and I'm

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
rubber stamps for this effect and I'm
look<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> bottom<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.450> stamp<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.049> I'm

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
look at the bottom on my stamp here I'm
looking<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.150> there

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
looking at this one and I can see there

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.190 
looking at this one and I can see there
are<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.229> leaves<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.990> these<00:01:12.990> would

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
are some leaves in there and these would

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.060 
are some leaves in there and these would
provide<00:01:13.530> excellent<00:01:14.430> texture<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:16.070> clay

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
provide excellent texture for clay

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
provide excellent texture for clay
leaves<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.939> um<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.140> later

gonna<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.369> ahead<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> flatten<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
gonna go ahead and flatten it a little

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
gonna go ahead and flatten it a little
more<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.740> need<00:01:31.890> too

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
much and that bad that'll work so take

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
much and that bad that'll work so take
it<00:01:36.020> squish<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.490> really<00:01:38.490> well<00:01:38.880> rock<00:01:39.450> it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
would this is a metal button so I would

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.850 
would this is a metal button so I would
go<00:04:35.090> ahead<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.300> bake<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.900> in<00:04:36.020> there<00:04:36.260> so<00:04:36.710> that

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
go ahead and bake it in there so that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.740 
go ahead and bake it in there so that
way<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.310> wouldn't<00:04:37.640> lose<00:04:37.880> any<00:04:38.180> detail<00:04:38.600> or

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
way it wouldn't lose any detail or

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.700 
way it wouldn't lose any detail or
anything<00:04:39.020> then<00:04:39.590> after<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:41.360> take<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.630> out<00:04:44.710> and

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
anything then after you take it out and

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.080 
anything then after you take it out and
you<00:04:45.800> might<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.190> pry<00:04:46.370> on<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:46.760> little<00:04:46.940> bit

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
you might have to pry on it a little bit

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.370 
you might have to pry on it a little bit
but<00:04:47.630> then<00:04:47.780> you're<00:04:47.930> gonna<00:04:48.020> have<00:04:48.230> this

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
you'd put cornstarch in there just a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.660 
you'd put cornstarch in there just a
