galore and everything like that it's
it's<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:48.090> amazing<00:01:48.299> been<00:01:49.290> searching<00:01:49.590> for

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it's pretty amazing been searching for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.990 
it's pretty amazing been searching for
one<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.040> seeds<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> while<00:01:50.790> I'm

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
one of these seeds for a while I'm

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
one of these seeds for a while I'm
really<00:01:51.030> happy<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.600> finally<00:01:51.990> found<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.710> surface

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
really happy I finally found a surface

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
really happy I finally found a surface
stronghold<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.420> next<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> spawn<00:01:55.219> with<00:01:56.219> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
stronghold right next to spawn with that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.510 
stronghold right next to spawn with that
so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.630> cool<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.280> does

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so I think it's really cool if this does

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.289 
so I think it's really cool if this does
not<00:01:59.670> count<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.270> surface<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:02.070> know

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
not count as surface then I don't know

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.020 
not count as surface then I don't know
you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.420> who<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.049> think<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.030> if

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you know who you think you are but if

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.290 
you know who you think you are but if
the<00:02:06.570> light<00:02:06.780> shines<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> surface<00:02:08.300> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the light shines on it it is surface so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
the light shines on it it is surface so
