okay<00:00:02.520> today<00:00:02.970> I'll<00:00:03.270> be<00:00:03.300> showing<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.140> set<00:00:04.560> up

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
okay today I'll be showing how to set up

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.059 
okay today I'll be showing how to set up
multiple<00:00:05.490> animation<00:00:06.330> tracks<00:00:06.919> with<00:00:07.919> this

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
multiple animation tracks with this

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.360 
multiple animation tracks with this
three-legged<00:00:09.059> character<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.050> made<00:00:10.370> and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
three-legged character that I made and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
three-legged character that I made and
we're<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> play<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.240> back<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.960> tundra

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
we're going to play them back in tundra

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.429 
we're going to play them back in tundra
to<00:00:15.470> first<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:18.439> set

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
to first thing we're going to do is set

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.340 
to first thing we're going to do is set
it<00:00:19.470> snowflake<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.490> action<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it snowflake the action so that it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.599 
it snowflake the action so that it
becomes<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.890> NLA<00:00:23.279> track<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:25.400> we're<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
becomes an NLA track and we're going to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.830 
becomes an NLA track and we're going to
set<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.150> time<00:00:27.660> range<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.590> NLA<00:00:29.160> strip<00:00:31.009> and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
set a time range for the NLA strip and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.660 
set a time range for the NLA strip and
I'll<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.110> duplicate<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> too<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.640> give<00:00:35.820> us

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
I'll just duplicate that too to give us

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.590 
I'll just duplicate that too to give us
two<00:00:38.670> more<00:00:38.820> strips<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> each<00:00:40.829> strip<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
two more strips so each strip is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
two more strips so each strip is
covering<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:43.050> different<00:00:43.739> range<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.840> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
covering a different range of this this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.369 
covering a different range of this this
animation

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.450 

so<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.399> select<00:00:50.640> everything<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.359> then<00:00:52.460> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so just select everything and then to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
so just select everything and then to
export<00:00:53.699> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.750 

okay<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.630> play<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.340> selected

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
okay so to play back to the selected

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.450 
okay so to play back to the selected
animation<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.230> played<00:01:34.950> back

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
animation to be played back

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.900 
animation to be played back
it's<00:01:35.940> whatever<00:01:36.530> strip<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.770> been<00:01:38.040> selected

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
it's whatever strip has been selected

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's whatever strip has been selected
here<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:40.080> be<00:01:41.240> played<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.510> here<00:01:43.050> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
here is what will be played back here in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.610 
here is what will be played back here in
tundra<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.350> select

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
tundra so we can just you just select

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.780 
tundra so we can just you just select
another<00:01:46.710> track<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.410> that's<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:50.400> track<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
another track and that's the track that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.760 
another track and that's the track that
would<00:01:50.940> be<00:01:51.030> played

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.330 

I'm<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:57.500> updating<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> timeline<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.310> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I'm also updating the timeline when I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.380 
I'm also updating the timeline when I
changed<00:02:00.299> my<00:02:00.450> selection<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
changed my selection because the way the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.919 
changed my selection because the way the
blender<00:02:04.140> communicates<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:05.100> tundra<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.299> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
blender communicates with tundra is it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.279 
blender communicates with tundra is it
needs<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.259> frame<00:02:07.469> update<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.360> send<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.569> signal

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
needs a frame update to send the signal

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.839 
needs a frame update to send the signal
to<00:02:10.319> change<00:02:11.900> animation<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:14.370> select

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
to change animation so you can select

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.240 
to change animation so you can select
and<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.420> rotate<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.900> view

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.370 

or<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:20.030> select<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.690> then<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.050> change

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
or you can select and then just change

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.330 
or you can select and then just change
the<00:02:21.530> timing<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.700> enough<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:25.190> can

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the timing that's good enough we can

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.010 
the timing that's good enough we can
also<00:02:25.570> set<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.080> influence<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
also set the the influence of the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.800 
also set the the influence of the
animation<00:02:30.020> track<00:02:30.400> down<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:31.850> go<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.210> animated

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
animation track down here go to animated

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.150 
animation track down here go to animated
influence<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.210> set<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.630> zero<00:02:36.590> three

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
influence and if we set it to zero three

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.110 
influence and if we set it to zero three
we'll<00:02:38.150> see<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.750> animation<00:02:39.460> is<00:02:40.460> playing

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
we'll see that the animation is playing

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.450 
we'll see that the animation is playing
back<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:43.090> reduced<00:02:44.090> influence<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.830> take<00:02:46.340> it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
back with reduced influence so take it

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.780 
back with reduced influence so take it
all<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> way<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.850> zero<00:02:47.720> one<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:49.070> hardly<00:02:49.520> see

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
all the way to zero one we hardly see

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.250 
all the way to zero one we hardly see
the<00:02:49.970> animation<00:02:50.450> anymore<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> back<00:02:52.910> up<00:02:53.180> we<00:02:54.080> take

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the animation anymore so back up we take

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.480 
the animation anymore so back up we take
it<00:02:54.410> back<00:02:54.440> up<00:02:54.830> higher

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.000 

and<00:02:59.790> back<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.690> fully<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and back to one we fully see the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.369 
and back to one we fully see the
animation

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
animation

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.309 
animation
I've<00:03:04.799> also<00:03:05.040> recently<00:03:05.849> added<00:03:07.879> real-time

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
I've also recently added real-time

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.300 
I've also recently added real-time
update<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.329> you<00:03:12.329> don't<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:13.310> re

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
update so you can you don't have to re

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.520 
update so you can you don't have to re
export<00:03:14.849> every<00:03:15.120> time<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.540> move<00:03:15.749> objects<00:03:16.290> or

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
export every time you move objects or

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.000 
export every time you move objects or
scale<00:03:17.129> then<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.959> simply<00:03:19.319> moving<00:03:19.530> them<00:03:19.829> in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
scale then just simply moving them in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.379 
scale then just simply moving them in
blender<00:03:21.109> is<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:23.609> all<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.969> you<00:03:24.090> really<00:03:24.239> need

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
blender is is all that you really need

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.240 
blender is is all that you really need
to<00:03:25.109> do<00:03:25.349> now

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
to do now

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.160 
to do now
there's<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.850> there's<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.330> bug<00:03:28.570> right<00:03:28.840> now<00:03:28.990> with

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
there's a there's one bug right now with

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.330 
there's a there's one bug right now with
rotation<00:03:29.740> but<00:03:30.630> fix<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.810> soon<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:33.190> just

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
rotation but fix that soon so it's just

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.440 
rotation but fix that soon so it's just
positioning<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.110> scaling<00:03:35.110> at<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.350> moment

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
positioning and scaling at the moment

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.840 
positioning and scaling at the moment
this<00:03:37.450> works<00:03:37.780> also<00:03:38.170> with<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.700> can

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
this works also with like so you can

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.550 
this works also with like so you can
move<00:03:40.030> these<00:03:40.300> these<00:03:41.050> lights<00:03:41.380> around<00:03:41.740> and<00:03:43.560> see

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
move these these lights around and see

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.210 
move these these lights around and see
their<00:03:44.770> effects<00:03:45.720> I've<00:03:46.720> also<00:03:46.930> added<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:50.380> few<00:03:51.160> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
their effects I've also added a few a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.850 
their effects I've also added a few a
few<00:03:51.430> settings<00:03:52.000> here<00:03:52.360> for<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:54.580> light<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:56.620> can

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
few settings here for the light we can

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.460 
few settings here for the light we can
increase<00:03:57.700> its<00:03:58.030> energy<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
increase its energy and see the the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.110 
increase its energy and see the the
effect<00:04:02.920> here

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.430 

and<00:04:08.330> also<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.140> distance<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.980> distance
