00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
spill a little bit on purpose so it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.949 
spill a little bit on purpose so it's
easier<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
easier to light because it is going to

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.949 
easier to light because it is going to
make<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> nice<00:02:22.350> proof<00:02:24.890> okay<00:02:26.480> Josh<00:02:27.480> spilled<00:02:27.810> over
