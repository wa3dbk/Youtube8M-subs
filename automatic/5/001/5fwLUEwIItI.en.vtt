00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.450
 what's up bruce my companions of the 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.089
 Spanish-speaking community here teddy 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.440
 live today we will talk about the 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.210
 youtubers that in my opinion are the most 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.130
 influential in the zombie community 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.230
 first of all I would like to thank you 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.240
 as anti serious which pride poker and in 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.039
 our dear friend roberto for 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.930
 give us not only this wonderful 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.580
 story that we all love but 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.350
 because they entertain us and they understand us and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.300
 Of course, once or twice 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.369
 they give advice for our lives 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.960
 I speak to you not only as an implicate 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.600
 more in this story in which all 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.670
 we are wrapped 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.710
 but with a step of the Hispanic community 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.420
 to show and prove yourself 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.150
 our first theme will be that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 rivalry that exists between 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.560
 Americans and English and our 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.610
 community thanks to this great story and 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.610
 the game itself 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.960
 we have come to light through 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.960
 Youtube 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.230
 which is very good because we give ourselves 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.510
 know and we prove that we can reach 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.490
 the goal that we can about being not 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.590
 I want to say that we are better in my 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.780
 opinion no one should believe more than another 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.740
 but the American community is given 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.570
 English have a certain criterion 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.240
 precisely because we have not given not us 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 we have made known is true the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 times have changed and now we have 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.460
 Representatives like good people 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 that I mentioned earlier 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.600
 there is no conflict or clash between both 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.240
 but if they occur and we see ourselves below 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.509
 I want to say that the goal is to reach 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.640
 that goal to be able to show that 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.840
 we are what we are made of and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 enjoy this story 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.030
 recently played the game and the clan ay 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.280
 they led an alliance in a certain way 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.750
 it leaves us in the same place 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 that is, recognition 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.370
 recognition will not be as such 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 defined it is important to show the great 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.630
 strength that we have as the community 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.700
 it is true that in the absence of organization and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.740
 but after all it 's a start 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.829
 very good since we are united 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.570
 something that we are passionate about is not about not 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.090
 it's just about killing zombies and it 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.709
 try to enjoy the mystery of what 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.720
 that causes you to look for a mystery or 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.569
 make theories of what will happen next 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 is the magic of this body in my opinion 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.880
 we have a lot to give a lot to show 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 and it's not that being selfish is showing that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.650
 we can 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 everyone decides what to think and what to do 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.500
 but if I tell you that the last one should be 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.670
 it's worth having our name 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 supported and fought those who think those who 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.110
 they think alike 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.330
 Moving on to the next topic 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.090
 which one do you think is the best youtuber in 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.100
 how zombies look at this is not about 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.140
 whose is better each one has its 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.550
 spark has its magic all 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.020
 they are definitely unique 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.720
 what is that good spark 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.840
 I'll start with Robert which he is 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.460
 Funny those videos literally like 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.710
 if everything was playing with him in the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.260
 moment in which you make them see you 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.300
 that important part so 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.490
 entertaining though definitely 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.220
 finish facebook 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.590
 it's a complete joy explains in a way 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.920
 very understandable the theories the most 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 of times 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.700
 in short his zombie story is a very 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.260
 good work is very complete and since 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.530
 took out the first chapter I hope to see the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.520
 the rest 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.950
 I will not talk about good 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.300
 Mr. Port agrees if it is that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.340
 they have followed gÃ¼icho for a long time 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 understand what I'm talking about 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.540
 one of the founders of the planet 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.000
 I really thought the idea was fascinating 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.349
 since he united many and made others aware 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.360
 they have to look for things by 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.860
 themselves or just let yourself be guided 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.630
 for the videos that they 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.630
 it's a big step for our community 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.700
 he is an admirable person and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.610
 definitely from anything with 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.590
 that magic and the one that will happen afterwards 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.110
 theories and group prophecy 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.420
 secret is amazing no one else is fixed 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.090
 in those things and explains them is a great 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.040
 work and very very very 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.200
 I think a great idea of 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.060
 generation gamer seems like a great idea 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.549
 how he manages his channel and in the community 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.350
 the truth always has you attentive 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.340
 explanation of what was the group 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.470
 secret is amazing 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.540
 no doubt exposes what nobody saw but 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.120
 it has a great importance 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.000
 if you eat not only congratulations 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.440
 but a great recognition 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.009
 I definitely appreciate my 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.789
 moment 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.789
 Robert 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 Roberto is Roberto in his own way 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.180
 show the way he shows you 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.669
 things makes you laugh and makes you 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.919
 Enjoy the game and explain you such 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.300
 way it looks like he's talking 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.490
 directly with you that you are playing 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 a game of newton or going back to 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.200
 start in hd on a totem but never 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.750
 lack hair or talk about when to be 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.030
 with wii shock but it really is 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.350
 impossible to stop watching and laugh 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.430
 understands very well how he explains his 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.230
 theories 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.580
 although he always comes out with his big 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.580
 notes that both have laughed 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.490
 something that these people have in common 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.560
 is that it is in a video of your friend in a 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.270
 exclusive video give us 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.210
 not only help us understand the 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.250
 history if we have doubts but we 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.790
 They show their opinion and share their 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.710
 experiences do not show show us 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.290
 that being yourself always leads you to be 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.030
 the one who carries the good do not criticize and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.050
 respect others 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.940
 nobody else nobody is more than another 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.389
 and that sometimes you should be careful with 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.389
 the sheets 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.190
 actually the community of the community 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.560
 Hispanic 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.840
 in the community it's good they 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.840
 they show something beyond 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.260
 if you are watching this video you should appreciate 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.050
 appreciate these people 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.139
 because they make an effort 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.169
 A big effort 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.819
 for bringing us not only history 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.860
 that surrounds us all but that we 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:22.219
 bring entertainment be challenges in 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.820
 game modes and everything all the time we 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.830
 they have earrings they have us laughing 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.000
 they are amazing personally 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.340
 I appreciate very much what they have done 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.150
 well my bros my brothers of the 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.600
 Hispanic community 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.470
 very soon I will upload another video continuing 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:46.130
 with this beautiful and had the experience 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.960
 what is this zombie story that 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.120
 everyone joins us 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.580
 and let's go forward 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.050
 we come forward and to get to 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.050
 achieve that goal
