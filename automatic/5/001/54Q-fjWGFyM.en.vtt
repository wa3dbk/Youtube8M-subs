00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.460
 you see a white box in this box is a very mysterious 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.049
 the device 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.119
 whole secret what is he then not this is this 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:20.189
 GCC 35 30 or just Samsung C35 30 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.699
 and I take it out of the box 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
 I open up years 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.149
 and that is the device 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.609
 that's how it looks 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.380
 and it feels like a stable heart 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 Jamie Lynn a protective film there together 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.830
 how so 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.960
 and it's very narrow you can see it rounded here 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 is very nice in the hand is relatively easy 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.160
 Here has been processed to be called for plastic even though 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 some people will write out now was my first impression that this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.080
 Device to one or the other nokia devices Renault 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.200
 that's the get together and c35 30 it's a quad band device and 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.560
 so that the measurements can be one hundred 12 mm. May 47 mm. May 12 millimeters 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 thickest point and from outside ten million a 3 point 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.770
 5-millimeter socket for headphones 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 then we have covered here under these 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.380
 once the entrance for the micro SPK wants on the left we have one 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.980
 Volume rocker on the right nicely into a little evil 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.220
 Yemen have the one three-chamber 2-megapixel camera Kissel pronounce 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.370
 is Samsung 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.010
 here is the keyboard 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.090
 otherwise we have nothing here that is that devices with look now once 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 what is included in this scope and there we have it all 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.440
 the headphones with 305 millimeter clinker 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.380
 and of course you can use these substances or your own 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 because they also fit the device 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 yes, but here you have the opportunity to take a call as well 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.370
 we have a charger here 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.420
 so that goes beyond micro usb port and we have a HQ here and ultimately it is 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.280
 for a militia officer and 960 billion heavy hour to red that is 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 on the packaging and even winds up a ACOD promises one 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.400
 Talk time of about 13 can be three hours 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.719
 and standby mode is supposed to hold the device 26 for seven days 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.799
 The device has an internal memory of 50 megawatts and this memory 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.530
 expandable up to 32 gigabytes Panico sd card I have it now 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.749
 Men's choir, because this is how the device looks from the inside, here comes the sim card 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.209
 I just put it here 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.059
 communicated under this process 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:50.749
 so now over nine years of the acutely know the plans over it 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.680
 and again this battery cover is 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.069
 four races are meat and not meat 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.159
 Slide the battery cover through 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.540
 Snap the device into a 90 gram weighs it still is 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.370

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.209
 beautiful 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.589
