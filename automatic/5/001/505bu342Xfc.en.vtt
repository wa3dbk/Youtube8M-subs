00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
almost at random there we go and I can

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.670 
almost at random there we go and I can
use<00:02:16.909> my<00:02:16.939> arrow<00:02:17.389> keys<00:02:17.510> now

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
just sort of cycling through each one of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.670 
just sort of cycling through each one of
these<00:02:22.909> fonts<00:02:23.269> until<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.870> find<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> one<00:02:24.439> that<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
perspective view and you can see here

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.339 
perspective view and you can see here
this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:47.000> dark<00:02:47.599> purple<00:02:48.019> color<00:02:48.230> which

this is a dark purple color which
doesn't<00:02:48.620> really<00:02:48.680> show<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.129> very<00:02:49.310> well<00:02:49.400> against

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879

my backdrop here so what I'll do is I'll

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.610 
my backdrop here so what I'll do is I'll
come<00:02:52.340> up<00:02:52.370> here<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:52.669> the<00:02:52.879> color<00:02:53.480> box<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:54.349> click

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
on that and i'll give that a much

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.140 
on that and i'll give that a much
lighter<00:02:56.780> color<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.799> moment<00:02:57.950> there<00:02:58.939> we<00:02:59.030> go

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
lighter color for the moment there we go

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.190 
lighter color for the moment there we go
that's<00:02:59.329> easier<00:02:59.659> to<00:02:59.689> see<00:02:59.959> isn't<00:03:00.169> it<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.840> I've

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
that's easier to see isn't it so I've

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.709 
that's easier to see isn't it so I've

got my text I've got my font I can play
around<00:03:05.959> with<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.409> size<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.889> it<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.700> want<00:03:07.909> to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
around with the size of it if I want to

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.440 
around with the size of it if I want to
I<00:03:08.439> can<00:03:09.439> play<00:03:09.859> around<00:03:10.010> with<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.519> kerning<00:03:11.299> as

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
I can play around with the kerning as

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.390 
I can play around with the kerning as
well<00:03:11.810> which<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.379> space<00:03:12.709> between<00:03:13.010> each

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
well which is the space between each

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.059 
well which is the space between each
letter<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:14.659> can<00:03:14.900> really<00:03:15.109> kind<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.439> pull<00:03:15.859> that

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
letter so I can really kind of pull that

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.589 
letter so I can really kind of pull that
back<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.579> if<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.819> want<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.299> want<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.450> make

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
back in if I want to if I want to make

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.030 
back in if I want to if I want to make
that<00:03:17.750> look<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.049> feel<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.319> little<00:03:18.500> bit<00:03:18.620> cramped

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
that look and feel a little bit cramped

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.059 
that look and feel a little bit cramped
I<00:03:19.129> can<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:21.200> spread<00:03:21.469> it<00:03:21.620> back<00:03:21.739> out<00:03:21.889> again

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
I can do I can spread it back out again

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.740 
I can do I can spread it back out again
if<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:23.060> had<00:03:23.090> multi-line<00:03:23.870> text<00:03:24.699> which<00:03:25.699> is<00:03:25.970> very

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
if I had multi-line text which is very

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.180 
if I had multi-line text which is very
easy<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.139> have<00:03:27.409> I<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:30.560> also<00:03:30.709> change<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
easy to have I can also change the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.149 
easy to have I can also change the
leading<00:03:31.639> which<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.479> the<00:03:32.810> space<00:03:33.229> between<00:03:33.680> each

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
leading which is the space between each

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.189 
leading which is the space between each
one<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:36.099> lines<00:03:37.099> here<00:03:37.629> there<00:03:38.629> we<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:38.989> let's

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
one of the lines here there we go let's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.319 
one of the lines here there we go let's
just<00:03:39.409> keep<00:03:39.560> doing<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:39.979> there<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.639> go<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.209> we

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
just keep doing that there we go so we

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.780 
just keep doing that there we go so we
can<00:03:41.479> really<00:03:41.720> sort<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.079> bunch<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.099> text<00:03:43.519> up<00:03:43.639> if

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
can really sort of bunch this text up if

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.360 
can really sort of bunch this text up if
we<00:03:43.939> want<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> or<00:03:44.479> we<00:03:45.409> could<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:45.680> delete<00:03:46.159> each

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
we want to or we could just delete each

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.420 
we want to or we could just delete each
one<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.639> these<00:03:46.790> lines<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.949> get<00:03:48.949> rid<00:03:49.099> of<00:03:49.129> there

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
one of these lines and get rid of there

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.300 
one of these lines and get rid of there
we<00:03:49.519> go<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:50.720> now<00:03:50.750> I've<00:03:51.049> got<00:03:51.199> my<00:03:51.319> 2d<00:03:51.680> text<00:03:52.159> and

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
I press f4 here I can add a couple of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.340 
I press f4 here I can add a couple of
segments<00:04:50.920> into<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.010> height<00:04:52.250> there<00:04:53.200> there<00:04:54.200> we

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
segments into the height there there we

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.560 
segments into the height there there we
go<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.860> can<00:04:55.000> bend<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.390> there's<00:04:56.510> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
go to so I can bend that and there's a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.310 
go to so I can bend that and there's a
little<00:04:56.690> bit<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:56.900> room<00:04:57.650> for<00:04:57.890> flexibility<00:04:59.320> and

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
little bit of room for flexibility and

what I'll now do is I'll now apply

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.110 
what I'll now do is I'll now apply
another<00:05:02.150> modifier<00:05:02.660> which<00:05:03.230> was<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.620> bend<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.160> am

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
another modifier which was the bend I am

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.730 
another modifier which was the bend I am
going<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.540> put<00:05:05.720> that<00:05:05.930> in<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:07.210> x-direction<00:05:08.740> at

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
going to put that in the x-direction at

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.470 
going to put that in the x-direction at
minus<00:05:10.720> 90<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:12.110> as<00:05:12.230> a<00:05:12.260> rough<00:05:12.530> guess<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.480> I'm

minus 90 just as a rough guess and I'm

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.880 
minus 90 just as a rough guess and I'm
going<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.720> give<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:15.020> negative<00:05:15.590> binned

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
going to give that a negative binned

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.190 
going to give that a negative binned
value<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.780> as<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.770> can<00:05:18.950> see<00:05:18.980> here<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:20.200> pull

value and as you can see here I pull

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.650 
value and as you can see here I pull
that<00:05:21.350> round<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.770> about<00:05:22.130> 180<00:05:25.240> let's<00:05:26.240> just<00:05:26.480> keep

just added in real time piece of 2d
texts<00:06:16.280> that<00:06:16.400> because<00:06:16.640> we've<00:06:16.790> got<00:06:16.940> an<00:06:17.000> extrude

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
texts that because we've got an extrude

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.170 
texts that because we've got an extrude
and<00:06:17.540> a<00:06:17.570> bend<00:06:17.810> it<00:06:18.560> just<00:06:18.890> went<00:06:19.160> into<00:06:19.430> that<00:06:19.880> bend

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
and a bend it just went into that bend

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.570 
and a bend it just went into that bend
into<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:20.840> text<00:06:21.200> absolutely<00:06:21.830> perfectly<00:06:22.310> in

the correct type font exactly how it
should<00:06:26.090> be<00:06:26.470> it's<00:06:27.470> as<00:06:27.620> simple<00:06:27.800> as<00:06:27.980> that

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
should be it's as simple as that

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.430 
should be it's as simple as that
diseases<00:06:28.730> that<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:29.030> produce<00:06:29.150> if<00:06:29.510> you're

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
diseases that to produce if you're

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
edges of this text what I would say is

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.410 
edges of this text what I would say is
flick<00:06:35.780> forward<00:06:36.170> to<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:37.640> materials<00:06:38.210> section

flick forward to the materials section

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.560 
flick forward to the materials section
of<00:06:38.720> these<00:06:39.110> tutorials<00:06:39.710> and<00:06:40.130> you'll<00:06:41.030> find<00:06:41.270> in

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
of these tutorials and you'll find in

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.770 
of these tutorials and you'll find in
there<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:42.650> one<00:06:43.640> of<00:06:43.700> the<00:06:43.790> buttons<00:06:43.910> in<00:06:44.240> one<00:06:44.630> of<00:06:44.660> the

there a one of the buttons in one of the

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.719 
there a one of the buttons in one of the
materials<00:06:45.230> that<00:06:45.320> will

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
materials that will

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.499 
materials that will
it's<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:47.009> mental<00:06:48.009> ray<00:06:48.389> architecture<00:06:49.389> and

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
it's the mental ray architecture and

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.119 
it's the mental ray architecture and
design<00:06:49.689> materials<00:06:50.139> there's<00:06:50.349> a<00:06:50.439> button<00:06:50.949> in

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
design materials there's a button in

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.489 
design materials there's a button in
there<00:06:51.309> that<00:06:51.849> will<00:06:51.939> allow<00:06:52.210> you<00:06:52.270> to<00:06:52.569> have<00:06:52.689> pseudo

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:53.499 
there that will allow you to have pseudo

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:55.019 
there that will allow you to have pseudo
beveling<00:06:53.949> on<00:06:54.099> the<00:06:54.249> edges<00:06:54.520> so<00:06:54.669> you<00:06:54.729> don't<00:06:54.939> have

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.029 
beveling on the edges so you don't have

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:56.629 
beveling on the edges so you don't have
to<00:06:55.180> worry<00:06:55.360> about<00:06:55.479> putting<00:06:55.719> in<00:06:56.020> your<00:06:56.080> geometry

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
to worry about putting in your geometry

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.189 
to worry about putting in your geometry
really<00:06:57.639> nice<00:06:57.759> really<00:06:58.240> simple<00:06:58.659> really<00:06:59.020> great

really nice really simple really great
way<00:06:59.349> of<00:06:59.379> doing<00:06:59.680> things

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.990
