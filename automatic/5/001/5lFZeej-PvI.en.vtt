00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
I once again this is Jim from the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.780 
I once again this is Jim from the
seducing<00:00:04.620> robot<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.190> we're<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.670> to

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
seducing robot and now we're going to

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.880 
seducing robot and now we're going to
try<00:00:06.060> out<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.450> developer<00:00:06.689> unit<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.680> leap

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
try out the developer unit of the leap

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.020 
try out the developer unit of the leap
motion<00:00:08.069> controller<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
motion controller so here we have the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
motion controller so here we have the
leap<00:00:12.179> motion<00:00:12.360> controller<00:00:12.620> and<00:00:13.700> we're<00:00:14.700> gonna

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
leap motion controller and we're gonna

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.510 
leap motion controller and we're gonna
connect<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> computer<00:00:15.750> by<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.520> USB

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
connect it to the computer by the USB

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.650 
connect it to the computer by the USB
cable<00:00:17.700> that<00:00:17.939> came<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> package<00:00:20.660> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
cable that came in with the package just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.240 
cable that came in with the package just
there<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> light<00:00:25.349> indicates<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.039> it's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
there so the light indicates that it's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.939 
there so the light indicates that it's
connected<00:00:26.789> okay<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> run<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
connected okay now we have to run the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
connected okay now we have to run the
leap<00:00:29.220> software<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.720> I'm<00:00:33.930> running

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
leap software so right now I'm running

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.340 
leap software so right now I'm running
the<00:00:34.560> leap<00:00:35.010> software<00:00:35.730> version<00:00:36.300> zero<00:00:36.870> point

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the leap software version zero point

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.500 
the leap software version zero point
seven<00:00:37.980> point<00:00:38.580> three<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.580> here<00:00:41.880> we<00:00:42.060> have<00:00:42.240> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
seven point three so the here we have is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.680 
seven point three so the here we have is
the<00:00:43.050> leap<00:00:43.320> visualizer<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> shows<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the leap visualizer so shows you the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
the leap visualizer so shows you the
tracking<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.260> each<00:00:46.530> fingers<00:00:46.950> each<00:00:47.580> finger

with<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> different<00:00:49.440> color<00:00:49.650> so<00:00:50.160> I've<00:00:50.880> tried<00:00:51.150> up

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
with a different color so I've tried up

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.130 
with a different color so I've tried up
to<00:00:51.630> ten<00:00:51.810> fingers<00:00:53.690> tracks<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> pretty

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to ten fingers tracks it pretty

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.280 
to ten fingers tracks it pretty
accurately<00:00:56.000> yeah<00:00:57.320> all<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.890> movement<00:00:59.310> is<00:00:59.460> red

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
accurately yeah all the movement is red

me now in order to run touch emulation

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.430 
me now in order to run touch emulation
we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> run<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.949> two<00:01:05.189> applications<00:01:05.339> oh

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
we have to run these two applications oh

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.320 
we have to run these two applications oh

you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.310> run<00:01:18.180> touch<00:01:18.810> emulation<00:01:19.440> without

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you can run touch emulation without

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.490 
you can run touch emulation without
having<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.310> install<00:01:20.430> anything<00:01:20.820> else<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> let's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
having to install anything else so let's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.300 
having to install anything else so let's
start<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> service<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.730> for<00:01:24.570> touch<00:01:24.780> emulation

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
start the service to for touch emulation

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
start the service to for touch emulation
and<00:01:26.810> we'll<00:01:27.810> try<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.230> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> Windows

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and we'll try it out in the Windows

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.620 
and we'll try it out in the Windows
Start<00:01:29.040> screen

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
Start screen

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.950

there<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:31.050> swipe<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:32.000> run<00:01:33.000> applications

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.570 

let's<00:01:36.960> go<00:01:37.170> back<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> start<00:01:37.800> rate<00:01:37.980> and<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.550> can

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
let's go back to start rate and you can

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.940 
let's go back to start rate and you can
also<00:01:38.820> move<00:01:39.090> around<00:01:39.920> near<00:01:40.920> tiles<00:01:44.030> there<00:01:45.950> now

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
also move around near tiles there now

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
also move around near tiles there now
let's<00:01:47.340> try<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.760> an<00:01:48.150> application

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
let's try it on an application

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.490 
let's try it on an application
let's<00:01:49.680> try<00:01:49.979> fresh<00:01:50.370> paint<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.320> fresh

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
let's try fresh paint so the fresh

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.930 
brains is a Windows Store application
it's<00:01:54.870> used<00:01:55.440> for<00:01:55.710> painting<00:01:58.490> usually<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.700> do

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it's used for painting usually you do

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.399 
it's used for painting usually you do
this<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> touchscreen<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.870> here<00:02:01.229> we're

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this on a touchscreen but here we're

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.800 
this on a touchscreen but here we're
using<00:02:01.440> gestures<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.229> control<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> brush

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
using gestures to you control the brush

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.309 
using gestures to you control the brush
so<00:02:06.810> let's<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.260> paint<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.799> area

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.390 

okay<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.209> see<00:02:15.329> it's<00:02:15.599> pretty<00:02:15.810> accurate

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.130 

now<00:02:20.400> let's<00:02:20.730> try<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.390> maps<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:24.870> zoom

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
now let's try it on the maps I can zoom

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.440 
now let's try it on the maps I can zoom
in<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.890> swipe<00:02:26.370> around<00:02:28.609> so<00:02:29.609> now<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.239> can

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
in and swipe around so now you can

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.289 
in and swipe around so now you can
control<00:02:30.750> your<00:02:31.109> screen<00:02:31.680> without<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.299> things

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
control your screen without the things

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.490 
control your screen without the things
happening<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.900> your<00:02:33.959> screen<00:02:34.349> without

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
happening in your screen without

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.569 
happening in your screen without
touching<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.730> zoom<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.450> zoom<00:02:36.480> out

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
touching it and zoom in and zoom out

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.050 
touching it and zoom in and zoom out
okay<00:02:38.579> let's<00:02:39.239> write<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.569> fruit<00:02:39.810> ninja<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.790> this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
okay let's write on fruit ninja so this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.199 
okay let's write on fruit ninja so this
was<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:42.599> be<00:02:42.690> seen<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.079> leaf<00:02:43.260> motion

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
was can be seen in the leaf motion

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.160 
was can be seen in the leaf motion
website<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:46.109> like<00:02:47.090> didn't<00:02:48.090> show<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.569> do

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
website just like didn't show you can do
