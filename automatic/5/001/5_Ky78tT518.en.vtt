00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
inventory here's how it works a row of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
inventory here's how it works a row of
Pistons<00:00:35.309> hold<00:00:35.520> back<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.910> line<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> water

the<00:00:39.239> hour-long<00:00:39.570> timer<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> control

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the hour-long timer we use to control

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340 
the hour-long timer we use to control
Pistons<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> double<00:00:42.000> hopper<00:00:42.329> clock<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
Pistons is a double hopper clock this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
Pistons is a double hopper clock this
hopper<00:00:43.710> clock<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.129> itself<00:00:44.430> sends<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.910> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
hopper clock by itself sends a very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
hopper clock by itself sends a very
short<00:00:45.450> pulse<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> use<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> pulse<00:00:46.829> extender

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
short pulse so we use a pulse extender

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
short pulse so we use a pulse extender
to<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:48.000> sure<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> Pistons<00:00:48.690> remain<00:00:48.989> open<00:00:49.350> for

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to make sure the Pistons remain open for

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
to make sure the Pistons remain open for
about<00:00:49.710> six<00:00:50.039> seconds<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:51.090> gives<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> water

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
about six seconds this gives the water

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
about six seconds this gives the water
streams<00:00:51.899> time<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> fully<00:00:52.530> push<00:00:52.800> all<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> crops

works<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> line<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> dirt<00:01:25.650> which<00:01:25.830> will

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
works this is a line of dirt which will

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
works this is a line of dirt which will
be<00:01:26.130> our<00:01:26.159> farmland<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.210> needs<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
be our farmland but it needs to be

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
be our farmland but it needs to be
hydrated<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.130> water<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.640> far

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
hydrated we want our water to be far

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
hydrated we want our water to be far
enough<00:01:29.970> away<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.720> flow<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
enough away that it will flow for a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.510 
enough away that it will flow for a
decent<00:01:31.590> amount<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> time<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.250> close<00:01:32.490> enough

to the farmland and after that place our

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.010 
to the farmland and after that place our
Pistons<00:01:51.640> where<00:01:51.940> they<00:01:52.119> can<00:01:52.270> hold<00:01:52.479> back<00:01:52.780> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
by ethoslab but of course they were

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.920 
by ethoslab but of course they were

this timer set up last about an hour a
little<00:04:35.510> longer<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.110> we're<00:04:36.350> keeping<00:04:36.620> our<00:04:36.830> math

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010

will fire off one very short tick which

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.719 
will fire off one very short tick which
is<00:04:42.410> why<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.040> set<00:04:43.190> up<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> polls

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729
