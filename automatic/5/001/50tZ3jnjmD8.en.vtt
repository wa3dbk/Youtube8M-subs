up<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.460> three<00:02:55.820> months<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:59.080> um<00:03:00.760> I'm<00:03:01.760> going<00:03:01.940> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
up to three months so um I'm going to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
up to three months so um I'm going to
have<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.240> look<00:03:02.510> at<00:03:02.660> some<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.080> other<00:03:03.110> sizes

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
have to look at some of the other sizes

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.500 
have to look at some of the other sizes
and<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:05.270> think<00:03:05.600> probably<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:06.710> know<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.490> newborn<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
and I think probably I know a newborn is

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
and I think probably I know a newborn is
not<00:03:08.960> going<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.410> fit<00:03:09.650> him<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> think

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
not going to fit him but I think

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.090 
not going to fit him but I think
probably<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:11.210> size<00:03:11.960> one<00:03:12.550> may<00:03:13.550> work<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:14.150> him<00:03:15.100> so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
probably a size one may work for him so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.250 
probably a size one may work for him so
when<00:03:16.310> he's<00:03:16.490> through<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.850> his<00:03:17.030> bottle<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:17.810> will

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
when he's through with his bottle I will

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.400 
when he's through with his bottle I will
do<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.860> close-up<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.760> his<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.360> hands<00:03:21.080> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
