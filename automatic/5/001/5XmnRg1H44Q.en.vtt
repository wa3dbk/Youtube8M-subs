you<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.289> with<00:00:16.369> basically<00:00:17.369> like

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
you can do this is with basically like

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.390 
you can do this is with basically like
an<00:00:17.699> elgato<00:00:18.240> game<00:00:18.330> capture<00:00:18.539> card<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.770> has<00:00:20.039> in

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
an elgato game capture card that has in

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.929 
an elgato game capture card that has in
software<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:22.289> ability<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> stream<00:00:23.430> like

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
software the ability to stream like

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
software the ability to stream like
built-in<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.740> cool

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
built-in which i think is really cool

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.150 
built-in which i think is really cool
it's<00:00:26.369> honestly<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> easiest<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:29.070> not

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
it's honestly the easiest way but not

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.740 
it's honestly the easiest way but not
everybody<00:00:29.670> has<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.480> our<00:00:30.599> game

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
it's not that bad

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's not that bad
now<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> room<00:01:22.189> which

is<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.610> thing<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> sucks<00:01:24.720> about

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
is one thing that kind of sucks about

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
is one thing that kind of sucks about
this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.250> boxes<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:27.000> up

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
configuration profile that should be

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.050 
configuration profile that should be
where<00:02:07.879> it<00:02:08.879> has<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.750> link<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.200> download<00:02:10.319> this

it will show that cam twist is under the
video<00:02:17.160> device<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.210> audio<00:02:18.450> device<00:02:18.960> it

has sound flower selected but we'll talk

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.920 
has sound flower selected but we'll talk
about<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.450> after<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:22.070> while<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.720> do

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
about that after a while now what I do

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530 
about that after a while now what I do
is<00:02:25.410> open<00:02:26.070> up<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> elgato<00:02:26.640> game<00:02:26.700> capture<00:02:26.910> card

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
is open up the elgato game capture card

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.400 
is open up the elgato game capture card
and<00:02:27.780> click<00:02:28.590> desktop<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:30.450> cam<00:02:30.690> twist<00:02:31.020> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and click desktop with cam twist and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.780 
and click desktop with cam twist and
then<00:02:31.710> use<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.530> resizable<00:02:34.530> selection<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
then use the resizable selection to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
then use the resizable selection to
basically<00:02:37.940> square<00:02:38.940> off<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.780> gameplay<00:02:40.440> just

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
basically square off the gameplay just

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.600 
basically square off the gameplay just
by<00:02:41.220> itself<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:43.320> what<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.070> would<00:02:44.280> do

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
by itself and then what you would do

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.310 
by itself and then what you would do
with<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.950> picture-in-picture<00:02:46.950> webcam<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.320> you

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
with a picture-in-picture webcam is you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.570 
with a picture-in-picture webcam is you
would<00:02:50.600> basically<00:02:51.600> hit<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.110> PRP<00:02:52.530> button<00:02:53.010> after

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
would basically hit the PRP button after

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.600 
would basically hit the PRP button after
you<00:02:54.150> select<00:02:54.450> webcam<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.320> there's<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> webcam

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610

you select webcam and there's the webcam
hello<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:58.260> once<00:02:59.190> you've<00:02:59.370> sectioned<00:03:00.060> off<00:03:00.180> what

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
hello and once you've sectioned off what

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.350 
hello and once you've sectioned off what
you<00:03:00.840> want<00:03:01.110> recorded<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.890> your<00:03:02.160> desktop<00:03:02.610> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
picture and resize it and it's got tons

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380 
picture and resize it and it's got tons
of<00:03:11.010> settings<00:03:11.220> over<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> right<00:03:12.090> side

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
of settings over here on the right side

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.800 
of settings over here on the right side
where<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.990> can<00:03:13.200> kind<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.740> make<00:03:14.070> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
where you can kind of like make the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.100 
where you can kind of like make the
image<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.920> webcam<00:03:17.310> square<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.330> then<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
image of the webcam square and then you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.930 
image of the webcam square and then you
can<00:03:19.290> shrink<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.370> move<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.910> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
can shrink it and then move it to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.400 
can shrink it and then move it to
wherever<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.959> would<00:03:22.110> like

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
wherever you would like

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.240 
wherever you would like
so<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.830> usually<00:03:23.810> move<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.709> corner<00:03:26.070> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
so I usually move it to the corner of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.670 
so I usually move it to the corner of
the<00:03:26.700> gameplay<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.540> have<00:03:27.720> sectioned<00:03:28.170> off

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.020 

and<00:03:31.680> I'm<00:03:31.830> just<00:03:32.100> kind<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.340> messing<00:03:32.730> with<00:03:32.760> these

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and I'm just kind of messing with these

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.990 
and I'm just kind of messing with these
settings<00:03:33.300> right<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:34.430> just<00:03:35.430> kind<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.670> making

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
settings right here just kind of making

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.699 
settings right here just kind of making
it<00:03:36.120> look<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.450> how<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> would<00:03:37.110> normally<00:03:37.380> make

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
it look like how I would normally make

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.620 
it look like how I would normally make
it<00:03:38.010> look<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> stream<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.330> yeah<00:03:39.450> that's

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
it look for a stream but yeah that's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.510 
it look for a stream but yeah that's
what<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.870> do<00:03:39.990> just<00:03:40.380> square<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:40.770> off<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.340> then

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
what I do just square it off and then

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.720 
what I do just square it off and then
you<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.910> drag<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.260> move<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.580> wherever

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
you can drag it and move it to wherever

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.970 
you can drag it and move it to wherever
you<00:03:45.150> would<00:03:45.270> like<00:03:45.380> obviously<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.560> would<00:03:46.740> move

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
you would like obviously you would move

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.900 
you would like obviously you would move
it<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.490> where<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.300> need<00:03:49.280> needn't<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.520> your

it to where you need needn't on your

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.670 
it to where you need needn't on your
stream<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:55.100> desktop<00:03:56.100> capture

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
stream because the desktop capture

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.420 
stream because the desktop capture
selectable<00:03:58.680> area<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.340> only<00:03:59.760> gonna<00:04:00.120> show<00:04:01.430> what

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
selectable area is only gonna show what

selectable area is only gonna show what
you<00:04:02.580> want<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> yeah<00:04:04.320> I'm<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.500> moving<00:04:05.100> this

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
you want so yeah I'm just moving this

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.180 
you want so yeah I'm just moving this
around<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.480> move<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.780> anywhere<00:04:07.190> any

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
around and you can move it anywhere any

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.979 
around and you can move it anywhere any
corner<00:04:08.550> you<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.360> normally<00:04:09.840> this

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
corner you like but normally this

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.810 
corner you like but normally this
wouldn't<00:04:10.230> be<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.500> full<00:04:10.739> desktop<00:04:10.980> this<00:04:11.580> would

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
wouldn't be in full desktop this would

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.270 
wouldn't be in full desktop this would
be<00:04:12.060> sectioned<00:04:12.690> off<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.830> display<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
be sectioned off to just display the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.539 
be sectioned off to just display the
gameplay<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:15.380> don't<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.709> open<00:04:17.100> just

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
gameplay I don't have that open just

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.970 
gameplay I don't have that open just
because<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.359> Oh<00:04:18.390> godoh<00:04:18.720> Game<00:04:19.020> Capture<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.770> so

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
because the Oh godoh Game Capture is so

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.020 
because the Oh godoh Game Capture is so
big<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.400> would<00:04:20.459> take<00:04:20.609> up<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.760> whole<00:04:20.850> screen

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
big it would take up the whole screen

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.090 
big it would take up the whole screen
and<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.049> would<00:04:22.169> have<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> hard<00:04:22.560> time<00:04:22.590> kind<00:04:23.040> of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and I would have a hard time kind of

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.540 
and I would have a hard time kind of
showing<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.550> tutorial<00:04:24.320> anyway<00:04:25.320> so

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
showing this tutorial anyway so

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.950 
showing this tutorial anyway so
let's<00:04:28.550> see<00:04:28.790> now<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.060> you've<00:04:29.360> got<00:04:29.540> that<00:04:29.750> down

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
let's see now that you've got that down

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.689 
let's see now that you've got that down
let's<00:04:30.500> go<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.330> configuration<00:04:32.330> profile

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
let's go to the configuration profile

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.730 
let's go to the configuration profile
basically<00:04:34.699> you<00:04:35.150> want<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:36.470> your<00:04:36.590> browser

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
conjunction make the sound on Twitch but

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.320 
conjunction make the sound on Twitch but
yeah<00:06:58.849> that<00:06:59.599> is<00:07:00.219> pretty<00:07:01.219> much<00:07:01.490> how<00:07:01.550> you<00:07:01.819> do<00:07:02.180> it

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
yeah that is pretty much how you do it

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.149 
yeah that is pretty much how you do it
and<00:07:02.599> those<00:07:02.840> are<00:07:02.870> the<00:07:03.110> four<00:07:03.319> programs<00:07:03.530> that<00:07:04.039> you

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159 
and those are the four programs that you

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.480 
and those are the four programs that you
need<00:07:05.259> like<00:07:06.259> I<00:07:06.409> said<00:07:06.620> they're<00:07:06.860> all<00:07:06.889> free<00:07:07.340> to

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
need like I said they're all free to

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.080 
need like I said they're all free to
download<00:07:07.610> I<00:07:08.300> will<00:07:08.810> link<00:07:08.990> them<00:07:09.259> below<00:07:09.439> I<00:07:10.090> do

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
download I will link them below I do

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.240 
download I will link them below I do
think<00:07:11.569> that<00:07:11.629> this<00:07:11.960> is<00:07:12.139> kind<00:07:12.650> of<00:07:12.770> a<00:07:12.889> complicated

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
think that this is kind of a complicated

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.839 
think that this is kind of a complicated
way<00:07:13.819> to<00:07:13.879> do<00:07:14.360> it<00:07:14.599> but<00:07:14.990> you<00:07:15.289> do<00:07:15.560> get<00:07:16.520> to<00:07:16.669> have<00:07:16.819> a

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 
way to do it but you do get to have a

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:19.119 
way to do it but you do get to have a
little<00:07:17.150> more<00:07:17.300> fun<00:07:17.599> with<00:07:17.750> it<00:07:17.870> I<00:07:18.020> guess<00:07:18.050> you<00:07:18.650> can

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:19.129 
little more fun with it I guess you can

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:21.100 
little more fun with it I guess you can
do<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.460> overlays<00:07:19.909> and<00:07:20.330> you<00:07:20.419> can<00:07:20.599> certainly<00:07:20.810> do

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
do the overlays and you can certainly do

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.899 
do the overlays and you can certainly do
picture-in-picture<00:07:21.469> if<00:07:22.159> you<00:07:22.370> want<00:07:22.639> your

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:22.909 
picture-in-picture if you want your

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.240 
picture-in-picture if you want your
audience<00:07:23.270> to<00:07:23.509> be<00:07:23.629> able<00:07:23.780> to<00:07:23.900> see<00:07:24.169> you

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
audience to be able to see you

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.559 
audience to be able to see you
I<00:07:26.169> definitely<00:07:27.310> think<00:07:28.310> using<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.150> Oh<00:07:29.270> godoh

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:29.569 
I definitely think using the Oh godoh

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.230 
I definitely think using the Oh godoh
game<00:07:29.840> capture<00:07:30.289> card<00:07:30.530> is<00:07:30.800> much<00:07:31.129> easier<00:07:31.550> and<00:07:31.940> I

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
game capture card is much easier and I

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.510 
game capture card is much easier and I
really<00:07:32.629> recommend<00:07:33.050> it<00:07:33.229> if<00:07:33.560> you<00:07:34.099> don't<00:07:34.340> already

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
really recommend it if you don't already

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.059 
really recommend it if you don't already
have<00:07:34.789> a<00:07:35.029> game<00:07:35.419> capture<00:07:35.840> card<00:07:36.080> it<00:07:36.379> works<00:07:36.740> great

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 
have a game capture card it works great

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:39.519 
have a game capture card it works great

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.219 
with the Mac but if you don't want to
use<00:07:39.680> that<00:07:39.889> and<00:07:40.099> you<00:07:40.189> have<00:07:40.400> something<00:07:40.819> else

use that and you have something else
