freezing the boss zombie here in this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.190 
freezing the boss zombie here in this
tunnel<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.610> it<00:00:31.790> creates<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.210> pilot<00:00:32.660> behind<00:00:33.020> him

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
tunnel and it creates a pilot behind him

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.260 
tunnel and it creates a pilot behind him
this<00:00:33.739> is<00:00:33.890> great<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.190> solo<00:00:34.430> or<00:00:34.670> team<00:00:34.940> or<00:00:35.180> you

this is great on solo or team or you
could<00:00:35.420> just<00:00:35.450> use<00:00:35.809> this<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.110> make<00:00:36.200> him<00:00:36.380> freeze

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
could just use this to make him freeze

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.840 
could just use this to make him freeze
and<00:00:36.920> kill<00:00:37.160> them<00:00:37.309> if<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.460> want<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.670> get<00:00:37.760> them

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
can turn around and then move slightly

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.380 
can turn around and then move slightly
to<00:01:27.259> your<00:01:27.380> left<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.950> that's<00:01:28.550> going<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.880> put<00:01:29.149> his

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
to your left and that's going to put his

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.680 
to your left and that's going to put his
flame<00:01:29.869> kind<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.950> further<00:01:31.310> out<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.450> keeps

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
flame kind of further out and that keeps

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.840 
flame kind of further out and that keeps
the<00:01:32.899> zombies<00:01:33.289> from<00:01:33.590> coming<00:01:34.069> through<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the zombies from coming through the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.820 
the zombies from coming through the
tunnel<00:01:35.030> at<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.420> now<00:01:35.869> from<00:01:36.050> here<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.470> move

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
tunnel at you now from here you can move

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.190 
tunnel at you now from here you can move
even<00:01:37.130> further<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> left<00:01:38.149> it's<00:01:38.959> a<00:01:39.050> good

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
even further to the left it's a good

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.809 
even further to the left it's a good
idea<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:39.470> crouch<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:40.099> have<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.250> really<00:01:40.640> nice

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
idea to crouch you have a really nice

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.820 
idea to crouch you have a really nice
shot<00:01:41.360> at<00:01:41.569> all<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.810> zombies<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.380> pile<00:01:42.619> up
