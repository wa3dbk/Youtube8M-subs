00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.009
 Dear Colleagues, Sincerely 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.449
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.369
 our championship game against the 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.529
 tsg 1899 hope home 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.050
 the finish 0 to 0 meant for us 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.180
 the fifth draw at home and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.029
 the 24 points in this season 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.739
 I welcome the two coaches give this 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.430
 First of all, please feel free to ask our guests 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.040
 Mr. Gysi comment on the game 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 yes I think you have today clear 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 why i also think about this game 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:51.140
 warned the very difficult the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.250
 paderborner way of playing again and again 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.079
 find your own structure in the game 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.859
 a lot with long balls many fought 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.920
 and very hard there again and again 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.720
 not to go crazy 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.910
 also believe that we are the first half 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 no no nice game 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.690
 to have 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.890
 would like to speculate a bit naturally 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.929
 I say or maybe we have 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.849
 a bit too much then in the 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.580
 want to put in second half time where we 

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:25.450
 we were actually sure that if 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.530
 paderborn then a bit offensive 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.440
 we would open ours 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.179
 But getting chances was not the case 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.590
 and above all things the yellow red card 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.959
 Of course, we did not really fit in 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.520
 that's why I'm playing the cards 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.550
 happy because after that there were a few more 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.840
 really tricky situations 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.810
 Standard situations grandpa was very 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.819
 it is dangerous that we return to zero 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.709
 have played with a very good one 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.000
 goalkeeper I express today 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:58.819
 must mention olli has great parades in the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.780
 play and that's why I can 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.440
 definitely say 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.330
 30 minutes just under the point 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.200
 won 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.550
 if you look like the others 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 teams are all hard to do 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.390
 against the teams in the back 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.790
 we can today here with the point completely 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 driving well and doing well now 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.010
 to go into the country break and there 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.800
 to regain new strength then 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.190
 to initiate the final spurt in the league 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.920
 watched 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.930
 thank you very much, this is the point to be won 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 we've heard andrÃ© then the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.680
 question, we lost something today 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.900
 submit 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.790
 if I in recent weeks often the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.310
 opponent then congratulated on the victory 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.560
 I want to score today for the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 tsg congratulations because we were here 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 the better one over 90 minutes today 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.080
 team we do not just have in 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.600
 outnumber but also before that the opponent 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.280
 dominated as not only with 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.000
 long balls but also by good 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.040
 Soccer 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.450
 By the way, I also have many 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 long balls of the hoffheimer seen 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 that we are aware of, in particular 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 We are good at the defenders 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.100
 started and despite rotation we have 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.620
 today a top performance of mine 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.240
 The team saw the one super 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.340
 has shown reaction to the game of 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.800
 Last week, one hundred percent 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.950
 as a team presented aggressively 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.060
 strong in the fight and especially in the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.170
 second half still with very good 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.240
 offensive actions 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.670
 Unfortunately, we were not rewarded with one 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.960
 Tor and there can not analysis 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 give one hundred percent right 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.330
 The location would be a transition 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.300
 baumann in the gate of the hoffheimer the each 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.910
 chance has foiled and unfortunately the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.400
 deserved victory not allowed for us 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.860
 I can honestly say 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.320
 After this turbulent week, yes 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.850
 many things also happen such a 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.950
 performance of my team 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.720
 I'm not afraid of that and I'm afraid of them 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.489
 table does not look important to me anyway 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.280
 is that the performance one hundred percent 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.620
 The alignment was great 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.120
 Boys have implemented the plan perfectly 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.310
 and so we have the tsg about 90 minutes 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.080
 not a torchance allows that is 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.110
 our way and I am convinced of it 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.250
 that someday eventually the ball 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.730
 will also fidget on the net again 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.730
 Thank you
