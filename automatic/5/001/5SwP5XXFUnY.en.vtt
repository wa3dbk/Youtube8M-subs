00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
a brush but it's a lot easier to use and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
a brush but it's a lot easier to use and
it's<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> bottle<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.560> looks<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> pen

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it's not in a bottle it looks like a pen

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's not in a bottle it looks like a pen
and<00:01:10.130> before<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and before you use this you're going to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
and before you use this you're going to
want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> shake<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.770> usually<00:01:13.920> shake

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
want to shake it and I usually shake

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.070 
want to shake it and I usually shake
mine<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:15.049> 10<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.080> 20<00:01:16.530> seconds<00:01:20.570> until<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
mine for 10 or 20 seconds until you

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.109 
mine for 10 or 20 seconds until you
think<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.740> most<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> color<00:01:23.640> has<00:01:23.909> gone

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
think that most of the color has gone

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020 
think that most of the color has gone
down<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> want

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
down here and then you're going to want

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
down here and then you're going to want
to<00:01:27.119> twist<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> cap<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:34.229> looks<00:01:34.829> like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to twist the cap off and it looks like

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.660 
to twist the cap off and it looks like
this<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.549> brush<00:01:38.939> type<00:01:39.299> material

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.410 

and<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.920> part<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> top<00:01:47.550> actually<00:01:47.820> clicks

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and this part of the top actually clicks

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.780 
and this part of the top actually clicks
and<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.290> color<00:01:49.500> dispenses<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:50.490> part

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and the color dispenses out this part

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.370 
and the color dispenses out this part
and<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.760> smells<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.030> nail<00:01:54.270> polish<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and this just smells like nail polish it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
and this just smells like nail polish it
doesn't<00:01:55.650> smell<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:55.920> different<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> click

doesn't smell any different so you click
this<00:01:57.659> top<00:01:57.930> part<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.440> color<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.740> come

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this top part and the color would come

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
this top part and the color would come
out<00:01:59.010> here<00:01:59.580> as<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.240> tell<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.750> already

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
pretty purple with color since I've used

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
pretty purple with color since I've used
it<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> couple<00:02:04.050> times<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.700> you're

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it a couple times and if you're

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.609 
it a couple times and if you're
wondering<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.720> not<00:02:07.680> dried<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:09.470> not<00:02:10.470> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
wondering this is not dried out not at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.320 
wondering this is not dried out not at
all

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
all

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.960 
all
and<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.810> done<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.489> twist

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and then when you're done you just twist

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.820 
and then when you're done you just twist
it<00:02:15.120> back<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.650> like

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it back and there it is so I really like

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.979 
this pen I've been using it for a month
or<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.209> nice<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.080 
or so now I think it's really nice and
it's<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.410> easier<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.040> use<00:02:26.070> than<00:02:26.610> regular
