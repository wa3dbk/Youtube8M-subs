00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.080

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.349
 Bit about the incredible incredible 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.930
 amazing then the word in that book 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.809

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.160
 replaced in history or rather the 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.290
 story of a murderer probably 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.480
 have been in Portuguese so the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.640
 Guys have been talking to me still in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 social networks and it seems that it is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.670
 out of catalog once again people who 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.320
 feather 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.940
 Vick, let's go and have a chat. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.220
 about him as his own. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.860
 caption tells us this book goes 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.920
 tell the story of a murderer who is 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.000
 joÃ£o batista spills wii and lived in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.420
 France in the mid 18th century 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.690
 and he's a different boy because he 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.360
 had not smelled this since ever since 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.159
 that he was born and had no smell and 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.110
 people around him found him very 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 strange because of it he takes me 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.929
 gave off no smell anything 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.439
 he was abandoned by his mother and thus 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.340
 scene where the mother of lusa the sixth jamat 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.380
 It is thus one of the most disgusting things 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.319
 both the book and the film he went 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.179
 abandoned also by the milk 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.979
 one of milk a drought in the semi also with 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.869
 the time we use one of them 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.090
 even comes to return it there for a 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.590
 priest of the parish saying that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.630
 probably he is the son of the devil 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.420
 because as there is a creation a smell 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.399
 but already in the special track not only by him 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.630
 not to smell but also to feel 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.969
 that was able to identify all 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.789
 smells of the world, it's as if he 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.529
 I do not know an absolute nose and say so 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.590
 Then one day he got in touch with 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:56.749
 a producer of perfumes and will deliver 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.819
 an order at the house of this guy and there 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.969
 him in it and was impressed by 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.679
 that amount of vials do not 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.959
 essences of various flowers and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.849
 he knows that this 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.130
 perfumer daniel baldin he is 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.930
 indignant because his competitor 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.480
 Could you make a wonderful time, huh? 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.670
 which is love and psyche and when it enters 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.959
 this room full of freshly baked and such 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.420
 he asks why you want me 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.640
 make a perfume for you to get 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.590
 This is what you want and it's the end of the day. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.680
 letting him do the perfume he does and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.190
 perfume is perfect and after a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.030
 certain government insistence and baldini 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.230
 ended up accepting as an apprentice let's say 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.090
 so he is impressed 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.680
 mainly because in the place where he 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 keeps the vials there is no light that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.620
 can not have light right now because you can 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.989
 properties of some of those 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.700
 elements and such and so in the dark even 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.980
 he is picking up the right and 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.750
 goes on mixing the eye itself and the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 things are always perfect for 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.670
 a given moment in history and ends 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.950
 asking Baldin to teach him how to keep 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.170
 Smells of things right? 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.299
 he does not explain to baldini because 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940
 who is this but once during 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.060
 adolescence he follows a girl who 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.920
 had a different smell 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 he is impressed by his smell 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.660
 he wants to keep is the smell of it 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.760
 somehow ends up killing this girl 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.470
 kind of unintentionally and from that 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.989
 moment he gets kind of obsessed 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.660
 with the idea that it will produce the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.130
 perfect perfume then reaping those 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.840
 girls had to be always shows the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.519
 videos in the movie have a scene of it 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.100
 trying to do this procedure for him 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.799
 nor the smell of the person with 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.480
 A prostitute, but what are you going to do? 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.760
 this perfume it necessarily needs 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.980
 capital aroma of young girls of 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.780
 emergency them to then in the world a 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.160
 pilgrimage to find these 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.470
 perfect girls until one day he 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.500
 Find the laura, huh? 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.359
 is the most beautiful girl in the city such 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.400
 he became obsessed he needs to get the 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.549
 smell of that laura and then I will not 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.590
 to tell you anything, I did not count one 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.170
 fifth of what you have in that Gentile book 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.840
 Awesome story this author 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.840
 writes in such a phenomenal way 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.650
 the way he describes so many 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.739
 characters is the greatest villain then the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.079
 main character of the story as the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.320
 aromas even smells we would 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.750
 smell some things here 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.070
 It should be noted that France in the 18th century is a 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.349
 place in the way I think of France 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.180
 18th century reminds me of this movie I saw 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.039
 movies that when they saw me in the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.539
 film and has that other movie 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.919
 johnny depp that he is a count too 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:43.440
 call that libertine movie if you do not 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.849
 deceit to these two that always comes to the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.580
 my head when you think of the France 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.270
 18th century are films in the genres more or 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
 except not 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.340
 I ended up seeing perfume to be able to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.530
 make this video today and have only 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.139
 some disgusting scenes in my head 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.479
 I remembered how late I think it is. 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.720
 I saved the heaviest scenes in the movie. 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.150
 Even though the movie is great, it 's super. 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.889
 faithful to the book also changes here a 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.570
 here is another thing here 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.910
 the development of the history of 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.590
 characters the very end is the weather 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.020
 that the end of history is the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.090
 awesome even you need to read 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.520
 This book is a near perfect book. 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.789
 I wanted to know the book never talk ever 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.889
 will be unanimous such but if not book 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.720
 It's just the story of a murderer. 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.580
 it's just the story of a perfumer in 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.900
 search for the perfect perfume without 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.690
 so what does he do with that perfume? 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.550
 perfect that he can do at the end 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.370
 It's something like that. 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.409
 spectacular in this book is the last 50 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.960
 pages of this book are absurd 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.419
 this book is who's telling 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.610
 for you in several layers then you have 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.270
 a whole social critique behind it 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.190
 also 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.560
 Anyway, I hope I can move on to 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.669
 You at least know a brief idea. 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.130
 how sensational I found this book and 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.270
 strongly recommend that you read the 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.320
 and that 's one of those books that 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.620
 absorb the reader when you want to 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.960
 to drop means to do nothing and he super 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.789
 fast in two days is not a book as 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.120
 so he has about 250 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.099
 and this is strongly recommended that 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.719
 You read this book, too. 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.090
 to thank the staff who 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.770
