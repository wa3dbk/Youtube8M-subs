00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.399
 the well they are known as the team 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 champion of conade and what you saw 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.829
 there in the federal district louis 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.010

 for the invitation and here we are good 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 let's talk a little about this 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.019
 season 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.589
 Fabián tell us how the team is doing 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.199
 is therefore fighting there the first place or 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.350
 they are in first place with the team 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.420
 the upaep but tell us how the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.920
 team so far not because I 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.289
 I feel the team very well I think that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.909
 we have a good set we have very 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.060
 good players the reinforcements that 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.000
 the season came because they saw that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.610
 they helped us I think we have to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 repeat is not going to be easy there are many 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.470
 teams there are strong teams there 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 strong players then well neither 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.429
 it's going to be easy but then we have the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.830
 trust and I think we have like that 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.190
 unit for 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 won the championship again 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.800
 louis placical also about these 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.050
 new equipment to which they are 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.170
 facing now with this new league of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.690
 teams mostly from the north like 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.480
 as the uach as the Indians Ivan Juarez 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.550
 how much has changed in your opinion 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.940
 after playing with conade in one 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.410
 link now then putting these two together 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.460
 two major student leagues in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.220
 Mexico, I think it is 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.220
 it is something positive not for everyone because 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.230
 now of a national team no longer 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.020
 you have to have 50 60 players 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.600
 pre-selected 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.180
 and now for example all against all 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.540
 and coaches are beginning to have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.090
 players and say no then these 20 and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.790
 fast and already to have the basis that 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.340
 It's 12:15 and work more time with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.620
 with those 12 that are the ones that have to 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 go to the selection 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.590
 and well you had a good ending was last 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.349
 with which we saw the moving moving 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.580
 team you are a player that can 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.799
 revolutionize the game in any 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.690
 moment as how do you identify your game 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.620
 how would you say that is the game of Luis 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.989
 quintero 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.989
 good first of all I look for I seek to win 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.219
 in individuality there is no and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.849
 then I try to provide 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.000
 assists 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.370
 my colleagues and the points will come 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.880
 alone not at the time of leaving me alone 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.210
 with the opportunities 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.120
 you also had the support of conadeip in 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.340
 this past season 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 how do you feel now in this in this 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.220
 hour in this season still in the same 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.740
 level how do you physically feel in order 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.320
 canarian people for whom 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.850
 they come to the second part of this league b 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.570
 I feel good I feel I believe that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.490
 with a greater physique with more agility more 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.050
 speed 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.390
 the channel in vip and it was like a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.860
 responsibility or be all hit and 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.810
 they think that nothing else is me in the team and 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.030
 that I do everything on the computer and then I do not 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.770
 or whether we are five who we are twelve 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 We are there and we all do what 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.070
 we have to do if I have to pass 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.430
 I'm going to pass it true that I have to put 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.440
 to put in then I do not see how like 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.240
 that the one that stands out I do what 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.310
 I have to do for the team and if 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.800
 now I have to spend more because I 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.720
 they defend more because I'm going to do 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.490
 the arrival of eric martin has fallen well 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.320
 the team fell well since we saw it from the 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.110
 last season that you can 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.210
 practice the coach's system 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.370
 Martin with you has has very 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.490
 good system I think that what else we 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.440
 has helped his intensity he came to us 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.750
 put order the courses put in this 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.330
 label can you say I think that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.700
 helped us to gain confidence for 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.010
 take everything seriously then I think that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.350
 it helped a lot is helping us a lot 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.480
 is helping in what we lack each 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.910
 who is correcting us those mistakes 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.100
 and because he knows basketball knows a lot has 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.500
 Been elsewhere has played with the USA 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.410
 so then you know what it does 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.420
 and louis that you tell us about the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.660
 Let 's talk about the future going future 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.520
 finish your race here on the island with 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.490
 the Aztecs what would you like to do 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.150
 Then I have a year and a half left 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.530
 two means 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.530
 ending by 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.530
 in the professional 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.810
 to follow in the footsteps of your brother omar 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.810
 quintero 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.120
 Well then there he is and finally fabian 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.310
 what do you want in the future 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.350
 giving and you want to suppose to continue 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.419
 playing basketball if I want to 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.419
 dedicate myself to where the body endures 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.220
 I want to play professionalism if 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.860
 can the foreigner then that better me 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.580
 I think everyone wants to leave the country 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.199
 demonstrate what they are 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.789

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.530
 I want to go elsewhere show that in 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.199
 mexico is also played vázquez that no 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.729
 it's just football then, if there's no 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.889
 the opportunity I would like to play here 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.460
 but I think that the foreigner would be the 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.490
 first option 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.620
