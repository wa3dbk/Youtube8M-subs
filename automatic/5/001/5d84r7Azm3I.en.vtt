grow what I think you should really
concentrate<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.560> GUI<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> layout

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
and the functionality which i think is
pretty<00:01:17.189> nice<00:01:17.509> alright<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> mentioned
