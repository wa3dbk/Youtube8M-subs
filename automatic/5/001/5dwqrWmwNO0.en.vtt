00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
to mobs also the second one is is our

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
to mobs also the second one is is our
movement<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.150> when<00:00:30.269> he<00:00:30.359> moves<00:00:30.630> his<00:00:30.750> arms<00:00:30.900> he's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
movement so when he moves his arms he's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
movement so when he moves his arms he's
gonna<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.800> damage<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.309> melee<00:00:32.520> damage<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
gonna do damage like melee damage to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
gonna do damage like melee damage to
them<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> third<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> his<00:00:34.649> best<00:00:35.070> attack<00:00:35.460> which

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
them and third is his best attack which

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
them and third is his best attack which
is<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.239> where<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:36.480> fires<00:00:36.719> flaming<00:00:37.469> arrows

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
is the one where he fires flaming arrows

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
is the one where he fires flaming arrows
rapidly<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> his<00:00:38.520> mouth<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
rapidly out of his mouth like there I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
rapidly out of his mouth like there I
think<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.309> damaging<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
think and these are really damaging and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
think and these are really damaging and
it<00:00:41.850> pushes<00:00:42.030> mobs<00:00:42.270> away<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> column<00:00:42.960> you

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it pushes mobs away so the column you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
it pushes mobs away so the column you
get<00:00:43.110> anywhere<00:00:43.350> near<00:00:43.410> him<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> hit<00:00:44.010> him<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
get anywhere near him to hit him so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.770 
get anywhere near him to hit him so
that's<00:00:44.910> probably<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> disadvantage

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that's probably gonna be a disadvantage

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
that's probably gonna be a disadvantage
for<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> iron<00:00:46.980> golems<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.700> because

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
for the iron golems on that one because

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.860 
for the iron golems on that one because
they're<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.300> gonna<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.719> in

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
they're just not gonna be out to get in

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900 
they're just not gonna be out to get in
close<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> Sun<00:00:50.700> boss

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
at that one so two different rounds two

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.010

different<00:03:08.970> completely<00:03:09.540> different<00:03:09.690> um

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
different completely different um

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.970 
different completely different um
results<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.620> there<00:03:10.770> we<00:03:10.830> go

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
results so there we go

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.280 
results so there we go
so<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.820> round<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.360> UM<00:03:12.480> iron<00:03:12.780> golems<00:03:13.110> came

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.420 
actually in this case the four iron
golems<00:03:58.050> completely<00:03:58.470> owned<00:03:58.650> him<00:03:58.830> even<00:03:59.340> though

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
golems completely owned him even though

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.790 
golems completely owned him even though
the<00:03:59.550> first<00:03:59.760> battle<00:04:00.209> looked<00:04:00.480> like<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.230> Sun

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
the first battle looked like the Sun

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.530 
the first battle looked like the Sun
boss<00:04:01.980> was<00:04:02.190> clearly<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.790> better<00:04:02.940> mob<00:04:03.180> after

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
boss was clearly the better mob after

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.240 
boss was clearly the better mob after
three<00:04:04.200> battles<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.800> see<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.100> iron

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
three battles we can see that the iron

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.830 
three battles we can see that the iron
golems<00:04:05.580> did<00:04:05.730> win<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.120> overall<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.750> if

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
golems did win that one overall so if

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
golems did win that one overall so if
you<00:04:07.020> guessed<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> iron<00:04:08.370> gongs<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.850> were

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you guessed the iron gongs you were

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.770 
you guessed the iron gongs you were
correct<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.480> there<00:04:09.720> we<00:04:09.780> go

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.840
