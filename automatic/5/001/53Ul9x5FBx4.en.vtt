00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
gluten sensitivity this was the point

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
gluten sensitivity this was the point
that<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> him<00:00:49.550> although<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> show

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that really got to him although the show

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.049 
that really got to him although the show
was<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> obesity<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.280> talked<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
was on obesity we also talked about the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
was on obesity we also talked about the
fact<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.750> were<00:00:55.100> there<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> large

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
fact that there were there was a large

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.889 
fact that there were there was a large
study<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.059> 30,000<00:00:57.840> people<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.980> found<00:00:59.399> that

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
study of 30,000 people that found that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
study of 30,000 people that found that
celiac<00:01:00.899> disease<00:01:01.010> increase<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.219> risk<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
celiac disease increase your risk of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.660 
celiac disease increase your risk of
both<00:01:03.210> heart<00:01:03.660> disease<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.170> cancer<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:05.040> number

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
both heart disease and cancer are number

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.210 
both heart disease and cancer are number
one<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.119> leading<00:01:06.510> causes<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.020> death

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
one and two leading causes of death

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.180 
one and two leading causes of death
anywhere<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.369> 35<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> seventy<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:10.080> percent

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.960 

so<00:01:12.760> that<00:01:13.540> was<00:01:14.290> obviously<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.860> huge<00:01:15.220> number<00:01:15.760> and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
so that was obviously a huge number and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.720 
so that was obviously a huge number and
then<00:01:16.450> on<00:01:16.990> its<00:01:17.320> heels<00:01:17.620> was<00:01:18.010> another<00:01:18.280> study

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
then on its heels was another study

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.520 
then on its heels was another study
looking<00:01:19.450> at<00:01:19.540> our<00:01:19.690> third<00:01:19.930> leading<00:01:20.230> cause<00:01:20.350> of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
looking at our third leading cause of

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.700 
looking at our third leading cause of
death<00:01:20.950> which<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.430> autoimmune<00:01:22.120> disease<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
death which is autoimmune disease and in

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.260 
death which is autoimmune disease and in
that<00:01:23.920> study<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.520> showed<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:24.790> if<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.180> had

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
that study it showed that if you had

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.390 
that study it showed that if you had
celiac<00:01:25.660> disease<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:26.290> were<00:01:26.380> 10<00:01:26.740> times<00:01:26.770> more

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
celiac disease you were 10 times more

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.570 
celiac disease you were 10 times more
likely<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:28.030> develop<00:01:28.950> another<00:01:29.950> autoimmune

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
likely to develop another autoimmune

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.000 
likely to develop another autoimmune
disease<00:01:30.910> then<00:01:31.300> as<00:01:31.540> opposed<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.650> general

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
disease then as opposed to the general

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.550 
disease then as opposed to the general
population<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.820> did<00:01:34.030> not<00:01:34.150> have<00:01:34.420> celiac<00:01:34.840> so

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
population that did not have celiac so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.770 
population that did not have celiac so
you<00:01:35.650> took<00:01:35.890> these<00:01:36.130> two<00:01:36.700> studies<00:01:37.000> together<00:01:37.300> and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
you took these two studies together and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.270 
you took these two studies together and
you<00:01:37.870> were<00:01:37.960> really<00:01:38.260> looking<00:01:38.440> at<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.800> number

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
you were really looking at the number

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.950 
you were really looking at the number
one<00:01:39.460> number<00:01:39.610> two<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.150> number<00:01:40.180> three<00:01:40.360> leading

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
one number two and number three leading

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
one number two and number three leading
causes<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.560> death<00:01:41.680> in<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.190> country<00:01:42.900> vastly

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
causes of death in this country vastly

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.470 
causes of death in this country vastly
exacerbated<00:01:46.060> or<00:01:46.530> rose<00:01:47.730> tremendously<00:01:48.730> when

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
exacerbated or rose tremendously when

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.350 
exacerbated or rose tremendously when
someone<00:01:49.960> was<00:01:50.110> gluten<00:01:50.500> intolerant<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.360> he

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
someone was gluten intolerant and he

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.610 
someone was gluten intolerant and he
said<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.810> don't<00:01:53.320> get<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.680> why<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.730> why<00:01:55.620> in

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
said well you know there's no drug to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.610 
said well you know there's no drug to
treat<00:02:10.510> celiac<00:02:11.050> disease<00:02:11.080> or<00:02:11.590> gluten

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
treat celiac disease or gluten

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.250 
treat celiac disease or gluten
sensitivity<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.730> he<00:02:12.790> goes<00:02:12.940> oh<00:02:13.150> okay<00:02:13.600> you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
sensitivity and he goes oh okay you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.900

don't have to say any more I get it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.150 
don't have to say any more I get it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
because he understood we're a very drug

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.610 
because he understood we're a very drug
oriented<00:02:18.790> country<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.290> don't<00:02:20.470> have

that<00:02:20.739> pill<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.520> pop<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.090> feel

obviously pharmaceutical companies

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.630 
obviously pharmaceutical companies
aren't<00:02:28.450> very<00:02:28.840> interested<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.650> diagnosing

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
gluten sensitivity because they have no

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.580 
gluten sensitivity because they have no
vested<00:02:34.090> interest<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.610> worst<00:02:36.610> case<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:38.020> that

vested interest and worst case is that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.470 
vested interest and worst case is that
the<00:02:39.190> only<00:02:39.400> way<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> treat<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.300> changing

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the only way to treat it is changing

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.660 
the only way to treat it is changing
your<00:02:40.810> diet<00:02:40.989> which<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.620> lot<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.980> doctors<00:02:42.160> do<00:02:42.430> not

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
your diet which a lot of doctors do not

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.130 
your diet which a lot of doctors do not

so<00:02:46.690> poor<00:02:47.620> silly<00:02:47.950> i<00:02:48.070> can<00:02:48.340> gluten<00:02:48.640> sensitivity

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
so poor silly i can gluten sensitivity

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.720 
so poor silly i can gluten sensitivity

going to have to address it because we

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.120

one to four percent of the population it

increases with age but gluten
sensitivity<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.239> expected<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.080> affect

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the population some say as high as 30

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.910 
the population some say as high as 30
I'm<00:03:16.239> kind<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.959> camp<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.560> think<00:03:17.769> it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
I'm kind of in that camp I think it's

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.309 
I'm kind of in that camp I think it's
higher<00:03:18.130> than<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.550> think<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.480> even<00:03:19.989> if<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.200> was

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
higher than we think so even if it was

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.920 
higher than we think so even if it was
ten<00:03:20.740> percent<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.460> gluten<00:03:22.150> sensitivity<00:03:22.810> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
ten percent a gluten sensitivity and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.450 
ten percent a gluten sensitivity and
then<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.140> had<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> four<00:03:23.620> percent<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.100> celiac

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
then you had the four percent of celiac

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.010 
then you had the four percent of celiac
you're<00:03:24.970> looking<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.540> here

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
you're looking at here

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.320 
you're looking at here
huge<00:03:26.140> number<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.040> these<00:03:27.760> are<00:03:28.000> people<00:03:28.300> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
huge number and these are people that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.050 
huge number and these are people that
are<00:03:28.510> suffering<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.320> instead<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.160> finding<00:03:30.760> out

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
are suffering and instead of finding out

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.150 
are suffering and instead of finding out
that<00:03:31.270> gluten<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.930> problem<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.800> instead

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
that gluten is the problem they instead

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.700 
that gluten is the problem they instead
get<00:03:33.430> treated<00:03:34.000> for<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.720> symptoms<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.350> gluten

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
get treated for the symptoms that gluten

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.490 
get treated for the symptoms that gluten
causes<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.520> imagine<00:03:37.390> you're<00:03:38.140> gluten

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
causes so imagine you're gluten

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.170 
causes so imagine you're gluten
intolerance<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.100> causing<00:03:39.460> depression<00:03:39.610> so

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
intolerance is causing depression so

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.000 
intolerance is causing depression so
then<00:03:40.300> your<00:03:40.420> depression<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.200> treated<00:03:41.620> with<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
then your depression is treated with a

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.950 
then your depression is treated with a
drug<00:03:42.280> or<00:03:42.610> your<00:03:43.000> gluten<00:03:43.360> intolerance<00:03:43.870> is

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
drug or your gluten intolerance is

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.590 
drug or your gluten intolerance is
causing<00:03:44.380> IBS<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.190> your<00:03:45.340> IBS<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:45.880> treated<00:03:46.450> or

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
causing IBS so your IBS is treated or

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.350 
causing IBS so your IBS is treated or
your<00:03:46.750> thyroid<00:03:47.230> disease<00:03:48.030> migraines<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.270> know

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
your thyroid disease migraines you know

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.840 
your thyroid disease migraines you know
on<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.840> on<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.080> on<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.230> goes<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.430> we're<00:03:51.670> really

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
on and on and on it goes so we're really

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.000 
on and on and on it goes so we're really
missing<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.540> true<00:03:52.900> root<00:03:53.140> cause<00:03:53.410> which<00:03:53.830> is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
missing the true root cause which is

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.300
