00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.339
 therefore also the idea beh 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.820
 m for every get met that did that municipalities standard idea 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.589
 you are 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.179
 researcher for example 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.739
 and j I think 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.999
 and that the missions are the measure behind each other you go all that thought 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.900
 and then you still start with 13 14 steps 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 then 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.829
 plus a sign to the eemland region I have it now and now I have taken a step 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.470
 so that actually doesn't work 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 vim and what is the effect is that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.070
 the moment you go back after a dream state 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 so to the top class 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.320
 sitting 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.140
 justice you know god 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 on the water side 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 that you then suddenly so there is calculated moment and so that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 The flandriens then let you experience it 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.930
 and those moments 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.300
 the writer at least the people who have written on it as 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.170
 a kind of divine spark a kind of grace 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 I have a unique I now 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 what i see is that you 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 that you have to live a lot of preliminary work 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.500
 he got that effort or the broadcast effort, or the whole thing 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.760
 emotional effort 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 everything from your system 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310
 it has to resist there 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 to receive it 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.790
 with it 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.170
 and that on that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.500
 unguarded moments 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 I'm just saying the receipt 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.390
 state you have to say so 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 like it and pick up a signal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.149
 you get a raid 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.260
 it is of course possible the raid 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.300
 it falls in 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.290
 it is it is from 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.420
 our or 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.640
 from the time spirit says skills reception 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 because then you had worked out 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.980
 to receive 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 all your soul and bliss in the face 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.919
 so i can i can the thought i would the thought 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 daring 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.919
 evolution of society the development of 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.689
 our society 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 that it is supported by 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.099
 occasionally ride a horse 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.349
 in the form of 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.349
 people out there receive the prize 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.049
 for the presence of management intelligence 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.449
 I wouldn't 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 I would not easily call it god 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
 because that's that try myself busy with it 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.329
 government quickly the association with human-like beings with a beard, etc. 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.689
 but 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.179
 sure if not 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:02.559
 there are two forces 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.019
 3 who have played that role 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.649
 coincidence there is nobody 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.059
 so hard to rain the pub that the army is between lines 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.099
 for nobody 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.899
 so a then customer determines how it went 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.899
 it's a good solution 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.459
 And now they have to be responsible for it 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.820
 it's true for me 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.820
 be the explanation with the kidneys that science provides 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.279
 development of lying origin of the culture everything hurt motion 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.639
 beethoven mop 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.729
 Yes that is 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.789
 totally inadequate they actually border the clinic on a nice one 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.669
 the plan but the other side of the bus should be able to choose it is proven and 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.179
 with that 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.179
 that recognized aldermen is behind intelligence 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.809
 of course no longer such a destination for me can me in my 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.119
 feeling is true 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.119
 so the sense evidence 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.859
 I want to sing here about the beauty of creation 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.839
 I do not mean that at all in the sense of the week is of course very common 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:11.259
 me 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.200
 it is so much beautiful 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.479
 nature i just want beautiful 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.180
 and composes so insane 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.989
 to make something we have to transfer it to sera and then smother it 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.789
 light flames 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.789
 sparks jump that great idea 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.490
 all spots together with everything and expresses each other 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.180
 for example the smallest 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.229
 associated with the greatest 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.770
 and for example I have the content preview and the shell corner preview 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.129
 it's just shell 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.319
 but the shape of the shell the composition of the shell the lawfulness contained in it 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.729
 sit is the same 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.490
 as those of and each set-up tracks at millions of light-years away from the 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.219
 huge size 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.320
 the set very large outside and the very small 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.550
 close to 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.650
 that anyway that has a form about income or one 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.259
 a good agreement on a composition agreements structures agreement 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 what is it? 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.749
 the turn the connecting pattern 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.749
 between the fact that I have one 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.740
 but a starfish 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.599
 and this speech said heagen 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.770
 and a rose 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.349
 a flower is with 5 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.550
 the coming 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.520
 why this number 5 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.020
 in those three life forms that they connect the patron so it 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.509
 2 all-pervasive 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.169
 networks of 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.169
 similarities 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.059
 I find this incredibly fascinating 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.159
 that ratio of the golden ratio 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.479
 who by wind never discovered Italian fibonacci, so to speak 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.619
 and described that is 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.779
 30 10 is the art 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.849
 Of course your own body has all those increases 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.159
 that is wonderfully nourishing 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.619
 I had a new win this is only especially noticeable 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.360
 we have something to celebrate this 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.849
 well it is good to be at it 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.639
 and nature has come out this is a hammond 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.490
 there is beautiful in the future 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.029
 it makes me a euro moped rider 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.960
 at least also a personal contribution thereto 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.979
 that's me 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.360
 camp can help 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.499
 that is in sight 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:34.939
 everything popping couples 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.180
 connection in the world 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.439
 a how 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.629
 who are going in creatively aware 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.369
 in the world 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.559
 in creation say in nature 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:49.829
 if i can contribute to that if i don't believe i found a little bit 

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:51.129
 can get over it 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.280
 then that is a role 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.940
 and therefore less because of course that does not permeate more say 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.310
 that realization
