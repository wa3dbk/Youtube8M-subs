00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
corners and we didn't get it past the

corners and we didn't get it past the
first<00:00:47.910> man<00:00:48.210> literally<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.079> were<00:00:49.200> getting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
first man literally when we were getting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.310 
first man literally when we were getting
a<00:00:49.469> corner<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:51.020> conceding<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.289> goal

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a corner it was like conceding a goal

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.549 
a corner it was like conceding a goal
because<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.820> were<00:00:54.149> doing<00:00:54.360> nothing<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.899> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
because we were doing nothing with it we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
because we were doing nothing with it we
I'd<00:00:55.739> rather<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> goal<00:00:56.399> kick<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I'd rather have a goal kick than a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
I'd rather have a goal kick than a
corner<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.079> shared<00:00:58.440> corners<00:00:58.829> we've<00:00:59.190> got<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> be

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
corner we shared corners we've got to be

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520 
corner we shared corners we've got to be
one<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> most<00:00:59.910> ineffective<00:01:00.420> teams<00:01:01.050> at

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
one of the most ineffective teams at

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
one of the most ineffective teams at
corner<00:01:02.039> kicks<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> Premier<00:01:02.789> League<00:01:02.820> yeah

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
corner kicks in the Premier League yeah

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
corner kicks in the Premier League yeah
we<00:01:03.570> mustn't<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.530> mustn't<00:01:04.710> practice<00:01:05.250> Garner's

well I think the last goal we scored

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.289 
well I think the last goal we scored
from<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.799> corner<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:08.220> Martin<00:01:08.549> Demichelis<00:01:08.670> at
