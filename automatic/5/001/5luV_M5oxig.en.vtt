 filled with sweets what we need 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.879
 it's decorative paper and the only thing 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.199
 accusations that we're going to throw candy 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 chocolate cookies what you 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.000
 want to keep inside the box 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 run with the decorative paper only that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 It suggests that if they have a lid that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.470
 one thing they collect it from a color of this 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.089
 type of paper and the cap players what 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.330
 type of paper for example we routed 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.130
 save the covers is the paper type 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 inside you can put a doll which 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.850
 be and well that we do not always 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780
 grab some artistic and we're going to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.719
 to write 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.570
 to do it with the family each box goes 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:26.909
 to have something important to do 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.270

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.829
 let's write on the piece of paper 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 exactly what I like is also 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.880
 give them a fragility because to do 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.670
 this mission wonders that hugs 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.579
 completely healthy choose this 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.739
 solar industry will already be good 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.630
