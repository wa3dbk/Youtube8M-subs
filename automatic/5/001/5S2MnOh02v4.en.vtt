00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.290
 ok just a couple of minutes ago I passed 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 was a squirrel year and I liked the game 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.309
 from and design to them almost nothing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 only what they used to do is known 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.420
 flash games and slowly mastered 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.609
 English language list of flash games they have 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.949
 pretty decent food from platformers 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.500
 quests with torture even have 2d action 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 where do you play for 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 Raina Gosling is also among them. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 original gods will be very where in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 the basis is taken of the survival mission it is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.020
 there is also in the full version 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
 the guys saw how the original was 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 successful that they decided to make the whole game 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.870
 with google india crowdfunding 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 having collected enough money guys 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 contacted devolver digital and thereby 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 plus sword or siberia green light itself 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 the game is of 1 click 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 a thriller that is cruel but sometimes very 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.039
 even cruel in this game the choice has 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 value hello tale 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.420
 but it will not affect the ending , which is insulting 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.949
 but unlike games tale and choice 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.570
 it's quite interesting here and you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.730
 can experiment situations 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 try to go through and chapter perfect though 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.010
 it takes very, very much 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.810
 try the game just incredible 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.549
 hard I managed to play paradise not 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 beat where there were only two levels 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 difficulties are now 5 and you will 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.820
 constantly fail 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.860
 but defeat in this whole sense and yes it is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.450
 one of those same games 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.909
 but if you want to fully enjoy 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 play the original game because 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.180
 break your mouse buy a new one then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 already try the easiest difficulty 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 the atmosphere keeps the soundtrack which 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 stunning you can get it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.500
 together with the game about the plot I will tell 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.600
 a little his rest you should learn 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 we ourselves play for Sergeant Burton 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.290
 who has to make a lot of decisions 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.060
 oh gods will follow him for me 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.770
 Personally, the game reminded such text 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.659
 quests in space rangers you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 should monitor the situation 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 predict the future course of events and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.939
 making sometimes difficult decisions is also not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 forget to write down the necessary data 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.450
 yourself on a piece of paper but it also happens that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.579
 data may change as 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.990
 over-passing which adds interest 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.000
 in fact, after each defeat 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.970
 turned off this game and just sat and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.710
 sulked how difficult it is 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 but then a couple of minutes later I wanted to again 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.580
 turn on and and try again one more time 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.580
 once again once again once more
