figures<00:00:05.839> because<00:00:06.839> certainly<00:00:08.240> many<00:00:09.240> Israelis

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
figures because certainly many Israelis

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.870 
figures because certainly many Israelis
perhaps<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.260> believed<00:00:10.530> by<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.040> they<00:00:11.639> would

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
perhaps are believed by now they would

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.339 
perhaps are believed by now they would
be<00:00:11.910> safer<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.660> rocket<00:00:12.929> attacks<00:00:13.230> should

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
be safer that the rocket attacks should

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
be safer that the rocket attacks should
have<00:00:13.469> been<00:00:13.590> contained<00:00:14.099> curtailed

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
have been contained curtailed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.450 
have been contained curtailed
I<00:00:15.030> heard<00:00:15.870> Olmert<00:00:16.260> said<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> Hezbollah

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I heard Olmert said that the Hezbollah

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540 
I heard Olmert said that the Hezbollah
infrastructure<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.960> being<00:00:19.550> dismantled

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
infrastructure was being dismantled

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.000 
infrastructure was being dismantled
clearly<00:00:21.390> though<00:00:21.539> they've<00:00:21.689> still<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
clearly though they've still got a very

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
clearly though they've still got a very
effective<00:00:23.369> military<00:00:23.789> capability<00:00:24.390> that's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
effective military capability that's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.810 
effective military capability that's
true<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.279> makes<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
true and I think that makes the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
true and I think that makes the
objective<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.920> removing<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> threat

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
objective of removing the threat

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.479 
objective of removing the threat
destroying<00:00:30.119> their<00:00:30.359> capability<00:00:31.489> eliminating

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
destroying their capability eliminating

imperative<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> fact<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

to say a disproportionate response

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
to say a disproportionate response
because<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.340> I'd<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.520> criticizing<00:01:39.119> Britain

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because then I'd be criticizing Britain

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
because then I'd be criticizing Britain

Churchill's<00:01:52.200> government<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
Churchill's government for doing that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.390 
Churchill's government for doing that
because<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:55.079> fact<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.590> time<00:01:55.860> of
