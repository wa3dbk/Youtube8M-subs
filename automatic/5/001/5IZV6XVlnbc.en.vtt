00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
comparison to the Christopher Nolan

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.190

well<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:10.160> big<00:02:10.340> issue<00:02:10.520> there<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.090> that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
well I think the big issue there is that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
in the air that he was going for was the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.180 
in the air that he was going for was the
bob<00:02:19.730> kane<00:02:20.120> era<00:02:20.450> Batman<00:02:20.990> or<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:21.770> batman

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
bob kane era Batman or in which batman

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
bob kane era Batman or in which batman
it<00:02:22.730> kill<00:02:23.150> for<00:02:23.540> one<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.280> mr.<00:02:25.280> Gordon<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.820> like

it kill for one and mr. Gordon was like
a<00:02:26.780> baby<00:02:27.530> guy<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.060> think<00:02:29.630> that's<00:02:29.900> one<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.290> the

a baby guy so I think that's one of the
big<00:02:30.680> things<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.160> lot<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.340> people<00:02:31.400> overlook

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
another debate but I'm just saying I

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.800 
another debate but I'm just saying I
can't<00:04:00.080> imagine<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.650> man-bat<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.520> that<00:04:01.700> world<00:04:01.940> I

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
can't imagine a man-bat in that world I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.940 
can't imagine a man-bat in that world I
felt<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:05.480> Scarecrow<00:04:06.050> wasn't<00:04:06.560> as

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
felt that the Scarecrow wasn't as

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.580 
felt that the Scarecrow wasn't as
horrific<00:04:07.310> as<00:04:07.760> he<00:04:08.030> should<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.269> been<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.690> I

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
horrific as he should have been I I

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.870 
horrific as he should have been I I
think<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.100> can<00:04:10.190> go<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> lot<00:04:10.489> further<00:04:10.730> with

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
think you can go a lot further with

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.910 
think you can go a lot further with
those<00:04:11.180> characters<00:04:11.690> then<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.560> has<00:04:12.739> been

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
those characters then that has been

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.699 
those characters then that has been
given<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.250> us<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.760> unfortunately<00:04:14.720> no<00:04:15.380> one<00:04:15.560> has

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
given to us and unfortunately no one has

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:16.729 
given to us and unfortunately no one has
closed<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.310> door

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
closed that door

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.069 
closed that door
and<00:04:16.979> we<00:04:17.609> will<00:04:17.789> never<00:04:17.940> see<00:04:18.359> these<00:04:18.660> characters

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
and we will never see these characters

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.360 
and we will never see these characters
tria<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.380> way<00:04:19.500> we<00:04:19.620> would<00:04:19.739> love<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.099> see<00:04:20.250> them

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
tria the way we would love to see them

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.620 
tria the way we would love to see them
treated<00:04:20.669> yeah<00:04:21.090> that's<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.329> problem<00:04:21.539> because

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
treated yeah that's a problem because

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.999 
treated yeah that's a problem because
it's<00:04:21.930> become<00:04:22.199> so<00:04:22.410> wildly<00:04:22.770> successful

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
it's become so wildly successful

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.969 
it's become so wildly successful
christopher<00:04:23.910> nolan's<00:04:24.210> take<00:04:24.680> there's<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.770> great

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
christopher nolan's take there's a great

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.920 
christopher nolan's take there's a great
deal<00:04:26.130> over<00:04:26.250> yo<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.699> ties<00:04:27.240> into<00:04:27.449> why<00:04:27.630> people

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
deal over yo and it ties into why people

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.480 
deal over yo and it ties into why people
don't<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.349> timbers<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.710> films<00:04:29.130> all<00:04:29.280> of

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
don't like the timbers and films all of

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.430 
don't like the timbers and films all of
a<00:04:29.550> sudden<00:04:29.880> he<00:04:30.270> went<00:04:30.479> if<00:04:30.840> they<00:04:30.990> loved<00:04:31.229> them

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
a sudden he went if they loved them

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.839 
a sudden he went if they loved them
before<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> Christian<00:04:32.069> or<00:04:32.190> movies<00:04:32.490> company

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
before the Christian or movies company

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.089 
before the Christian or movies company
came<00:04:33.000> out<00:04:33.180> it's<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:34.199> because<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.830> Nolan

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
came out it's not because the Nolan

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.760 
came out it's not because the Nolan
movies<00:04:35.370> are<00:04:35.520> better<00:04:35.990> yeah<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> must<00:04:37.620> stress

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
movies are better yeah I must stress

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.740 
movies are better yeah I must stress
this<00:04:38.130> they're<00:04:38.759> they're<00:04:39.360> certainly<00:04:39.690> not

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
this they're they're certainly not

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.080 
this they're they're certainly not
better<00:04:40.139> written<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.889> terms<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.639> how<00:04:42.060> they

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
better written in terms of how they

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.999 
better written in terms of how they
present<00:04:42.330> their<00:04:42.630> dialogue<00:04:42.990> because<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.770> films

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
present their dialogue because the films

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.040 
present their dialogue because the films
are<00:04:44.130> needlessly<00:04:44.430> wordy<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.030> they<00:04:45.270> there's

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
are needlessly wordy and they there's

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.450 
are needlessly wordy and they there's
nothing<00:04:46.410> left<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.680> imagination<00:04:46.770> there's

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
nothing left to the imagination there's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.689 
nothing left to the imagination there's
no<00:04:47.699> there's<00:04:48.539> no<00:04:48.690> way<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.930> analyze<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.130> film

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
no there's no way to analyze the film

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.260 
no there's no way to analyze the film
analyzes<00:04:51.150> itself<00:04:51.599> but<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:52.620> aside<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:54.180> know

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
analyzes itself but that aside you know

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.010 
analyzes itself but that aside you know
it's<00:04:54.479> really<00:04:55.340> undercutting<00:04:56.599> Batman<00:04:57.599> legacy

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
it's really undercutting Batman legacy

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.170 
it's really undercutting Batman legacy
as<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.169> whole<00:04:58.349> when<00:04:58.590> people<00:04:59.069> prefer<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.909> and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
as a whole when people prefer that and

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.210 
as a whole when people prefer that and
it's<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.840> wildly<00:05:01.169> successful<00:05:01.409> because<00:05:01.889> it's

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
it's so wildly successful because it's

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.730 
it's so wildly successful because it's
realistic<00:05:02.490> it's<00:05:02.880> like<00:05:03.090> people<00:05:03.659> can't<00:05:04.470> enjoy
