00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
long the delay was it seemed like it let

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
went through the garage door it really

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.340 
went through the garage door it really
felt<00:06:04.190> like<00:06:04.340> it<00:06:04.550> was<00:06:04.670> something<00:06:04.880> like<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:06.320> know

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
felt like it was something like you know

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.350 
felt like it was something like you know
five<00:06:06.980> second<00:06:07.430> slider<00:06:07.610> which<00:06:07.760> is<00:06:07.880> way<00:06:08.030> too<00:06:08.090> long

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
five second slider which is way too long

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.820 
five second slider which is way too long
when<00:06:08.540> you<00:06:08.630> imagine<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:08.960> car<00:06:09.230> full<00:06:09.470> throttle

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
when you imagine that car full throttle

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.230 
when you imagine that car full throttle
but<00:06:09.920> it<00:06:10.040> felt<00:06:10.250> like<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.400> almost<00:06:10.640> five<00:06:10.910> seconds

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
but it felt like I almost five seconds

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.350 
but it felt like I almost five seconds
later<00:06:11.330> before<00:06:11.510> you<00:06:11.660> hear<00:06:11.780> them<00:06:13.090> there's<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.210> car

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
later before you hear them there's a car

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.000 
later before you hear them there's a car
