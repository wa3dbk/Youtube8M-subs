00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.620 
if he'd been revived by Shenron he
couldn't<00:03:21.040> come<00:03:21.250> back<00:03:21.400> again<00:03:21.910> because<00:03:22.090> channel

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
couldn't come back again because channel

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.780 
couldn't come back again because channel
is<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.840> had<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.200> power<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.340> that's<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
is not had that power so that's the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.220 
is not had that power so that's the
biggest<00:03:24.970> proof<00:03:25.209> right<00:03:25.330> there<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.540> Goku<00:03:26.050> did

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
biggest proof right there that Goku did

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.470 
biggest proof right there that Goku did
not<00:03:26.350> die<00:03:26.560> against<00:03:27.190> Frieza<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.330> guys

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
right there and that's why Goku did not

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.650 
right there and that's why Goku did not

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
died then I would've been convinced that

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.030 
died then I would've been convinced that

cannot ignore that fact and because that
I<00:04:46.550> was<00:04:46.670> convinced<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.180> group<00:04:47.420> who<00:04:47.510> couldn't

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
I was convinced that group who couldn't

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.270 
I was convinced that group who couldn't
die<00:04:47.960> because<00:04:48.260> Shenron<00:04:48.770> can't<00:04:48.980> bring<00:04:49.130> him<00:04:49.250> back

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
die because Shenron can't bring him back

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860 
die because Shenron can't bring him back
more<00:04:49.640> than<00:04:49.760> once<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.270> makes<00:04:50.420> so<00:04:50.660> much<00:04:50.840> sense

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
more than once it makes so much sense

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.260 
more than once it makes so much sense
that<00:04:51.500> both<00:04:51.740> anime<00:04:52.250> manga<00:04:52.460> once<00:04:52.910> when<00:04:53.030> Google

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
that both anime manga once when Google

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.270 
that both anime manga once when Google
found<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.540> lava<00:04:53.810> Shan<00:04:54.680> once<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.130> wish

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
found the lava Shan once that you wish

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.710 
found the lava Shan once that you wish
been<00:04:55.460> granted<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.940> bring<00:04:56.090> back<00:04:56.240> everyone<00:04:56.570> and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
been granted to bring back everyone and

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.400 
been granted to bring back everyone and
then<00:04:56.810> we<00:04:56.960> see<00:04:57.110> Goku<00:04:57.500> emerging<00:04:58.040> out<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.370> fire

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
then we see Goku emerging out the fire

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.240 
then we see Goku emerging out the fire
another<00:05:00.410> thing<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.770> made<00:05:00.890> all<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.130> guys

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
another thing that made all you guys

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.520 
another thing that made all you guys
blind<00:05:01.670> about<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.780> fact<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.080> couple<00:05:03.350> died

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
blind about the fact that couple died

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.350 
blind about the fact that couple died
was<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.770> fact<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.280> Gohan<00:05:04.820> said<00:05:05.000> he<00:05:05.120> couldn't

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
was the fact that Gohan said he couldn't

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.330 
was the fact that Gohan said he couldn't
sense<00:05:05.510> Goku's<00:05:05.840> energy<00:05:06.350> but<00:05:06.650> guys<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.160> was

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
sense Goku's energy but guys that was

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.790 
sense Goku's energy but guys that was
filler<00:05:07.730> so<00:05:08.270> that<00:05:08.390> never<00:05:08.540> happened<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.350> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
filler so that never happened and the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.380 
filler so that never happened and the
reason<00:05:09.830> why<00:05:10.070> freeze<00:05:10.490> out<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:10.880> book<00:05:11.060> who<00:05:11.180> died

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
reason why freeze out that book who died

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.720 
reason why freeze out that book who died
was<00:05:11.600> because<00:05:11.870> remember<00:05:12.500> Frieza<00:05:13.070> can't<00:05:13.460> sense

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
was because remember Frieza can't sense

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.420 
was because remember Frieza can't sense
Goku's<00:05:14.150> energy<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:14.900> Frieza<00:05:15.530> had<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.800> power<00:05:16.220> to

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
Goku's energy if Frieza had a power to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.490 
Goku's energy if Frieza had a power to
sense<00:05:16.850> Goku's<00:05:17.180> energy<00:05:17.600> he<00:05:18.200> would<00:05:18.410> have

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
sense Goku's energy he would have

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.960 
sense Goku's energy he would have
realized<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.890> go<00:05:19.010> who's<00:05:19.160> not<00:05:19.280> dead<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.700> Goku

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
realized I go who's not dead and I Goku

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.510 
realized I go who's not dead and I Goku
sit<00:05:20.150> on<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.330> lava<00:05:20.830> ever<00:05:21.830> thought<00:05:22.040> about<00:05:22.160> that

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
sit on the lava ever thought about that

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.490 
sit on the lava ever thought about that
that<00:05:22.910> woulda<00:05:23.120> been<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.300> possibility<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.440> you

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
that woulda been a possibility so you

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.380 
that woulda been a possibility so you
can't<00:05:24.770> know<00:05:24.980> these<00:05:25.220> facts<00:05:25.730> right<00:05:25.910> here<00:05:26.210> and

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
that's the thing I've got me convinced

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.770 
that's the thing I've got me convinced
that<00:05:27.950> Goku<00:05:28.370> didn't<00:05:28.640> die<00:05:28.790> against<00:05:29.330> Frieza

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
that Goku didn't die against Frieza
