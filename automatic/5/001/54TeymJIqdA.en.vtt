I think he was overlooked a little bit

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
I think he was overlooked a little bit
because<00:00:47.280> he<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> non<00:00:48.000> rare<00:00:48.300> card<00:00:48.660> however

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
because he was a non rare card however

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.750 
because he was a non rare card however
if<00:00:49.440> he's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> rare<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.370> he's<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
if he's a rare this time he's going to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
75 shooting aren't half bad so I can see

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
75 shooting aren't half bad so I can see
him<00:01:38.460> being<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:39.090> popular<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.750> FIFA<00:01:40.140> 13

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
him being really popular in FIFA 13

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
him being really popular in FIFA 13
because<00:01:41.009> he<00:01:41.159> sort<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> stats<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
because he sort of has all the stats you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
because he sort of has all the stats you
really<00:01:42.630> need<00:01:42.869> from<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> sentra<00:01:43.470> attacking<00:01:43.799> mid

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
really need from a sentra attacking mid

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
really need from a sentra attacking mid
and<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.759> those<00:01:45.060> were<00:01:45.270> five<00:01:45.540> players<00:01:45.899> who<00:01:46.110> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and so those were five players who I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
and so those were five players who I
think<00:01:46.259> might<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.009> buy<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> beginning

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
think might be good to buy the beginning

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
think might be good to buy the beginning
