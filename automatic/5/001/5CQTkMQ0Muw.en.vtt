00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello teacher my name is paula 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 castaÃ±eda and the theme to develop is the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.680
 Global positioning system more 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.470
 known as gps 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.510
 what is a gps is a global system of 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.430
 satellite navigation allows 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.619
 determine with great precision the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 position of an object anywhere 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the world geography 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 gps is a device that as we all know 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.920
 It serves to take us from one place to another 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.020
 of the world but for the gps to work 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 and guide us where we want to go are 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.000
 necessary three systems the system 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 global positioning satellite the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 navigation system is and finally 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.050
 the maps of our country 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.780
 we go in parts the gps achieves its 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.610
 position through your receiver this 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.010
 must pick up the signal of at least four 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.200
 satellites to fix a position to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.120
 from the time it takes for the signal to 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.340
 each satellite to be received by 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.190
 triangulation in this way it 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.150
 will establish our location this 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.520
 position 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.770
 it was in degrees terrestrial coordinates 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.960
 of longitude and latitude and how this is 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.820
 unintelligible to the naked eye 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.210
 we need maps to establish 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.970
 graphically our location the maps 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.130
 loaded in our gps show us 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.899
 those coordinates as a point for 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.270
 be able to quickly visualize where 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.850
 we are as we move this 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.619
 longitude and latitude vary and that 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 variation makes the point on the map 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.409
 change position 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.359
 but so that the gps reaches us where 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.280
 we want a system of 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.600
 navigation when between we are the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 direction of our destination 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.920
 the system translates its location into the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.289
 map coordinates and after a route 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 considering the disposition and sense of 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.429
 the streets from there the system 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.159
 will guide us through graphic signs in 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.189
 screen and also if you want will give us 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.560
 the voice commands each gps has its 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.450
 own map reading system and not 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.630
 there are maps of all the countries of the world 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 for all gps brands verify 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 the availability of maps before 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.289
 buy the gps according to the quality of the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.049
 equipment the gps can have a precision 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.299
 of 3 meters and although many still not 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.620
 know how the use of satellites is 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.989
 gratuitous 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 besides the traditional gps we can 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.540
 find the differential gps which 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.870
 introduces greater accuracy in the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.819
 system this type of receiver in addition to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.910
 receive and process the information of the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.870
 satellites receives and processes 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.000
 simultaneously other information 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.069
 additional from a station 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.590
 land 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.780
 in a place nearby and recognized by the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.629
 receiver is the second information 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.639
 allows to correct the inaccuracies that 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.829
 can be entered into the signals that 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.499
 the receiver receives from the satellites in 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.420
 this case the ground station 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.310
 transmits the settings to the gps receiver 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.099
 that are necessary to perform in all 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.260
 this moment contrasts them with their own 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.389
 information and make the corrections 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.969
 showing on your screen the data 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.469
 very accurately correct the 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.989
 Surveyors use this tool 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.450
 to determine benchmarks 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.120
 geographic features or infrastructure 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.489
 among others what allows to have 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 precise topographic information without 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.739
 errors and easily updated 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.720
 there are different sources of error of the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.269
 gps signal name of the three that to me 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.670
 judgment deems the most important 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.010
 first is traces I will not be and 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.319
 troposphere in which the signal of the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.019
 GPS satellite becomes slow while 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.420
 the gps system goes through the atmosphere 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.700
 therefore uses a calculator 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.400
 internal to measure an average error of 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.130
 delay to partially correct this 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.349
 type of error the second is signals 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.840
 multiple this occurs when the signal 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.900
 gps is reflected by objects such as 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.819
 buildings or rocky surfaces before 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.590
 get to the gps receiver which 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.079
 increases the travel time of the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.349
 finally causing an error 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.260
 we found the error of the clock 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.750
 gps receiver the internal clocks of the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.239
 gps sector is not as accurate as the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.250
 atomic clock that carries the satellites 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.329
 gps on board so it can be produced 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.329
 a small mistake 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.190
 the applications most used by 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.260
 gps users are the following 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.800
 positioning which will determine a 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.690
 position or location navigation given 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.880
 that we can calculate positions in 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.430
 any time and repeated clutch 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.370
 known two points we can determine 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.540
 a tour and determine the best route 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.580
 among them two topography thanks to the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.830
 accuracy of the surveyors system 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.840
 they have a very useful tool 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.330
 for the determination of points of 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.060
 reference geographic features or 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.820
 infrastructures among others 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.430
 synchronization given the characteristic 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.680
 additional measurement of the time that 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.540
 expose the gps receivers we can 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.930
 use this system to determine 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.900
 moments in which they happen or will happen 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.880
 certain events and finally the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.770
 monitoring that is achieved through 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.040
 gps adaptation to systems 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.260
 communication a vehicle or person can 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.889
 communicate your position to a central 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.889
 tracing 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.169
 thank you very much for your relationship
