00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi to all this is my first 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.170
 podcasts in this period the energies 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.179
 are aimed at a much more project 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 more important than the usual videos 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.940
 which I realize and publish on this channel 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 a project that I hope will come to light in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.850
 non-biblical times and I hope you will follow 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 and you will support I was lucky enough to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.529
 meet the right people for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.660
 undertake this ambitious adventure 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 sensitive people artists men who 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 they want to project themselves into a future 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.320
 better and want to serve 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 of this will 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 for now I can't tell you anything else in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 meanwhile with little time left to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.629
 disposition I can no longer dedicate myself 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 to the realization of my classics 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.390
 video so I chose to use this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 format if you give me the term 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 television a slimmer format similar to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.590
 a podcast 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.109
 in a nutshell you will only hear my voice 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 without too elaborate texts without 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.840
 image editing will also 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 happen that the audio quality will be more 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 poor if I had to record my voice 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 quickly and with luck 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 I do this for myself because I don't 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 I can not say what I think e 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 I will continue to do so through this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 channel 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.549
 but I also do a little for sense of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.799
 owed to those people who me 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 follow and have shown me how much 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.020
 it can be important too 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.750
 someone's opinion is often said 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 that the world changes with non actions 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.119
 with opinions I am not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 totally agree 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.150
 It is obvious that if no action comes 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 accomplished 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.659
 no change can really happen 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 never in any context but it is also true the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.170
 contrary to that is that no action 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.320
 once for change it will never come to light 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.259
 without a change of opinion before though 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.500
 with opinion we mean opinions and meaning 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.640
 side that is how we evaluate and there 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.329
 we relate to what we have 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.649
 around 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.959
 for this reason we must never underestimate 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.120
 the power of words and thought 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.430
 the opinion of others must serve to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.849
 to question ourselves when 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.530
 we discuss true dialogue with others 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.590
 it must happen within us 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.269
 between us and our thoughts stimulated by 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.220
 those of others 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.200
 you know well that I try not to 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 never utter my words with 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.290
 the intention to convince convincing is 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.970
 an attitude that involves antagonism 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.700
 antagonism also removes listening 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.680
 we therefore use words and thought 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.930
 not as a weapon 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.569
 let's use them as we will use seeds from 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.030
 throw on a field will be the seeds that 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.819
 will decide if it's the right time for 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.879
 emerge and generate the fruits that belong to them 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.489
 time they will generate other seeds as if 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.470
 we were in a forest we wanted e 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.989
 we wanted to take out the weeds that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.299
 they grow we can try to cut away 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.709
 the grass to make it disappear by hoping that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.480
 don't grow 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.480
 or we could try to plant some 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.239
 new trees higher than overhanging 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160
 this weeds and make them suffocate 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.799
 without letting him get a bit of 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.449
 sun perhaps would be a more method 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.609
 intelligent and more definitive well with 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.940
 this I conclude with the hope that 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.329
 this will be the beginning of something 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.129
 new not just a new way at the end 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.620
 to address to those who listen to me and in 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.919
 waiting for a much bigger project a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.919
 hug
