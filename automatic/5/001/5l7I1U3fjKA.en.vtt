along garden box I'm going to run
through<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.520> real<00:03:10.760> quick<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:12.590> how<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.800> does

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.930 

hold<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.880> button<00:03:20.180> down<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:22.430> pull<00:03:22.730> this

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
hold the button down and you pull this

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.880 
hold the button down and you pull this
handle<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.630> get<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.410> started

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
handle to get it started

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:34.940 
handle to get it started
which<00:03:25.070> I'm<00:03:25.220> not

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.360 

hold<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.610> handle<00:03:35.880> down<00:03:36.140> engine

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
hold the handle down engine

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.510 
hold the handle down engine
the<00:03:38.760> motor<00:03:39.030> spins<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.470> then<00:03:40.830> spins<00:03:41.280> back

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
the motor spins up and then spins back

00:03:41.520 --> 00:04:22.920 
the motor spins up and then spins back
down<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.060> has<00:03:42.180> no<00:03:42.360> resistance

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.630 

so<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.380> does<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> pretty<00:04:24.770> good<00:04:25.010> job<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.490> that

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
so it does a pretty good job on that

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.390 
so it does a pretty good job on that
really<00:04:25.820> tall<00:04:26.150> nasty<00:04:26.960> grass<00:04:27.280> obviously<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.310> got

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
really tall nasty grass obviously I got

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.270 
really tall nasty grass obviously I got
to<00:04:28.550> come<00:04:28.670> by<00:04:28.820> with<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> weed<00:04:29.270> whacker<00:04:29.570> and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
to come by with the weed whacker and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.850 
to come by with the weed whacker and
knock<00:04:31.280> some<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.700> stuff<00:04:32.000> down<00:04:32.860> we're

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
knock some of that stuff down we're

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.680 
knock some of that stuff down we're
typically<00:04:34.160> getting<00:04:34.400> about<00:04:34.700> an<00:04:34.820> hour<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.390> run

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
typically getting about an hour of run

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.050 
typically getting about an hour of run
time<00:04:35.990> maybe<00:04:36.410> an<00:04:36.620> hour<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.040> 15<00:04:37.430> minutes<00:04:37.730> of<00:04:37.850> run

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060

time<00:04:38.300> out<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.260> two<00:04:39.440> batteries<00:04:39.920> it<00:04:40.460> really

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
time out of the two batteries it really

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.130 
time out of the two batteries it really
seems<00:04:41.030> like<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.420> take<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.630> lot<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:41.900> breaks

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
seems like if you take a lot of breaks

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140 
seems like if you take a lot of breaks
and<00:04:42.620> shut<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.010> Machine<00:04:43.100> off<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.790> batteries

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
and shut the Machine off the batteries

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.490 
and shut the Machine off the batteries
don't<00:04:44.300> last<00:04:44.420> as<00:04:44.780> long<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.080> seems<00:04:45.260> like<00:04:45.380> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
don't last as long it seems like the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.310 
don't last as long it seems like the
best<00:04:45.680> approach<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.430> hit<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.790> lawn<00:04:46.970> and

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
best approach is just hit the lawn and

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.690 
best approach is just hit the lawn and
get<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.410> all<00:04:48.530> done<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:49.100> quickly<00:04:49.430> as<00:04:49.640> possible

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
get it all done as quickly as possible

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.330 
get it all done as quickly as possible
and<00:04:50.390> not<00:04:50.480> take<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.930> know<00:04:51.050> skip<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.980> lemonade

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
and not take you know skip the lemonade

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.800 
and not take you know skip the lemonade
or<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.640> beer<00:04:52.820> break<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.360> middle<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.690> the

or the beer break in the middle of the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.520 
or the beer break in the middle of the
of<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.290> lawn<00:04:55.210> when<00:04:56.210> one<00:04:56.390> battery<00:04:56.810> winds<00:04:57.260> down

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
of the lawn when one battery winds down

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.440 
of the lawn when one battery winds down
the<00:04:58.010> other<00:04:58.190> one<00:04:58.310> automatically<00:04:58.880> spools<00:04:59.270> up

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
the other one automatically spools up

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.110 
the other one automatically spools up
you'll<00:04:59.600> notice<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.990> very<00:05:00.140> slight<00:05:00.880> spool<00:05:01.880> down

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
you'll notice a very slight spool down

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.700 
you'll notice a very slight spool down
of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.480> of<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.930> motor<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.470> then<00:05:03.590> the

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
of the of the motor and then the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.700 
of the of the motor and then the
secondary<00:05:04.250> battery<00:05:04.430> will<00:05:04.850> kick<00:05:05.030> up<00:05:05.560> that's<00:05:06.560> it

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
secondary battery will kick up that's it

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.990 
secondary battery will kick up that's it
for<00:05:06.860> now<00:05:06.950> which<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.190> my<00:05:07.310> second<00:05:07.610> report<00:05:07.850> on
