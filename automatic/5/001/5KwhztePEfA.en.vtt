00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 seriously the matter is that scorpion am 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460
 play a lot of mind do not need a hero 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 definitely cool by the way if you 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 read 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.260
 one of the interviews geiba he said well 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 this is one of his favorite characters sand king 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 yes yes don't be really surprised 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.040
 the mechanics are very cool guy can and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.829
 hide and ult he has chic there 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 massive plus camp but passivochka too 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.629
 quite pleasant and can also 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 ass than giving as for ruff one 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.899
 the hero is quite complicated in that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 few people can play well they can 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 be someone thinks that nude bullshit hero 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 there rolled instructed statue there 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.140
 pulled pulled pulnul 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 his chips in mid he is also in that with 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 tatoy common that is, they can be divided 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 pour on other people's statues attract your 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.360
 statues 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 and at Yoshi so that is using the statue 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.580
 mind be sure but nevertheless gershom 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 people usually play much worse and that 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.759
 wicked joke for the ruff 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 know how much i play in pubs 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990
 for example yes if there is a time before 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 necessarily this or but just full of cancer 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 who nifiga can not or man 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.520
 who plays well here is somehow not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 I saw almost average players on 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 this hero is quite low 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 win rate precisely because here's the usual 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.740
 or very good 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 sweaty guys on it or very bad 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.340
 noise and king is such an average hero i 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.100
 I think that all but somehow somehow 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.409
 can play and due to this he himself 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 feels much more confident mid only well 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.240
 plus he has the opportunity to farm for years 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.430
 it does not get in the spirit it is also affected by 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.770
 Of course , you can also feed at least 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.869
 this point until next. well all 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 know this tactic so nothing complicated 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.329
 there is definitely no well and y box 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.210
 him more 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.670
 and have a bigger box of course more sure he 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.979
 feels a little bit and based on 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.550
 this turns out the score of the day is enough 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.460
 offensive enough lamentable five points 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.590
 u sand king and two points u us why 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.730
 offensive well because I respect decides if 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.960
 but very interesting both jet hero 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.820
 I don't want to talk bad about him 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.980
 too good guy too good 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.900
