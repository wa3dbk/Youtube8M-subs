00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530 

from<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.580> made<00:03:38.970> something<00:03:39.240> that

from that we kind of made something that
I<00:03:39.570> think<00:03:40.100> even<00:03:41.100> today<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:41.880> kind<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.360> quite

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
I think even today is kind of quite

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.500 
I think even today is kind of quite
quite<00:03:43.530> beautiful<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:45.030> kind<00:03:45.480> of

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
quite beautiful and it's the kind of

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.450 
quite beautiful and it's the kind of
moving<00:03:45.780> image<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.410> what<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:46.740> intended<00:03:47.310> to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
moving image that what we intended to

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.760 
moving image that what we intended to
show<00:03:47.610> people<00:03:48.060> kind<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.420> more<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:48.840> showing

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
show people kind of more like showing

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.130

the<00:03:49.860> inside<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> my<00:03:50.490> head<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.730> suppose<00:03:51.180> well<00:03:51.840> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
the inside of my head I suppose well I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.450 
the inside of my head I suppose well I
was<00:03:52.470> asked<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:54.200> suggest<00:03:55.200> somebody<00:03:55.410> who<00:03:56.040> and

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
was asked to suggest somebody who and

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.550

could potentially change the face of
fashion<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:59.250> think<00:03:59.580> there's<00:04:00.000> very<00:04:00.180> few<00:04:00.240> people

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.000 
fashion I think there's very few people
who<00:04:01.700> really<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:03.300> fashion<00:04:03.750> film<00:04:04.020> well<00:04:04.650> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
there's very few people who actually do

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:23.530 
there's very few people who actually do
it<00:04:06.630> full<00:04:07.350> time<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.010> reached<00:04:08.250> us<00:04:08.460> both

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.960 

I've<00:04:24.540> always<00:04:24.750> loved<00:04:25.380> photography<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.730> felt

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
most comfortable behind a camera then

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.860 
most comfortable behind a camera then
