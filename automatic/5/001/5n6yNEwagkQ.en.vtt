 end the week Tuesday ana I have them 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.870

 we are also going to do a kind of 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 decorative curtain to decorate and 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.160
 to leave our room nice not 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.410
 They know how pretty the truth is to me 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300
 that I love I hope you 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.180
 also like it so let's see 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 What are the materials and how is it done? 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.800
 The materials that we will need are 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.440
 colored cardboards 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.420
 I'm going to use three colors but 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.430
 they can do it with one or all 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.979
 colors that you want and can 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.979
 to be of sewing or any finite thread 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:33.330
 transparent tape and plastic paste 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.310
 ment for paper the first thing we're going to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.410
 to do is draw shapes in the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 cardboard I'm going to make hearts 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.170
 can make circles triangles flowers 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.170
 what they want has to be something simple 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:06.660
 we have to do many after 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:08.910
 we cut now we cut the thread to the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.790
 height we want our curtain and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.430
 we tape a heart and in the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.810
 desired distance we paste another and another 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.810
 to finish with the thread 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.239
 do not 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.750
 now let's hit another heart on top 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.530
 so that you do not see linen that crosses the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:43.020
 heart we have to make several strips 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.760
 of the same length now we stick 'our 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.150
 strips on the wall with a little 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.550
 transparent tape and then so that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.250
 be neat we cut a strip of paper 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.900
 adhesive of the same width as the tape and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.090
 we stick it on and it's ready a curtain 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.730
 super cute to decorate the wall of the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.739
 fourth another alternative is to put it in the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.739
 door frame or ceiling 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.530
 today's video I hope you liked it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.880
 week Tuesday year I wanted to tell you that 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.880

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.140
 for me to make a video a day 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.080
 used to be only one a week 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.959
 It was a great challenge and the truth is that I passed it 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.630
 very well and I liked it very much and despite 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.790
 that I also get sick on the way 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.310
 of having to record the videos of all 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.380
 I liked to record them and I put them 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.840

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.850
