who have won each of the Rogers cups yet

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.500 
who have won each of the Rogers cups yet
the<00:00:07.890> game<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.280> waiting<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> next<00:00:09.240> three

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the game is waiting for the next three

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.780 
the game is waiting for the next three
the<00:00:09.660> next<00:00:09.960> generation<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.980> take<00:00:11.010> over<00:00:11.370> are

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the next generation to take over are

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.720 
the next generation to take over are
they<00:00:12.389> close<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.929> unseating<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.500> guard<00:00:13.830> or<00:00:14.490> not

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
they close to unseating the guard or not

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.640 
they close to unseating the guard or not
so<00:00:14.880> fast<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> bit<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> both<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.529> think

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
so fast I think a bit of both I think

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.359 
so fast I think a bit of both I think
that<00:00:17.039> definitely<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.560> making<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that definitely you know making the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.670 
that definitely you know making the
right<00:00:20.550> moves<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.180> right<00:00:21.359> results<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:21.990> but

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
right moves the right results now but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.490 
right moves the right results now but
now<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.220> consistency<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.500> winning

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
now it's about consistency and winning

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
now it's about consistency and winning
tournaments<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> end<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> day<00:00:27.109> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
tournaments at the end of the day the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.800 
tournaments at the end of the day the
way<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.590> tour<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> set<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> points

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
are from sammy's on finals and an

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
are from sammy's on finals and an
especially<00:00:33.960> victory<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
especially victory you know I'm just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
especially victory you know I'm just
saying<00:00:35.820> winning<00:00:36.000> arounds<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.510> 2000

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
saying winning arounds time is 2000

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
saying winning arounds time is 2000
points<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.620> losing<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.280> quarters<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
points and losing in the quarters of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
points and losing in the quarters of
Islam<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.690> 360<00:00:40.230> points<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.040> that's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
Islam I think it's 360 points so that's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
Islam I think it's 360 points so that's
a<00:00:41.790> tumble<00:00:42.090> leave<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> huge<00:00:42.629> gap<00:00:42.899> even<00:00:43.350> though

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a tumble leave a huge gap even though

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900 
a tumble leave a huge gap even though
quarters<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> still<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.340> result<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
quarters is a still a good result in a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.490 
quarters is a still a good result in a
slam<00:00:46.039> it's<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> big<00:00:48.210> point<00:00:48.510> gap<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
slam it's just it's a big point gap and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.080 
slam it's just it's a big point gap and
it's<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> Masters<00:00:50.940> once

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's the same thing at the Masters once

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
it's the same thing at the Masters once
I<00:00:51.210> was<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.809> Toronto<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.590> other

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I was like here in Toronto or other

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.389 
I was like here in Toronto or other
places<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.750> always<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
places it just you will always have that

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.950 
places it just you will always have that
difference<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.420> point<00:00:57.719> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
difference so that's that point it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
difference so that's that point it's
it's<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:58.920> playing<00:00:59.280> quarters<00:00:59.609> every

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's no good just playing quarters every

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
it's no good just playing quarters every
week<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.420> almost<00:01:00.629> rather<00:01:01.020> lose<00:01:01.260> first<00:01:01.530> round

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
week you almost rather lose first round

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
week you almost rather lose first round
a<00:01:01.829> couple<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.340> win<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> few<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> that's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a couple and then win a few and that's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
a couple and then win a few and that's
how<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.110> set<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> moment<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
how it's set up at the moment and I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.130 
how it's set up at the moment and I
think<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> tough<00:01:05.939> part<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
think that's a tough part for the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.660 
think that's a tough part for the
younger<00:01:07.380> guys<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.010> usually<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
younger guys because you usually have to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390 
younger guys because you usually have to
come<00:01:08.880> through<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.689> big<00:01:09.869> three<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
come through the big three big for you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
come through the big three big for you
know<00:01:11.520> once<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.030> twice<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.510> tournament<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> win

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
know once or twice a tournament to win

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
know once or twice a tournament to win
it<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.250> they're<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.549> ranked<00:01:14.880> top

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it and because they're not ranked top

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
it and because they're not ranked top
four<00:01:15.360> yet<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:16.409> maybe<00:01:16.799> even<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> be

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
four yet they maybe even have to be

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
four yet they maybe even have to be
three<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.659> four<00:01:19.020> top-10<00:01:19.409> players<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.979> just

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
three or four top-10 players that's just

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760 
three or four top-10 players that's just
a<00:01:20.189> hard<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.790> anyone<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> maybe

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
a hard thing to do for anyone so maybe

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.899 
a hard thing to do for anyone so maybe
that's<00:01:23.040> why<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that's why I think it's going to take a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
that's why I think it's going to take a
while<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:25.380> Murray<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> getting<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
while I think Murray is getting back to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
while I think Murray is getting back to
his<00:01:26.479> back<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> shape<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.170> playing<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:28.619> again

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
his back in shape I'm playing well again

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
his back in shape I'm playing well again
and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:29.759> Novak<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> Rafa<00:01:30.869> anyway<00:01:31.170> or

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and then also Novak and Rafa anyway or

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
and then also Novak and Rafa anyway or
playing<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> last<00:01:32.759> year<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.060> so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
playing so well for the last year or so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
playing so well for the last year or so
I<00:01:33.540> still<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:34.770> some

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I still think it's going to take some

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.410 
I still think it's going to take some
time<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.250> young<00:01:35.610> guys<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.150> really

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
time for young guys to really really

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
time for young guys to really really

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
break through but no doubt they have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219

before that i can't take those
tournaments<00:02:13.400> seriously<00:02:14.400> fully<00:02:15.180> seriously

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
tournaments seriously fully seriously

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
tournaments seriously fully seriously
because<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.019> did<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.890> back<00:02:17.430> issue<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.909> I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
because I did have a a back issue and I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
because I did have a a back issue and I
wasn't<00:02:18.329> fully<00:02:18.780> prepared<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.409> knew<00:02:19.739> going

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
wasn't fully prepared so I knew going

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610 
wasn't fully prepared so I knew going
into<00:02:20.189> the<00:02:20.340> US<00:02:20.549> Open<00:02:20.849> last<00:02:21.000> year<00:02:21.299> I'm<00:02:22.170> probably

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
into the US Open last year I'm probably

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.250 
into the US Open last year I'm probably
not<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.129> win<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> US<00:02:23.549> Open<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.260> with

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
not going to win the US Open and with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
not going to win the US Open and with
that<00:02:25.439> mindset<00:02:25.970> you're<00:02:26.970> not<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.299> win<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that mindset you're not going to win so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.360 
that mindset you're not going to win so
I<00:02:27.810> lost<00:02:28.079> in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> fourth<00:02:28.439> round<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.069> all<00:02:29.189> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I lost in the fourth round and all that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.770 
I lost in the fourth round and all that
stuff<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:29.909> for<00:02:30.090> me<00:02:30.329> was<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.569> good

stuff so I think for me was just good

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.860 
stuff so I think for me was just good
for<00:02:30.900> confidence<00:02:32.180> other<00:02:33.180> than<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.510> didn't

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
for confidence other than that I didn't

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.599 
for confidence other than that I didn't
need<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.260> good<00:02:34.500> result<00:02:34.829> at<00:02:34.920> Wimbledon<00:02:35.340> because

confidence<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> could<00:03:15.299> get<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.689> certain

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
confidence that I could get to certain

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.580 
confidence that I could get to certain
shots<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.620> lose<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.870> fun<00:03:19.109> out<00:03:19.530> there

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
shots I would lose the fun out there

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.140 
shots I would lose the fun out there
because<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.190> was<00:03:20.340> scared<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.819> getting<00:03:21.120> hurt

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
because I was scared of getting hurt

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.099 
because I was scared of getting hurt
again<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> think<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:23.040> got<00:03:23.459> me<00:03:24.019> made<00:03:25.019> me

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
again so I think that got me made me

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.170 
again so I think that got me made me
more<00:03:25.260> vulnerable<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.790> overall

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
more vulnerable you know just overall

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.089 
more vulnerable you know just overall
and<00:03:27.419> I<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.169> it<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:28.680> started<00:03:29.040> to

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
and I think it really all started to

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.830 
and I think it really all started to
come<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.370> at<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> end<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.909> last<00:03:30.060> year<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.810> I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
come back at the end of last year so I

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.270 
come back at the end of last year so I
think<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.139> was<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.379> big<00:03:31.560> stretch<00:03:31.859> for<00:03:32.099> me<00:03:32.190> at

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
think that was a big stretch for me at

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280 
think that was a big stretch for me at
the<00:03:32.370> indoor<00:03:32.609> season<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.269> made<00:03:33.449> finals<00:03:34.199> in

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the indoor season that I made finals in

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.229 
the indoor season that I made finals in
Basel<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.889> think<00:03:35.099> Sammy's<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.609> Paris<00:03:36.000> and

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
Basel I think Sammy's in Paris and

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
Basel I think Sammy's in Paris and
Sammy's<00:03:37.079> at<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.290> world<00:03:37.470> tour<00:03:37.680> finals<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.159> I

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
Sammy's at the world tour finals and I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.640 
Sammy's at the world tour finals and I
really<00:03:38.489> beat<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:38.699> think<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.060> five<00:03:39.299> or<00:03:39.480> six

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
really beat I think like five or six

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.930 
really beat I think like five or six
top-10<00:03:40.650> guys<00:03:40.889> which<00:03:41.159> I<00:03:41.280> didn't<00:03:41.519> do<00:03:41.609> basically

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
top-10 guys which I didn't do basically

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.789 
top-10 guys which I didn't do basically
all<00:03:42.120> year<00:03:42.359> long<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.199> for<00:03:43.409> that<00:03:43.500> standpoint

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
all year long so for that standpoint

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.330 
all year long so for that standpoint
that<00:03:44.129> really<00:03:44.430> set<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.760> tone<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.000> me<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:46.440> 2014

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
that really set the tone for me for 2014

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.969 
that really set the tone for me for 2014
and<00:03:47.819> now<00:03:48.449> it's<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.810> sort<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.169> back<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.620> normal

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
and now it's just sort of back to normal

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.800 
and now it's just sort of back to normal
in<00:03:50.040> my<00:03:50.250> opinion<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.599> did

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
in my opinion you know because I did

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.500 
in my opinion you know because I did
really<00:03:52.049> struggle<00:03:52.949> for<00:03:53.129> six<00:03:53.310> months<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.329> then

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
really struggle for six months and then

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.000 
really struggle for six months and then
clearly<00:03:54.750> also<00:03:55.109> attacked<00:03:55.349> my<00:03:55.470> confidence

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
clearly also attacked my confidence

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.789 
clearly also attacked my confidence
because<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.340> would<00:03:56.940> realize<00:03:57.659> that<00:03:58.319> my<00:03:58.500> shots

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
because I would realize that my shots

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.589 
because I would realize that my shots
are<00:03:58.949> not<00:03:59.069> there<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.549> my<00:03:59.819> movements<00:04:00.239> not<00:04:00.359> there

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
are not there and my movements not there

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.539 
are not there and my movements not there
so<00:04:01.409> things<00:04:01.620> are<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.769> more<00:04:03.829> it's<00:04:04.829> better<00:04:05.129> you

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
so things are just more it's better you

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.219 
so things are just more it's better you
know<00:04:05.669> and<00:04:05.879> I'm<00:04:06.090> from<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.449> standpoint<00:04:06.750> now<00:04:07.199> I

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
know and I'm from that standpoint now I

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.619 
know and I'm from that standpoint now I
can<00:04:07.500> play<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.769> freely<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.370> had<00:04:09.060> also<00:04:09.449> big

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
can play more freely I had also big

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.750

Slams the most important thing

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.310 
Slams the most important thing
or<00:04:26.250> not<00:04:26.460> no<00:04:27.180> they're<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.480> then<00:04:27.750> people<00:04:28.080> think

or not no they're not then people think

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.980 
or not no they're not then people think
they<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:29.250> because<00:04:30.090> Pete<00:04:30.330> Sampras<00:04:30.660> once

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
they are just because Pete Sampras once

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.950 
they are just because Pete Sampras once
upon<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.290> time<00:04:31.530> he<00:04:31.560> said<00:04:32.540> from<00:04:33.540> it's<00:04:33.720> all<00:04:33.810> about

upon a time he said from it's all about

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.020 
upon a time he said from it's all about
the<00:04:34.110> slams<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.220> think<00:04:35.460> everybody

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
the slams and then I think everybody

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300 
the slams and then I think everybody
figures<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:36.960> for<00:04:37.200> all<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.440> top<00:04:37.770> guys<00:04:38.010> or

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
figures that for all the top guys or

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.730 
figures that for all the top guys or
guys<00:04:38.550> like<00:04:38.850> me<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.180> Rafa<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.990> only<00:04:40.410> about<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
guys like me or Rafa it's only about the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.550 
guys like me or Rafa it's only about the
slams<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.480> which<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> is<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:43.170> me<00:04:43.200> that's

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
slams and which it is not for me that's

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.890 
slams and which it is not for me that's
why<00:04:43.710> I'm<00:04:43.890> i<00:04:44.160> am<00:04:44.550> here<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:44.910> Toronto<00:04:45.360> that's<00:04:45.690> why

why I'm i am here in Toronto that's why

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.800 
why I'm i am here in Toronto that's why
I<00:04:46.410> play<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> full<00:04:47.400> schedule<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.000> ATP<00:04:48.270> Tour<00:04:48.570> I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
play from january to november if it was

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.670 
play from january to november if it was
only<00:04:51.630> about<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.410> slams<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:54.170> my<00:04:55.170> sched<00:04:55.500> would

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
only about the slams and my sched would

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.740 
only about the slams and my sched would
be<00:04:55.800> entirely<00:04:56.040> different<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.420> there's<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:57.660> much

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
be entirely different so there's so much

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.480 
be entirely different so there's so much
more<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.290> than<00:04:58.500> just<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.830> slams<00:04:59.070> clearly

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
more to it than just the slams clearly

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.790 
more to it than just the slams clearly
they<00:04:59.640> take<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.910> huge<00:05:00.180> part<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.510> our<00:05:00.630> game<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.230> love

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
they take a huge part in our game I love

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.410 
they take a huge part in our game I love
those<00:05:01.950> tournaments<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.580> plate<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.850> think<00:05:02.940> over

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
those tournaments of plate I think over

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.610 
those tournaments of plate I think over
almost<00:05:04.050> 50<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> row<00:05:04.830> now<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.230> always<00:05:07.380> want

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
almost 50 in a row now so I always want

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.980 
almost 50 in a row now so I always want
to<00:05:07.650> show<00:05:07.830> up<00:05:08.010> there<00:05:08.220> show<00:05:08.630> showcase<00:05:09.630> what<00:05:09.870> you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
to show up there show showcase what you

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.360 
to show up there show showcase what you
got<00:05:10.170> there<00:05:10.440> because<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.860> is<00:05:10.980> sort<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.250> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
got there because it is sort of the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.100 
got there because it is sort of the
biggest<00:05:11.670> stage<00:05:11.910> besides<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.690> world<00:05:12.900> tour

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
biggest stage besides the world tour

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.720 
biggest stage besides the world tour
finals<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.650> rankings<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.250> my<00:05:14.370> opinion<00:05:15.020> so

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
finals and the rankings in my opinion so

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.140 
finals and the rankings in my opinion so
but<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.970> cannot<00:05:18.870> forget<00:05:19.290> what<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.700> base<00:05:20.880> at

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
but I cannot forget what is the base at

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.670 
but I cannot forget what is the base at
the<00:05:21.240> base<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.690> ATP<00:05:22.020> Tour<00:05:22.230> and<00:05:22.260> that's

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
the base is the ATP Tour and that's

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.890 
the base is the ATP Tour and that's
where<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.280> can<00:05:23.580> make<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.180> lot<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.420> points<00:05:24.840> you

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
where you can make a lot of points you

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.300 
where you can make a lot of points you
can<00:05:24.990> make<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.380> name<00:05:25.560> for<00:05:25.620> yourself<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:26.190> can

can make a name for yourself you can
beat<00:05:26.460> other<00:05:26.640> top-10<00:05:27.060> players<00:05:27.360> that's<00:05:28.290> where

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
beat other top-10 players that's where

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.550 
beat other top-10 players that's where
the<00:05:28.620> family<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:29.070> at<00:05:29.370> home<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.230> so<00:05:31.230> that's<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
the family is at home and so that's that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.950 
the family is at home and so that's that

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
point yeah it's it's not the most

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.200

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
it's pretty simple really it's just

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.220

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
on grass court it's just about getting

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.050 
on grass court it's just about getting
used<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.890> movement<00:05:56.010> because<00:05:56.669> you<00:05:56.820> feel

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
used to the movement because you feel

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.510 
used to the movement because you feel
like<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.330> can<00:05:57.480> get<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.830> it's<00:05:58.830> easy<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.220> move<00:05:59.370> on

like you can get to it's easy to move on

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.920 
like you can get to it's easy to move on
the<00:05:59.610> hard<00:05:59.790> courts<00:05:59.880> but<00:06:00.270> in<00:06:00.360> a<00:06:00.390> way<00:06:00.540> it's<00:06:00.690> not

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
the hard courts but in a way it's not

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.900 
the hard courts but in a way it's not
because<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.620> feel<00:06:01.950> like<00:06:01.980> you<00:06:02.190> can<00:06:02.370> stop<00:06:02.730> on<00:06:02.850> a

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
because I feel like you can stop on a

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.880 
because I feel like you can stop on a
dime<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.390> change<00:06:03.750> direction<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.440> it's<00:06:04.560> hard

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
dime and change direction and it's hard

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.470 
dime and change direction and it's hard
on<00:06:04.980> the<00:06:05.100> body<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.430> sometimes<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.150> body<00:06:06.300> is

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
on the body and sometimes the body is

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.120 
on the body and sometimes the body is
not<00:06:06.570> willing<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:06.900> do<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:07.260> so<00:06:07.800> you've<00:06:07.919> got<00:06:07.950> to

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
not willing to do it so you've got to

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.620 
not willing to do it so you've got to
get<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.430> right<00:06:08.580> mindset<00:06:09.030> into<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.480> that

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
get the right mindset into it that

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.170 
get the right mindset into it that
you're<00:06:09.780> just<00:06:09.930> happy<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:11.070> be<00:06:11.760> hurting<00:06:11.970> out

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
you're just happy to be hurting out

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.640 
you're just happy to be hurting out
there<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.480> little<00:06:12.630> bit<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.020> now<00:06:13.169> this<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.530> the

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
there a little bit and now this is the

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.140 
there a little bit and now this is the
beginning<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:14.070> eight<00:06:14.310> months<00:06:14.610> on<00:06:14.700> hard<00:06:14.910> court

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
beginning of eight months on hard court

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.720 
beginning of eight months on hard court
for<00:06:15.330> me<00:06:15.450> basically<00:06:15.660> i<00:06:15.990> will<00:06:16.290> be<00:06:16.380> playing<00:06:16.730> hard

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
for me basically i will be playing hard

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.760 
for me basically i will be playing hard
courts<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.300> be<00:06:18.540> Indian<00:06:18.810> Wells<00:06:18.990> next<00:06:19.410> year<00:06:19.620> and

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
courts to be Indian Wells next year and

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.190 
courts to be Indian Wells next year and
so<00:06:20.550> from<00:06:20.700> that<00:06:20.730> standpoint<00:06:21.150> it's<00:06:21.600> just<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.840> lot

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
so from that standpoint it's just a lot

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.810 
so from that standpoint it's just a lot
of<00:06:22.320> hardcore<00:06:22.560> tennis<00:06:23.010> up<00:06:23.190> so<00:06:23.400> it's<00:06:23.520> just<00:06:23.580> about

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
of hardcore tennis up so it's just about

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.590 
of hardcore tennis up so it's just about
getting<00:06:23.880> used<00:06:24.480> to<00:06:24.630> it<00:06:25.910> hopefully<00:06:26.910> playing

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
getting used to it hopefully playing

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.810 
getting used to it hopefully playing
well<00:06:27.870> here<00:06:28.169> I'm<00:06:28.740> not<00:06:28.919> playing<00:06:28.980> quite<00:06:29.640> that

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
well here I'm not playing quite that

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.190 
well here I'm not playing quite that
well<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.120> in<00:06:30.240> practice<00:06:30.419> I'm<00:06:30.810> a<00:06:30.870> little<00:06:31.110> bit

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
well it in practice I'm a little bit

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.870 
well it in practice I'm a little bit
disappointed<00:06:31.860> but<00:06:32.010> then<00:06:32.160> again<00:06:32.280> I<00:06:32.430> might<00:06:32.760> be

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
disappointed but then again I might be

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.940 
disappointed but then again I might be
jetlagged<00:06:33.120> a<00:06:33.480> little<00:06:33.630> bit<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.590> still<00:06:34.740> early

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
jetlagged a little bit it is still early

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.560 
jetlagged a little bit it is still early
in<00:06:35.100> the<00:06:35.280> in<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.520> hardcourt<00:06:36.000> season<00:06:36.030> but

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
in the in the hardcourt season but

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.420 
in the in the hardcourt season but
that's<00:06:37.110> why<00:06:37.289> I<00:06:37.320> think<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.770> first<00:06:37.950> round<00:06:38.280> is

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
that's why I think the first round is

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.920 
that's why I think the first round is
huge<00:06:38.729> for<00:06:38.760> me<00:06:39.150> now<00:06:39.330> here<00:06:39.600> just
