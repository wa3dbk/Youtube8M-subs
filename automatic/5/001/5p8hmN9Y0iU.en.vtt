00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.340 

now<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.610> don't<00:00:40.000> think<00:00:40.239> boys<00:00:40.420> could<00:00:40.780> carry<00:00:40.870> that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.490 
far about a mile the way people are kind
of<00:00:47.620> wondering<00:00:48.220> why<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:49.020> pay<00:00:50.020> so<00:00:50.079> much<00:00:50.320> attention

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
of wondering why I pay so much attention

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.450 
of wondering why I pay so much attention
to<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.460> apples<00:00:51.940> not<00:00:52.360> any<00:00:53.350> other<00:00:53.530> food<00:00:54.430> sources

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
to the apples not any other food sources

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.740 
to the apples not any other food sources
around<00:00:55.210> here<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:58.060> simple<00:00:58.480> law<00:00:58.690> of

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
around here and it's a simple law of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.800 
around here and it's a simple law of
nature<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.910> animals<00:01:00.910> don't<00:01:01.180> want<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.570> just

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
nature that animals don't want to just

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.210 
nature that animals don't want to just
survive<00:01:02.610> if<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:03.760> want<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.149> thrive<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.530> needs

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
survive if you want to thrive it needs

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.929 
survive if you want to thrive it needs
to<00:01:06.460> be<00:01:06.640> enough<00:01:06.939> food<00:01:07.329> to<00:01:08.040> support<00:01:09.040> them<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to be enough food to support them and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.550 
to be enough food to support them and
their<00:01:12.939> young

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.899 

and<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.700> pay<00:01:17.210> attention<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:18.399> where<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.640> food

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
and so I pay attention to where the food

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.620 
and so I pay attention to where the food
is<00:01:20.530> now<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.590> apples<00:01:22.189> really<00:01:22.850> don't<00:01:23.090> happen

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
is now the apples really don't happen

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.679 
is now the apples really don't happen
until<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.439> know<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.460> November<00:01:26.000> timeframe

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
until you know the November timeframe

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.590
