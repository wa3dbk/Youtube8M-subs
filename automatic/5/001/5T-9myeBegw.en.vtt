00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 When in an episode I mentioned how to correctly pronounce the word "door", 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.820
 I received several letters asking them to explain how to pronounce other words correctly. 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.400
 That is why today is about it. I will help you dispel your doubts about the correct pronunciation. 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.860
 We will start with "jam", or how to properly pronounce the word "jam". 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.880
 Well, I will probably surprise you, but the word "jam" is simply pronounced JAM [jam]. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 /laugh/ 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.180
 There are not any [there] or there [junk]. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.960
 Why do you so complicate your life? Why complicate life? / murmurs under the nose "no ja nie wiem" / 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.520
 [JAM], well, [JAM] and now. End. 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 It was sweet, now it's hot. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 Unless someone likes gentle, it's a bit mildly. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.880
 It will be about "ketchup". Well, the word "ketchup" can be pronounced in two ways. 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 Either [ketchup] or [keczap]. 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.880
 The word [ketchup] suits me better. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.280
 [keczap] sounds somehow too much ... in English. But of course you can say that. 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.640
 But! If we have the word "ketchup" and "CZ", we do not pronounce it any more [keczap]. We are already pronouncing [ketchup]. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 [keczap] are pronounced only if it is written in English, meaning "ketchup". 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.480
 It is then in two ways: either [ketchup] or [keczap]. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.040
 Well, we ate dinner, then we go to sleep ... In pajamas. That is the word 'pajamas'. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.220
 One can speak [p'imama], one can speak [p'idżama]. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.500
 / laughter of despair / Well, you can say what to do, [p'idżama]. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.860
 However, one can not speak [five-yama] or [five-yu-ma]. 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 / by śmiech / I really do not know who has such doubts ... 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.340
 Some also have problems with saying the word "reed" and nothing strange, because we have a lot of freedom here. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660
 We can express this word in three different ways: 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.640
 Let me start with the least pedantic pronunciation, i.e. [cz-ćina], which is the effect of phonetic simplification and is acceptable. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 A bit more pedantic is [cz-sz-ćina]. 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 And the most careful pronunciation is [t-sz-ćina]. 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.780
 And I encourage you to the most careful form, of course. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.760
 Many problems are also caused by the words that came to us quite recently from other languages. 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.460
 One of these words is "lamborghini". 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 Most of us are [lambordinises] because they think that this word probably came to us from English, and it is not. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.160
 The name from which the name of the car is derived is Italian. So we say [lamborgini], not [-jini]. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.700
 As we are in Italy, maybe I will mention "spaghetti". Just spagetti, not any [spagetti]. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.600
 And this is "bolognese. Poles like bolognese the most, because there is the most meat there. 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.280
 And best of all in Bologna. Oh, it will be easier and you know ... Bolognese and heya! 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.260
 Similarly, "bruschetta". We say [brusketta], and not none [bruszczetta]. In Italian: [brusket.ta]. [brusketta], well, in Polish, no? /laugh/ 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.620
 "Tortilla" I will not roll, because it is known that [tor.'ti.ʎa], nie [tor.'ti.lla]. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:57.540
 And if you want to prepare a tortilla, spaghetti or other bruschetta, it's worth shopping for ... Carrefour. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.880
 Well, [karfura], not [kerfura], because this word comes from French and sounds more or less like [kar.fur]. 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.240
 Speaking [kerfur], we refer to English, unnecessarily, unnecessarily ... 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.100
 Especially that the French are overly sensitive to their language, so if they hear that we are speaking after them, but with English sound, 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.240
 they can get pissed off and prices in Carrefour will be raised. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.580
 And staying in France, maybe about "croissants." 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.600
 Well, not [kurosants]. Well, what [kurosanty]? 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 What [chicken]? /laugh/ 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.720
 [Krłasɑnty]. Although I think that if you ask in the shop for French croissants, you will still get the same. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.240
 Of course, to be clear on this point, sometimes it is better to rearrange something, rotate ... 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.700
 For example, it's easier to talk [wifi] than [lajfaj] 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.380
 or [sushi] instead of [suʃʲi]. 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.320
 And I even understand it, and I support it. Then our speech apparatus does not tire so much, it is easier, shorter, more economically. 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.780
 However, if there is no justification for introducing such changes, then why? 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.320
 But of course, I will repeat it once again, do whatever you like.
