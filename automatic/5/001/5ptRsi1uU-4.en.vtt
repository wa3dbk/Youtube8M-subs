to a stylist probably this weekend and
try<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.390> she<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.689> flat<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.110> her<00:01:58.229> knee

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
try to see if she can flat on her knee

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.990 
try to see if she can flat on her knee
because<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.100> might<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.640> flat<00:01:59.880> iron

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because you might just be my flat iron

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.959 
because you might just be my flat iron
but<00:02:00.540> from<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> tried<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.619> will<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.009> go

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
but from what I tried it will not go

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.289 
but from what I tried it will not go
straight<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:04.320> noticed<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.490> 16<00:02:06.270> inch

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
straight and I noticed that the 16 inch

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.559 
straight and I noticed that the 16 inch
that<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.819> like<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.390> as

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
know the length is still the same still

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.560 
know the length is still the same still
comes<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.900> there<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:56.850> that's<00:03:57.850> not<00:03:58.120> much<00:03:58.360> I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
comes out there and that's not much I

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.650 
comes out there and that's not much I
can<00:03:58.630> really<00:03:58.780> say<00:03:59.380> except<00:04:00.280> has<00:04:00.910> more<00:04:01.150> pros<00:04:01.420> that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
can really say except has more pros that

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.970 
can really say except has more pros that
has<00:04:01.840> cons<00:04:02.110> except<00:04:02.560> for<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.769> fact<00:04:02.860> that

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
has cons except for the fact that

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.009 
has cons except for the fact that
haven't<00:04:03.880> been<00:04:03.910> able<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.209> fight<00:04:04.420> already<00:04:04.600> and

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
haven't been able to fight already and

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.280 
haven't been able to fight already and
it<00:04:05.140> has<00:04:05.350> thinned<00:04:05.950> out<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.190> little<00:04:06.489> bit<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:07.810> i

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
it has thinned out a little bit but i

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.310 
it has thinned out a little bit but i
would<00:04:08.920> recommend<00:04:09.400> some<00:04:09.880> people<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.810> get<00:04:10.989> three

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
would recommend some people to get three

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.380 
would recommend some people to get three
bundles<00:04:11.530> even<00:04:12.519> if<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:12.700> don't<00:04:12.850> use<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.209> full

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.729 
bundles even if you don't use the full
three<00:04:13.540> bundles<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.989> couldn't<00:04:14.260> put<00:04:14.410> any<00:04:14.530> more

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
three bundles I couldn't put any more
