00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
event warfare but it is boring to me now

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
event warfare but it is boring to me now
it's<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.320> dead<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.009> because

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
it's basically dead for me just because

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's basically dead for me just because
I<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.840> man<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.439> just

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I don't know what it is man it's just

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.050 
I don't know what it is man it's just
there<00:01:19.950> were<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.220> many<00:01:20.340> things<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.700> went<00:01:20.939> into

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
there were so many things that went into

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
there were so many things that went into
it<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> most<00:01:21.840> important<00:01:22.320> thing<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
it I think the most important thing that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.370 
it I think the most important thing that
kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.100> killed<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.520> me<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.140> not<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> lot

different it was so enjoyable it was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.259 
different it was so enjoyable it was
enjoyable<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.370> watch<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.849> know<00:02:22.970> people

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269

wanted a different call of duty people

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.440 
wanted a different call of duty people
had<00:02:25.190> been<00:02:25.340> asking<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.879> different<00:02:26.239> call<00:02:26.360> of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
duty four years and I think advanced

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.699 
duty four years and I think advanced
warfare<00:02:29.480> did<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> great<00:02:30.049> job<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.590> know

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
different I definitely think that the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.880 
different I definitely think that the
exosuit<00:02:35.030> was<00:02:35.209> an<00:02:35.330> improvement<00:02:35.599> but<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.769> know

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
exosuit was an improvement but you know

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.740 
exosuit was an improvement but you know
after<00:02:37.040> years<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.610> asking<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.330> all<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.599> stuff

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
after years of asking for all this stuff

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.569 
after years of asking for all this stuff
that<00:02:38.930> people<00:02:39.379> wanted<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.890> different<00:02:40.370> type<00:02:40.549> of

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
that people wanted a different type of

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.030 
that people wanted a different type of
call<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> duty<00:02:41.360> they<00:02:41.959> finally<00:02:42.200> delivered<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
call of duty they finally delivered and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.289 
call of duty they finally delivered and
people<00:02:43.280> didn't<00:02:43.489> play<00:02:43.670> which<00:02:43.879> seemed<00:02:44.150> really

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
people didn't play which seemed really

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.770 
people didn't play which seemed really
weird<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.650> videos<00:02:46.069> just<00:02:46.970> did<00:02:47.269> terrible

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
weird and the videos just did terrible

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
weird and the videos just did terrible
you<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:47.930> seemed<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.410> nobody<00:02:48.769> liked

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
you know seemed like nobody liked

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.030 
you know seemed like nobody liked
watching<00:02:49.910> advanced<00:02:50.540> warfare<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.500> would

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
watching advanced warfare and I would

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.770 
watching advanced warfare and I would
have<00:02:52.129> probably<00:02:52.280> continued<00:02:52.910> playing<00:02:53.359> advanced

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
have probably continued playing advanced

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.300 
have probably continued playing advanced
warfare<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.230> uploading<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.769> lot<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.010> advanced

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
warfare and uploading a lot of advanced

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
warfare and uploading a lot of advanced
warfare<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.840> views<00:02:57.140> are<00:02:57.170> pretty

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
warfare if the views are pretty

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.339 
warfare if the views are pretty
consistent<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:59.030> seems<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.109> know

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
consistent but it seems like you know

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.839 
consistent but it seems like you know
nobody<00:03:00.739> likes<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.069> watch<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:01.819> reason

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
nobody likes to watch it for some reason

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.640 
nobody likes to watch it for some reason
because<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.569> do<00:03:02.690> think<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.379> an

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
because I do think that it's an

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.319 
because I do think that it's an
entertaining<00:03:03.829> game<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:05.030> would<00:03:05.239> have

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
entertaining game and I would have

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.849 
entertaining game and I would have
