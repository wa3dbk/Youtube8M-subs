00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
told you in my video mail about the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.480 
told you in my video mail about the
first<00:02:20.550> generation<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:21.150> nano<00:02:21.360> machines<00:02:22.490> hmm

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
first generation of nano machines hmm

first generation of nano machines hmm
the<00:02:24.000> ones<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.450> stuck<00:02:24.780> me<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.230> Moses<00:02:25.740> yes

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the ones you stuck me with it Moses yes

the ones you stuck me with it Moses yes
the<00:02:27.600> Nano<00:02:27.810> machines<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.350> recharged<00:02:28.920> by<00:02:29.160> your

they won't stop functioning until

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.740 
they won't stop functioning until
they're<00:02:32.070> all<00:02:32.220> extracted<00:02:33.110> or<00:02:34.110> until<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.680> do

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
they're all extracted or until you do

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.090 
they're all extracted or until you do
most<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.959> them<00:02:37.050> were<00:02:37.200> lost<00:02:37.410> through<00:02:37.650> bleeding

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
most of them were lost through bleeding

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.050 
most of them were lost through bleeding
and<00:02:38.220> excretion

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and excretion

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.790

but<00:02:39.180> around<00:02:39.360> 30<00:02:39.690> percent<00:02:39.930> still<00:02:40.470> remain

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800

inside your body attached to yourselves
the<00:02:45.360> first<00:02:45.600> generation<00:02:46.170> were<00:02:46.290> never<00:02:46.530> ID

the first generation were never ID

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.590 
the first generation were never ID
registered<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:47.940> react<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
same way as the SOP nano machines but

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.420 
same way as the SOP nano machines but
they<00:02:52.140> may<00:02:52.320> be<00:02:52.350> interfering<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.130> your<00:02:53.220> body

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
they may be interfering with your body

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.100 
they may be interfering with your body

and with your heart

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.400 
and with your heart
mm-hmm<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.550> does<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.540> aging<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.050> something

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
mm-hmm so does the aging have something

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.150 
mm-hmm so does the aging have something
