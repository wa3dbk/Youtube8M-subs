00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:10.610
 Yes this time how to grow chrysanthemum I would like to talk about doing very dangerous 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:14.450
 Is different things to say of the sides of the petals in full there will this say Obayashi 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.150
 If there is something like Margaret, then Pompom Yes 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.150
 Some things small stature say this after 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.600
 The big thing of a petal 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:31.540
 Yes and there are many number of such sound path softly defense that petal 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.720
 There are a lot of kinds Yes There are three ways to grow chrysanthemum 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.610
 Yes 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.450
 The first one is on the spot that you give fertilizer 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.060
 Because it is the kind of publication grass to come out from 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 I am giving a lot at the time when I am billing 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.550
 And 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:55.180
 Another one is easy to get pests like this beautiful flower 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 You should do nothing and suppress it, but you also like insects like this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.890
 Unusual things 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.890
 So after bombing you have aphids 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.070
 later 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.850
 Because worms and caterpillars are easy to attach 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.390
 It is rust disease arm and Aomushisabi disease arm and aphids in mind those of pest measures 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.600
 let me in 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.510
 I think as if you can be a drug 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.970
 Yes and one more thing 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.840
 Pruning branches is yes 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.159
 By any means- 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.270
 When I grow up, the center system gets more and more high and the leaf that I said is getting brownish 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 It says little is Do not bad looks I made 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 There is a lot of consultation It is that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:49.719
 Ella is growing, and if it gets more and more , yeah to make this tip live 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.189
 It says to concentrate the nutrients in the center dropped to the leaf tea force 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:58.840
 Well, I think that the plants have a lot of thought and want to drop off the tea 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:02.159
 Street Well it nutrients that story to Well year that beginning to the effect that because not enough 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.539
 It will be important that you do the fertilizer part 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.690
 Well , because it is a plant that has a very creeping branch. 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:15.810
 Yes I cut it back to Edo 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.220
 If it breaks down, nutrition will branch more and more, for example temporarily without going 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.150
 Even if it branches off from the day 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.599
 Go to the withered leaves it was coming went extending gradually concentrated on around here strangely in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 It becomes 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:37.430
 It is time to cut branches 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:40.939
 As a time, first cut off in early spring a. But Harayuki snow has been solved and this is a miracle 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.760
 It's snowing in the area where I am crawling 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:47.700
 a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:50.220
 If sprouting comes out and you see it once, please stop it once and if it is stopped 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.319
 Just give in Japan Part III 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.819
 Hey yeah 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:03.090
 If you wear it once more, please cut it still until about 2 months before flowering 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.290
 If it is chrysanthemum blooming in autumn, it will bloom in September and October 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.450
 It's almost like you should cut it by August . 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.450
 Chrysanthemum blooming in the book to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:24.540
 I will win, but until June it is better to cut by the end of 6 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:25.650
 The growth is different depending on the new species , so the varieties with very good growth can be cut several times each time 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.990
 It is good 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.700
 The day-to-day varieties are too low in horizontal height if cut too many times 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.850
 Because my nose will be covered 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:42.730
 Let's grow it and look at the state of the government and it's breed 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.660
 When the most part species cuts back I'm tailored you are listening once to twice a year 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.330
 What 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.590
 Stature will also suppressed Shia 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:55.660
 I think it will also prevent the re-recording of the leaves 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:00.459
 It was very easy to your description, but then you have heard of the kind very full type 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:06.120
 Other than cut flowers that I will give to the tomb 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:08.460
 This is an opportunity because it is a plant that is also very useful for coloring in the lower part 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.740
 Please try to grow various types of chrysanthemum 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.410
 This time in that 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.410
 The upbringing of chrysanthemum we have to introduce
