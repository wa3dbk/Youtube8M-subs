00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 cancer then comes in uncomfortable clothes and in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.879
 inappropriate moment 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.649
 therefore none of the parks and the mountaineer 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.630
 prepare you for real self defense 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.820
 however, the benefits of doing it are definitely 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 a large reaction you have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 endurance participating in competitions 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 is fighting spirit 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.359
 if you want to prepare yourself for 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.130
 street defense 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.230
 do not dwell on any species 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 martial arts best system 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 can only be combined 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.580
 so I advise you to do 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.070
 hand-to-hand combat 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.529
 combining elements of boxing karate 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.850
 and wrestling and to sports 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 hand-to-hand combat 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.920
 prepare for real 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.110
 self-defense 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 by the way we prepared two films on the subject 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.520
 sports hand-to-hand combat in which 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770
 more than 70 receptions demonstrated 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 shock technique and more than 30 receptions 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 The fight film is shown only 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
 those tricks that you can really 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.620
 apply in a duel they are all tested 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.620
 in practice and reviewed their concepts 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.170
 this combination we will show you only by 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 to air 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 The first opponent of this type repulsed in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 shin or knee kick to the knee is longer 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 so when choosing a goal, consider 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.939
 drive a second striker out of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.979
 by hitting the edge of the palm in the neck or 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.330
 throat if you miss you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.820
 get on lips or nose 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.500
 which is also a good 3 so leave or 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
 counterattack leave base and edge 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 palm and go immediately to finish 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.740
 for example second hitter side 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 a blow to the knee joint this blow can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.680
 put with a jump if the opponent 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 went away so he will turn out even more powerful 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 side impact to the knee joint 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.650
 effectively applied to any area 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.659
 the joint 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.130
 however, like a knee kick better than him 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.280
 use as a counterstrike and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 finishing off from him is undesirable he 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.579
 not as fast as picking up but 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.560
 not inferior in strength 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.869
 work hard on this punch 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.869
 at lateral attacks it is simply irreplaceable 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 look again slowed down performances 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.360
 don't forget to work and and with a partner and 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.360
 on paws
