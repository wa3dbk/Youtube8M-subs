some<00:02:06.299> some<00:02:06.719> simple<00:02:07.110> quilting<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
some some simple quilting in it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
some some simple quilting in it
so<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.690> first<00:02:08.899> thing<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.200> need<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:09.500> do<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
so the first thing I need to do is to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.259 
so the first thing I need to do is to
pull<00:02:10.369> up<00:02:10.459> my<00:02:10.489> bobbin<00:02:11.060> thread<00:02:12.879> so<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:13.910> make<00:02:14.120> the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
pull up my bobbin thread so I make the

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.610 
pull up my bobbin thread so I make the
first<00:02:14.480> stitch<00:02:14.930> pull<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.099> stitch<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:17.440> pull<00:02:18.440> my

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
first stitch pull that stitch up pull my

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:37.240 
first stitch pull that stitch up pull my
threads<00:02:18.980> out<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.950> slide<00:02:22.220> them<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.670> back

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.520 

this<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.970> pitching<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.690> ditch<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.110> ideal

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
this is pitching in the ditch and ideal

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.480 
this is pitching in the ditch and ideal
I<00:02:39.590> would<00:02:40.550> be<00:02:40.730> right<00:02:41.120> down<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.160> same<00:02:43.160> line

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
I would be right down in that same line

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.940 
I would be right down in that same line
but<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.210> can't<00:02:44.510> get<00:02:44.690> far<00:02:44.960> enough<00:02:45.140> over<00:02:45.470> it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
but I can't get far enough over it

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040 
but I can't get far enough over it
without<00:02:46.430> obstructing<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.510> view<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:48.020> the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
without obstructing the view to the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.910 
without obstructing the view to the
camera<00:02:49.060> normally<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.840> sitting<00:02:51.110> like

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
camera normally I will be sitting like

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.980 
camera normally I will be sitting like
this<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.700> can<00:02:52.910> actually<00:02:53.090> see<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
this so that I can actually see the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.930 
this so that I can actually see the
needle<00:02:54.350> going<00:02:54.770> between<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.340> two<00:02:55.370> pieces<00:02:55.730> of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
needle going between the two pieces of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.990 
needle going between the two pieces of
fabric<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.380> spread<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.890> fabrics<00:02:58.430> open

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
fabric and if I spread the fabrics open

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.660 
fabric and if I spread the fabrics open
and<00:02:59.270> sew<00:02:59.600> right<00:02:59.630> between<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.650> when<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> let<00:03:01.640> go

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
and sew right between them when I let go

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.360 
and sew right between them when I let go
the<00:03:02.390> fabric<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.020> on<00:03:03.200> top<00:03:03.500> will<00:03:03.800> fold<00:03:04.040> back

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the fabric that's on top will fold back

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.460 
the fabric that's on top will fold back
over<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.910> stitch<00:03:05.300> line<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.140> will<00:03:06.260> be

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
over that stitch line and you will be

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:34.800 
over that stitch line and you will be
able<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.890> see<00:03:07.070> it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.960 

that's<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.530> adjust<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.160> stitches<00:03:36.670> to

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
that's going to adjust the stitches to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
that's going to adjust the stitches to
slightly<00:03:37.690> locum<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:40.510> machine<00:03:40.900> doesn't<00:03:41.170> have

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
slightly locum this machine doesn't have

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.470 
slightly locum this machine doesn't have
a<00:03:42.390> numbered<00:03:43.390> stitch<00:03:44.020> length<00:03:44.980> adjustment<00:03:45.700> it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
a numbered stitch length adjustment it

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.720 
a numbered stitch length adjustment it
just<00:03:46.810> has<00:03:47.020> this<00:03:47.260> screw<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.160> further<00:03:48.400> out

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
just has this screw and the further out

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.850 
just has this screw and the further out
you<00:03:48.760> turn<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.569> smaller<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.230> stitches<00:03:50.680> are

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
you turn it the smaller the stitches are

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.040 
you turn it the smaller the stitches are
and<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.700> further<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:52.420> turn<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
and the further in you turn it the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.550 
and the further in you turn it the
larger<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.560> stitches<00:03:53.950> are<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.510> have<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.350> set

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
larger the stitches are so I have it set

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.620 
larger the stitches are so I have it set
pretty<00:03:57.250> far<00:03:57.520> out<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.300> would<00:03:58.420> get<00:03:58.569> a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
pretty far out so that I would get a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.930 
pretty far out so that I would get a
nice<00:03:59.230> smart<00:03:59.650> stitch<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.310> hold<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:00.670> group

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
nice smart stitch to hold this group

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.910 
nice smart stitch to hold this group
together<00:04:01.150> especially<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> homespun

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
together especially with the homespun

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.110 
together especially with the homespun
fabric<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.819> would<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.360> small<00:04:04.720> stage

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
fabric I would have a small stage

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.630 
fabric I would have a small stage
because<00:04:07.120> they<00:04:07.269> can<00:04:07.600> do<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.430> see

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
because they can do and you can see

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240 
because they can do and you can see
how<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.940> fabric<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.570> is<00:04:11.350> shifting<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
how the fabric is is shifting and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.920 
how the fabric is is shifting and
creating<00:04:12.760> this<00:04:12.910> wrinkle<00:04:13.390> right<00:04:13.660> here<00:04:13.900> I

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
creating this wrinkle right here I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.509 
creating this wrinkle right here I
wouldn't<00:04:14.350> normally<00:04:14.530> get<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.310> with<00:04:15.489> a

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
wouldn't normally get that with a

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.210 
wouldn't normally get that with a
walking<00:04:16.000> foot<00:04:16.329> or<00:04:16.600> will<00:04:17.019> normally<00:04:17.530> expected

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
walking foot or will normally expected

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.300 
walking foot or will normally expected
and<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:20.169> I'm<00:04:20.260> going<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.530> have<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.739> keep<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
and so I'm going to have to keep the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.180 
and so I'm going to have to keep the
keep<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.120> stretch<00:04:22.540> tall<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.740> backing

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
keep it stretch tall so that the backing

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.820 
keep it stretch tall so that the backing
fabric<00:04:24.460> stays<00:04:25.060> stretch<00:04:25.480> tall<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.620> don't

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
fabric stays stretch tall and I don't

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:41.320 
fabric stays stretch tall and I don't
end<00:04:26.979> up<00:04:27.100> with<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.310> puckered<00:04:27.729> spot

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.530 

love<00:04:41.870> how<00:04:42.080> quiet<00:04:42.440> this<00:04:42.710> machine

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.960 

a<00:04:45.630> walk<00:04:46.320> I'm<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.800> boiling<00:04:47.310> can<00:04:47.550> get<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.820> for

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
a walk I'm the boiling can get it for

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.840 
a walk I'm the boiling can get it for
loan<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.390> smoothly<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.140> quietly<00:04:53.660> that's<00:04:54.660> it
