copper's francs with the nitric acid

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:38.119 
copper's francs with the nitric acid
you're<00:00:34.149> saying<00:00:35.159> nitrous<00:00:36.159> oxide

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you're saying nitrous oxide

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.130 
you're saying nitrous oxide
which<00:00:38.699> is<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> gap<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.539> a<00:00:39.660> gas<00:00:39.870> that's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
which is a gap which is a gas that's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.200 
which is a gap which is a gas that's
going<00:00:40.410> through<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.760> some<00:00:41.940> copper

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
going through this is some copper

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.210 
going through this is some copper
comprar<00:00:45.140> nitrates<00:00:45.500> dissolved<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.190> water

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
comprar nitrates dissolved in the water

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.580 
comprar nitrates dissolved in the water
to<00:00:46.640> some<00:00:47.030> of<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.150> water<00:00:47.390> vapors<00:00:47.840> taking<00:00:48.470> that

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
to some of the water vapors taking that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.830 
to some of the water vapors taking that
through<00:00:49.480> it's<00:00:50.480> bubbling

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
through it's bubbling

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
through it's bubbling
using<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.260> second<00:00:53.620> reaction<00:00:53.890> going<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.310> this

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
using the second reaction going on this

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.220 
using the second reaction going on this
that<00:00:56.910> flask

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.320 

so<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.830> first<00:01:01.040> reactions<00:01:01.520> like<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.180> he

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
so the first reactions like this is he

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.180 
so the first reactions like this is he
is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
is

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.770 
is
the<00:01:03.580> second<00:01:03.880> reaction<00:01:04.090> takes<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.570> two

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
the second reaction takes like two

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.270 
the second reaction takes like two
minutes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.050 

okay<00:01:09.850> so

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.350 

okay<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.200> go<00:01:15.680> again<00:01:15.979> for<00:01:16.280> me<00:01:16.400> in<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:17.119> one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
okay so go again for me in this one

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.410 
okay so go again for me in this one
nitric<00:01:18.020> acid<00:01:18.380> nitric<00:01:18.830> acid<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.400> copper<00:01:19.760> and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
nitric acid nitric acid and copper and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.030 
nitric acid nitric acid and copper and
then<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:21.860> going<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.070> create<00:01:22.479> create

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
then it it's going to create create

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
then it it's going to create create
water<00:01:25.040> paper<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.240> gonna<00:01:26.360> create<00:01:26.920> nitrous

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
water paper it's gonna create nitrous

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.520 
water paper it's gonna create nitrous
oxide<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.990> copper<00:01:29.990> nitrate<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:33.200> copper

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
oxide and copper nitrate so copper

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.660 
oxide and copper nitrate so copper
nitrate<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:33.950> probably<00:01:34.190> will<00:01:34.280> be<00:01:34.340> staying<00:01:34.550> in

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
nitrate is probably will be staying in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.450 
nitrate is probably will be staying in
the<00:01:34.790> bottom<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.180> solid<00:01:35.979> nitrous<00:01:36.979> oxide<00:01:37.369> is

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the bottom is a solid nitrous oxide is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.539 
the bottom is a solid nitrous oxide is
going<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.850> react<00:01:38.210> with<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> water<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:39.549> guess

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
going to react with the water I guess

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.010 
going to react with the water I guess
it's<00:01:40.700> gonna<00:01:40.790> make<00:01:41.000> some<00:01:41.119> nitric<00:01:41.509> acid<00:01:41.899> in

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's gonna make some nitric acid in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.550 
it's gonna make some nitric acid in
there<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.610> how<00:01:43.759> will<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:43.970> know<00:01:44.350> I've<00:01:45.350> got<00:01:45.530> a

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
there and how will you know I've got a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.700 
there and how will you know I've got a
universal<00:01:46.039> indicator<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.440> helps<00:01:48.619> up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
universal indicator so that helps up

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.219 
universal indicator so that helps up
with<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.890> pH<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.520> -<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.179> beaker<00:01:50.990> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
with the pH of the - of the beaker and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.950 
with the pH of the - of the beaker and
the<00:01:51.740> flask<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:52.640> now<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:52.970> second<00:01:53.539> reactions

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the flask but now the second reactions

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.100 
the flask but now the second reactions
take<00:01:54.140> place<00:01:54.170> because<00:01:55.509> inside<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.690> see<00:01:56.899> what's

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
take place because inside to see what's

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.760 
take place because inside to see what's
going<00:01:57.320> if<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.649> can<00:01:57.800> see<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.440> glass<00:02:00.440> tube

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
going if you can see the the glass tube

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.809 
going if you can see the the glass tube
see<00:02:01.159> what's<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.550> on

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
see what's going on

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.080 
see what's going on
yeah<00:02:02.149> it's<00:02:02.330> bubbling<00:02:02.659> right<00:02:02.840> back<00:02:03.050> on<00:02:03.259> yeah<00:02:03.920> oh

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
yeah it's bubbling right back on yeah oh

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.889 
yeah it's bubbling right back on yeah oh
yeah<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.590> gas<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.190> being<00:02:07.899> it's

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
yeah so it's so gas is being it's

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.449 
yeah so it's so gas is being it's
pressure<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.800> little<00:02:09.950> barometer

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
pressure it's like a little barometer

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.800 
pressure it's like a little barometer
and<00:02:10.550> Sunday<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.030> couldn't<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.630> enough

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and Sunday I couldn't get enough

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.570 
and Sunday I couldn't get enough
pressure<00:02:12.050> last<00:02:12.380> time<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.709> try<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.310> I

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
pressure last time I try this but I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
pressure last time I try this but I
think<00:02:14.269> it's<00:02:14.480> gonna<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.080> time<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.350> got

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
think it's gonna do it this time I got

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.290 
think it's gonna do it this time I got
enough

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.050 

should<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.990> be<00:02:23.140> afraid<00:02:23.380> no<00:02:23.920> no<00:02:24.250> no<00:02:24.520> wait<00:02:24.760> till<00:02:24.910> it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
should I be afraid no no no wait till it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.580 
should I be afraid no no no wait till it
hits<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.330> second<00:02:25.690> chair<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.230> down<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
hits the second chair so down at the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.240 
hits the second chair so down at the
bottom<00:02:26.650> there's<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> green<00:02:27.820> fluid

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
bottom there's actually a green fluid

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.740 
bottom there's actually a green fluid
which<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.460> copper<00:02:31.240> nitrate

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
which is the copper nitrate

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.810 
which is the copper nitrate
there's<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.460> did<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.670> work

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
there's actually like it did it work

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.410 
there's actually like it did it work
last<00:02:34.120> time<00:02:34.240> let<00:02:35.170> me<00:02:35.200> do<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.940> I'm<00:02:36.940> taping<00:02:37.210> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
last time let me do this I'm taping it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.020 
last time let me do this I'm taping it
so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.570> don't<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.990> do<00:02:38.110> this

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.830 

that's<00:02:42.870> try<00:02:43.170> driving<00:02:44.100> water<00:02:44.400> there's<00:02:44.940> an<00:02:45.150> yep

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that's try driving water there's an yep

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:57.710 
that's try driving water there's an yep
let's<00:02:46.020> try<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> whole<00:02:48.320> Soviets<00:02:49.320> first<00:02:49.500> last

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.850 

I<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.410> pretty<00:02:58.710> good<00:03:00.530> they<00:03:01.530> don't<00:03:01.710> run

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
I had this pretty good they don't run

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:18.949 
I had this pretty good they don't run
out<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.040> water

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.539 

oh<00:03:19.099> yeah

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.369 

so<00:03:23.549> what<00:03:23.760> does<00:03:23.879> it<00:03:24.030> end<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.330> at<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.230> one's

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
so what does it end up at so this one's

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.670 
so what does it end up at so this one's
gonna<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:28.939> what's<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.000> next<00:03:31.340> second<00:03:32.340> reaction

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
gonna be what's the next second reaction

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.520 
gonna be what's the next second reaction
is<00:03:34.150> well<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.269> nitric<00:03:35.569> acid<00:03:35.870> close<00:03:36.019> water<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
is well this nitric acid close water the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:53.190 
is well this nitric acid close water the
first<00:03:36.769> one

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.050 

was<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.349> going<00:03:54.560> back<00:03:54.769> yeah<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.580> gonna<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.879> was

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
was it going back yeah it's gonna I was

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.510 
was it going back yeah it's gonna I was
there

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.550 

so<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.360> blue<00:04:01.600> just<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.080> universal

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
so is the blue just the universal

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.470 
so is the blue just the universal
indicated<00:04:03.010> no<00:04:03.340> no<00:04:03.700> no<00:04:03.850> that's<00:04:04.030> that's<00:04:04.210> that's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
indicated no no no that's that's that's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.060 
indicated no no no that's that's that's
it<00:04:04.660> gonna<00:04:04.810> be<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.960> copper<00:04:05.200> compound<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.770> guess

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
it gonna be a copper compound I guess

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.650 
it gonna be a copper compound I guess
maybe

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.330 

corporate<00:04:12.380> nitrate

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.930 

but<00:04:15.819> there<00:04:16.000> are<00:04:16.060> nothing<00:04:16.239> next<00:04:16.480> out<00:04:17.940> there's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
but there are nothing next out there's

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:33.220 
but there are nothing next out there's
nothing<00:04:19.209> less<00:04:19.419> than<00:04:19.570> this<00:04:19.690> Peter

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.200 

since<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> universal<00:04:34.070> indicator<00:04:34.250> read

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
since the universal indicator read

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.630 
since the universal indicator read
athlete

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.020 

so<00:04:40.640> it's<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.940> strong<00:04:42.550> passive

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.920 

yeah<00:04:49.990> yeah<00:04:51.330> yeah

you know all the public offers all the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.950 
you know all the public offers all the
nitrous<00:05:01.360> oxides

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
nitrous oxides

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.540 
nitrous oxides
please<00:05:02.380> be<00:05:02.560> going<00:05:02.919> well<00:05:03.250> Brown<00:05:03.580> is<00:05:04.289> reactive

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
please be going well Brown is reactive

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.860 
please be going well Brown is reactive
yeah<00:05:06.550> that's<00:05:06.940> impressive<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.539> acid

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
yeah that's impressive so is the acid

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.420 
yeah that's impressive so is the acid
only<00:05:10.990> on<00:05:11.199> top<00:05:11.440> isn't<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:12.039> that<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.310> hasn't

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
only on top isn't just that it hasn't

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.560 
only on top isn't just that it hasn't
met

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.930 

so<00:05:20.290> what's<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.710> power<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.370> acid<00:05:21.790> like

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
so what's the power of that acid like

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.790 
so what's the power of that acid like
what<00:05:22.120> could<00:05:22.270> we<00:05:22.360> do<00:05:22.570> that's<00:05:22.930> that's<00:05:23.350> gonna<00:05:23.620> be

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
what could we do that's that's gonna be

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.140 
what could we do that's that's gonna be
a<00:05:23.940> pH<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.060> 1<00:05:25.270> or<00:05:26.260> 2<00:05:26.290> Wow<00:05:26.950> that's<00:05:27.550> Australia's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
a pH of 1 or 2 Wow that's Australia's

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.800 
a pH of 1 or 2 Wow that's Australia's
it's<00:05:28.360> probably<00:05:28.690> before<00:05:28.840> nitric<00:05:29.440> acid<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.810> could

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it's probably before nitric acid I could

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.690 
it's probably before nitric acid I could
probably<00:05:31.990> redo<00:05:32.560> if<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.980> had<00:05:33.100> a<00:05:33.130> copper<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.550> that

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
probably redo if I had a copper to that

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.150 
probably redo if I had a copper to that
Oh<00:05:37.650> interesting

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
Oh interesting

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.310 
Oh interesting
and<00:05:39.700> it's<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.090> same<00:05:40.330> exact<00:05:40.690> acid<00:05:41.110> as<00:05:41.230> you

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
and it's the same exact acid as you

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.650 
and it's the same exact acid as you
started
