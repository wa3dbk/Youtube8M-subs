00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 creating the juliano belletti world in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.170
 tonight what I'm going to teach you is 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.550
 a very easy thing in the last video 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.550
 what I did was a speed test 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.080
 in this case as much as for the radios 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.720
 as for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.110
 some not that are not links but that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.090
 let's have about 750 one back 750 ml or one 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.090
 g or have a network 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 of the highest ranges I do not know if 10 36 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.270
 to 6 of 10 16 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:46.010
 14 33 what a place 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.109
 to links and already accept cards 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.839
 wireless with tubey kit and as a 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.870
 micro tic that in this case the example 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.989
 to make it quick easy simple it is 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.140
 how to know how much traffic can I spend 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.809
 one from one router work to another 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.659
 for the example I'm going to have this route 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.080
 global and will have another router board in 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.920
 which I'm going to prove how much happens to me 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.409
 one point to another 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 this is useful because if I do not have a link 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.770
 with ubiquity as I say, I have a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.090
 video in which he expressed which he explained 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.570
 that these steps to make it go wyk 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 test as it is considered as it is called in 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.200
 the marketing case where the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.050
 has simple tools 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.170
 mango and test tools where I'm going to 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.070
 test if I'm inside the channel to 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.760
 this case I have two public 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 those sent by ports for the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.520
 security case however for this 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 case 190 66 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.690
 that is up to the other point for this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.979
 for this case we are doing a jump 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.290
 of 33 highs in different points and 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.270
 I want to know how much I can spend because 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.200
 used 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 and password 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 and simply here is going to put between 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.099
 lawn full of hair because the packages 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.269
 we're going to have a test count a lot 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.159
 higher 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.940
 tcp protocol which is what we use 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.600
 to verify the internet download 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.880
 who I'm going to put to receive or 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.550
 send let's say I want to know when I'm 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.590
 downloading that is I look at the router that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.810
 is up let's say for my case I want 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.270
 know how much I can receive because this 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.000
 router is after the core router 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.330
 and I say this 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 as I say here I have several several 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.310
 configurations and there is one among this 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.100
 router already this although I'm doing the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.630
 try this 2 10 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:04.920
 I have several trunks I have one 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:07.620
 sectoral ubiquity and I have several 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.980
 teams through which we are by 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.160
 get to reach to develop about 17 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.630
 megas this we plan our 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.800
 end we also verify our 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.130
 links this can improve 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.130
 ostensibly 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 and let's say for 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.860
 for the real case that I'm driving in 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.740
 this moment there is no inconvenience 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.410
 saturation there is a drawback 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.010
 of sight lines that needs to be improved 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.990
 but then let the 20 21 mb pass 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.700
 well because it 's a 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.700
 a city where only 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.920
 About 15-20 users 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.130
 for this part 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.690
 stop and I have my screens to take 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.470
 measures to see how he is behaving 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.590
 the channel 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.220
 how fluctuating is it in terms of 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 discharge 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.700
 I want to know how much I can charge towards 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.140
 internet before saying send 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.140
 I put set and the same 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.150
 here we see that the transmission is much 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.140
 best 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.140
 that the reception 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.160
 today I'm going to take 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:25.300
 it tells me the average is 28 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.870
 average total transmission reception 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.930
 current total average 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.800
 all right 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:39.360
 I must take the steps to take my 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.340
 decisions or whatever you have between this 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.270
 route the board and another something very special 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.270
 is that if I want 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.520
 to have 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.439
 I do not want to know how much happened and I have a 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.229
 wifi network and I do not want to do it for merlo 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.909
 kind of connecting a router put a 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.009
 point to another rotor at the other end and 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.710
 just try if I have two I observe 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.210
 to 750 you can use them for these 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.850
 effects 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.880
 friends is not simple easier 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.220
 applicable we have a case of the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.280
 diarrhea 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.480
 then but again and in my networks 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.150
 social networks on YouTube as Julian covered 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.280
 on Facebook 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.100
 as you will see rooting the world with micro 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.680
 tics where we are dealing with very 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.670
 random 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.100
 can comment post 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.740
 and the community so there may be day 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.450
 grow in knowledge then it 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.240
 are going to live the one world ranking of the 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.949
 switch and networking in general 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.949
 health for all and felines
