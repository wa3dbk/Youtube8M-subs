value<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.399> close<00:01:35.429> but<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.600> outshot

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
value from up close but I got outshot

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
value from up close but I got outshot
when<00:01:37.319> I<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.679> first<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.609> when<00:01:38.639> I<00:01:38.789> shot

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
when I had the first like when I shot

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.239 
when I had the first like when I shot
the<00:01:39.240> first<00:01:39.389> bullet<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.409> submachine<00:01:41.100> gun

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
the first bullet with my submachine gun

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.730 
the first bullet with my submachine gun
which<00:01:41.399> has<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> should<00:01:42.240> win<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.109> close<00:01:43.439> range

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
which has it should win a close range

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
which has it should win a close range
whilst<00:01:44.429> having<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:44.729> first<00:01:44.939> shot<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
whilst having the first shot but he just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.389

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
Xbox one is a lot better and I will be

Xbox one is a lot better and I will be
getting<00:01:58.210> one<00:01:58.480> around<00:01:58.660> Christmas<00:01:59.050> time<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.440> i

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
getting one around Christmas time so i

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.860 
getting one around Christmas time so i
will<00:01:59.980> do<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> comparison<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:00.940> one<00:02:01.060> but<00:02:01.630> it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
will do a comparison on that one but it

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.480 
will do a comparison on that one but it
just<00:02:02.080> doesn't<00:02:02.230> seem<00:02:02.470> right<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.740> me<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.130> if<00:02:03.250> if

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
just doesn't seem right to me that if if

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.310 
just doesn't seem right to me that if if
you<00:02:03.940> get<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.210> first<00:02:04.450> shot<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.720> someone<00:02:05.140> with<00:02:05.290> a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
you get the first shot on someone with a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.110 
you get the first shot on someone with a
submachine<00:02:05.560> gun<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.190> they<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:06.850> turn<00:02:07.000> around

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
submachine gun and they just turn around

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.460 
submachine gun and they just turn around
and<00:02:07.270> melt<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.600> about<00:02:07.900> doesn't<00:02:08.290> seem

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
and melt you with about doesn't seem

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.740 
and melt you with about doesn't seem
right<00:02:08.680> and<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:08.979> seems<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.430> unfair<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.450> my

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
right and it seems just unfair in my

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.570 
right and it seems just unfair in my
opinion<00:02:10.960> don't<00:02:11.560> wrong<00:02:11.740> it's<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.520> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
opinion don't wrong it's not it's not a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.760 
opinion don't wrong it's not it's not a
bad<00:02:12.880> game<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:14.290> don't<00:02:14.440> think<00:02:14.650> they've

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
bad game I just don't think they've

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.650 
bad game I just don't think they've
balanced<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.400> right<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.000> maps<00:02:16.210> are<00:02:16.480> very

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
balanced it right like the maps are very

balanced it right like the maps are very
very<00:02:16.840> big<00:02:17.080> they're<00:02:17.230> very<00:02:17.440> very<00:02:17.560> very<00:02:18.280> very

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
very big they're very very very very

come back to some extent you can use a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
submachine gun on and I really enjoy

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
submachine gun on and I really enjoy
using<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.880> submachine<00:02:28.150> guns<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.570> think

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
using the submachine guns I think

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.240 
using the submachine guns I think
they're<00:02:29.260> really<00:02:29.410> good<00:02:29.650> my<00:02:29.770> favorite<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.130> buy

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
they're really good my favorite to buy

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.130 
they're really good my favorite to buy
five<00:02:30.460> with<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> 10-6<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.300> ASM<00:02:31.690> what<00:02:31.900> I'll

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
five with a 10-6 in the ASM what I'll

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.710 
five with a 10-6 in the ASM what I'll
probably<00:02:32.470> do<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> video<00:02:33.100> on<00:02:33.550> those<00:02:34.240> very<00:02:34.510> soon

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
probably do a video on those very soon

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.020 
probably do a video on those very soon
but<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.920> doesn't<00:02:36.070> seem<00:02:36.340> fair<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.670> me<00:02:36.820> that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
but it just doesn't seem fair to me that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.160 
but it just doesn't seem fair to me that
the<00:02:37.120> bowel<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.510> turn<00:02:37.690> around<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.020> just

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the bowel can turn around that just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.510 
the bowel can turn around that just
totally<00:02:38.350> melt<00:02:38.770> me<00:02:38.950> when<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.220> using<00:02:39.370> a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
totally melt me when I'm using a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.740 
totally melt me when I'm using a
submachine<00:02:39.940> gun<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.210> just<00:02:40.300> doesn't<00:02:40.630> seem

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
submachine gun it just doesn't seem

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.320 
submachine gun it just doesn't seem
right<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.920> my<00:02:42.100> opinion<00:02:42.340> fair<00:02:42.940> enough<00:02:43.090> if<00:02:43.210> he

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
right in my opinion fair enough if he

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.730 
right in my opinion fair enough if he
was<00:02:43.420> using<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.720> shotgun<00:02:43.930> which<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.440> very<00:02:44.650> very

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
was using a shotgun which is very very

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.870 
was using a shotgun which is very very
on<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> power<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.310> game<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.730> just

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
on the power in this game it just

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.190 
on the power in this game it just
doesn't<00:02:46.030> seem<00:02:46.210> right<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.390> me<00:02:46.510> know<00:02:46.720> that's<00:02:47.050> why

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
doesn't seem right to me know that's why

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.780 
doesn't seem right to me know that's why
I<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.650> slightly<00:02:47.980> unbalanced<00:02:48.580> in<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
I think it is slightly unbalanced in the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.520 
I think it is slightly unbalanced in the
game<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.150> kind<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.570> need<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> fix<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.230> maybe

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
game they kind of need to fix that maybe

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.900 
game they kind of need to fix that maybe
perhaps<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.980> bowel<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> little<00:02:51.520> bit<00:02:51.640> because

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
perhaps the bowel a little bit because

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.490 
perhaps the bowel a little bit because
there<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.240> no<00:02:52.390> recoil<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.110> I've<00:02:53.230> also<00:02:53.380> found

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
there is no recoil and I've also found

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.260 
there is no recoil and I've also found
that<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:54.010> you're<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.340> using<00:02:54.550> toughness<00:02:55.090> on

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
that if you're not using toughness on

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.120 
that if you're not using toughness on
all<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.900> other<00:02:55.990> guns<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.680> shot<00:02:56.890> you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
all the other guns and you get shot you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.180 
all the other guns and you get shot you
get<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> lot<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.760> flinch<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.410> battle<00:02:59.650> 27

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
get a lot of flinch but on the battle 27

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.199 
get a lot of flinch but on the battle 27
if<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.520> look<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.850> you're<00:03:00.940> not<00:03:01.000> using

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
if you look if you're not using

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.880 
if you look if you're not using
toughness<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.780> they<00:03:01.870> see<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.410> don't<00:03:02.650> get<00:03:02.800> as

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
toughness and they see you don't get as

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.320 
toughness and they see you don't get as
much<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.310> really<00:03:03.520> weird<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.850> seems<00:03:04.060> likely

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
much it's really weird it seems likely

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.410 
much it's really weird it seems likely
they<00:03:04.810> focused<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.500> lot<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.040> bow<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.459> not<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
they focused a lot on the bow and not so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.820 
they focused a lot on the bow and not so
much<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.840> other<00:03:07.959> guns<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.380> really

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
much on the other guns it's really

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.960 
much on the other guns it's really
really<00:03:09.160> odd<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> mean<00:03:09.550> some<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.850> other

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.040 
gameplay with an S n6a sm1 IMR I would
class<00:04:12.130> as<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.400> good<00:04:12.580> in<00:04:12.670> play<00:04:12.850> because<00:04:13.210> it's<00:04:13.720> not

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
class as a good in play because it's not

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.789 
class as a good in play because it's not
because<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.250> will<00:04:15.460> probably<00:04:15.670> most<00:04:16.269> likely<00:04:16.799> be

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
because it will probably most likely be

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.650 
because it will probably most likely be
against<00:04:18.100> team<00:04:18.610> using<00:04:18.910> bounce<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.390> in<00:04:19.540> my

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
against team using bounce and in my

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.460 
against team using bounce and in my
opinion<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.989> will<00:04:20.110> be<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.230> much<00:04:20.440> better

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
opinion that will be a much better

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.170 
opinion that will be a much better
gameplay<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:21.160> watch<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.700> it'll<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.150> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
gameplay to watch and it'll just be a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.090 
gameplay to watch and it'll just be a
lot<00:04:22.420> more<00:04:22.480> entertaining<00:04:23.470> gameplay<00:04:23.920> because

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
lot more entertaining gameplay because

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.190 
lot more entertaining gameplay because
they're<00:04:25.060> harder<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.390> use<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.930> guns<00:04:26.110> are

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
they're harder to use the guns are

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.410 
they're harder to use the guns are
harder<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:26.830> my<00:04:27.070> opinion<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.400> bowel<00:04:27.670> isn't

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
harder in my opinion the bowel isn't

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.700 
harder in my opinion the bowel isn't
hard<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> use<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.990> doesn't<00:04:29.200> really<00:04:29.290> take<00:04:29.530> any

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
hard to use it doesn't really take any

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.350 
hard to use it doesn't really take any
skill<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.280> use<00:04:30.310> I'm<00:04:30.640> probably<00:04:30.790> gonna<00:04:30.940> get<00:04:31.120> a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
skill to use I'm probably gonna get a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.970 
skill to use I'm probably gonna get a
little<00:04:31.720> bit<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.960> paper<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.650> really

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
little bit of paper that but it really

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
little bit of paper that but it really
doesn't<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.460> think<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.730> lot<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.910> people

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
doesn't and I think a lot of people

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640 
doesn't and I think a lot of people
would<00:04:34.270> agree<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.510> me<00:04:34.630> in<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.260> fact<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.470> it

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
would agree with me in the fact that it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.290 
would agree with me in the fact that it
doesn't<00:04:35.890> take<00:04:36.040> much<00:04:36.220> skill<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.880> use<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.150> gun

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
doesn't take much skill to use that gun

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.640 
doesn't take much skill to use that gun
I<00:04:37.480> don't<00:04:37.720> know<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:37.810> just<00:04:37.930> think<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:38.380> kind<00:04:38.590> of

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
I don't know I just think it's kind of

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.140 
I don't know I just think it's kind of
unbalanced<00:04:39.220> really<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.520> maps<00:04:39.760> are<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.030> little

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
unbalanced really the maps are a little

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.820 
unbalanced really the maps are a little
bit<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.780> maps<00:04:40.960> are<00:04:41.050> good<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.650> movement

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
bit the maps are good is the movement

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.560 
bit the maps are good is the movement
they<00:04:42.070> need<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.310> be<00:04:42.370> thick<00:04:42.550> but<00:04:42.820> they<00:04:43.420> need<00:04:43.540> to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
they need to be thick but they need to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.040 
they need to be thick but they need to
add<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.840> few<00:04:44.470> smaller<00:04:45.100> maps<00:04:45.660> few<00:04:46.660> more<00:04:46.810> small

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
add a few smaller maps few more small

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.420 
add a few smaller maps few more small
amounts<00:04:47.350> for<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.620> submachine<00:04:47.950> young<00:04:48.190> players

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
amounts for the submachine young players

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.340 
amounts for the submachine young players
and<00:04:48.670> all<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.300> kind<00:04:49.480> of<00:04:49.510> stuff<00:04:49.570> that's<00:04:50.020> really

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
and all that kind of stuff that's really

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.870 
and all that kind of stuff that's really
all<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.650> want<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.950> talk<00:04:51.100> about<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.820> it

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
all I want to talk about it to do is it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.580 
all I want to talk about it to do is it
about<00:04:51.970> being<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.630> slightly<00:04:52.930> unbalanced<00:04:53.530> in

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
about being a slightly unbalanced in

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.660 
about being a slightly unbalanced in
this<00:04:53.680> game<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.860> don't<00:04:54.040> think<00:04:54.070> it's<00:04:54.280> gonna<00:04:54.400> break

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
this game I don't think it's gonna break

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.550 
this game I don't think it's gonna break
the<00:04:54.880> game<00:04:55.000> it's<00:04:55.210> not<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.330> broken<00:04:55.630> game<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:56.440> not

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
the game it's not a broken game it's not

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.440 
the game it's not a broken game it's not
a<00:04:56.620> bad<00:04:56.950> game<00:04:57.250> it's<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.490> very<00:04:57.670> good<00:04:57.700> game<00:04:58.030> it's<00:04:58.390> a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
a bad game it's a very good game it's a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.940 
a bad game it's a very good game it's a
game<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.810> lot<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.110> people<00:04:59.200> do<00:04:59.500> enjoy<00:04:59.800> an

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
game that a lot of people do enjoy an

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.380 
game that a lot of people do enjoy an
old<00:05:00.100> will<00:05:00.250> definitely<00:05:00.760> be<00:05:00.820> playing<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.180> throw

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
old will definitely be playing in throw

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.610 
old will definitely be playing in throw
its<00:05:01.540> life<00:05:01.690> cycle<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.200> definitely<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.590> a

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
its life cycle but it definitely is a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.710 
its life cycle but it definitely is a
good<00:05:02.800> game<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.100> love<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.640> movement<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.150> love<00:05:04.540> how

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
good game I love the movement I love how

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.840 
good game I love the movement I love how
fast<00:05:04.960> pace<00:05:05.170> is<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.340> they<00:05:06.490> do<00:05:06.550> need

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
fast pace is I just think they do need

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.910 
fast pace is I just think they do need
to<00:05:06.880> fix<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.270> bout<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:07.720> patch<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.770> little

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
to fix the bout and patch it a little

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.200 
to fix the bout and patch it a little
bit<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.190> make<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.430> slightly<00:05:09.550> less<00:05:09.790> powerful

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
bit and make it slightly less powerful

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.970 
bit and make it slightly less powerful
than<00:05:10.390> is<00:05:10.600> at<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.810> moment<00:05:10.960> who<00:05:11.500> can<00:05:11.680> drive<00:05:11.800> it

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980
