follows put a one one creature in a play
creatures<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.830> control<00:02:21.860> get<00:02:22.340> +1<00:02:22.700> +1<00:02:22.940> until

creatures you control get +1 +1 until
end<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.780> turn<00:02:24.099> it's<00:02:25.099> almost<00:02:25.459> identical<00:02:26.030> to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
end of turn it's almost identical to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.570 
end of turn it's almost identical to
this<00:02:27.080> card<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.650> only<00:02:27.830> difference<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.250> is

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
this card the only difference here is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.479 
this card the only difference here is
that<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.569> creature<00:02:29.870> tokens<00:02:30.379> have<00:02:30.590> haste<00:02:31.069> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
that the creature tokens have haste and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.479 
that the creature tokens have haste and
the<00:02:32.030> trade-off<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.799> creature<00:02:34.069> token

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
the trade-off because the creature token

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.990 
the trade-off because the creature token
no<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.849> guess<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.269> one's<00:02:36.340> well<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.730> little

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
no I guess this one's well it's a little

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.390 
no I guess this one's well it's a little
bit<00:02:38.090> cheaper<00:02:38.480> labor<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.379> act<00:02:39.560> ability<00:02:40.069> he

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
bit cheaper labor to act ability he

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.339 
bit cheaper labor to act ability he
doesn't<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> top<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.360> boost<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
doesn't get the top but it boost but the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.259 
doesn't get the top but it boost but the
togas<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.890> haste<00:02:43.159> but<00:02:43.700> overall<00:02:43.909> it's<00:02:44.090> doing

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
togas have haste but overall it's doing

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.580 
togas have haste but overall it's doing
the<00:02:44.299> same<00:02:44.390> thing<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:45.019> your<00:02:45.170> creatures<00:02:45.470> are

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the same thing it's your creatures are

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.740 
the same thing it's your creatures are
getting<00:02:45.799> bigger<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.190> you're<00:02:46.340> making<00:02:46.489> them

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
getting bigger and you're making them

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.890 
getting bigger and you're making them
yeah<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.650> again<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:50.120> were<00:02:50.239> talking<00:02:50.599> about<00:02:50.690> the

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
fine as long as you know you thought the

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.990 
fine as long as you know you thought the
White<00:03:53.540> Queen<00:03:53.750> guildmage<00:03:54.410> maybe<00:03:54.709> saw<00:03:54.980> some<00:03:55.760> no

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
White Queen guildmage maybe saw some no

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.360 
White Queen guildmage maybe saw some no
I<00:03:56.359> tried<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.169> squeeze<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.590> into<00:03:57.769> constructed

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
I tried to squeeze that into constructed

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.330 
I tried to squeeze that into constructed
I<00:03:58.730> mean<00:03:58.910> it's<00:03:59.540> powerful<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.260> divx<00:04:00.859> guildmage

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
I mean it's powerful but divx guildmage

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.190 
I mean it's powerful but divx guildmage
with<00:04:01.700> copying<00:04:02.180> spells<00:04:02.480> could<00:04:02.780> be<00:04:02.930> something

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
with copying spells could be something

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.680 
with copying spells could be something
but<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:04.459> one<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.760> think<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:05.269> going<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.480> stick

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
but this one I think it's going to stick

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.750 
but this one I think it's going to stick
and<00:04:05.840> limited<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:06.530> basically<00:04:07.069> if<00:04:07.310> a<00:04:07.400> guildmage

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
and limited but basically if a guildmage

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.339 
and limited but basically if a guildmage
makes<00:04:08.090> creatures<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.599> think<00:04:08.930> we<00:04:09.019> kind<00:04:09.319> of

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
makes creatures I think we kind of

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.650 
makes creatures I think we kind of
accept<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.859> as<00:04:10.010> being<00:04:10.310> worth<00:04:10.549> its<00:04:10.790> weight<00:04:10.940> you
