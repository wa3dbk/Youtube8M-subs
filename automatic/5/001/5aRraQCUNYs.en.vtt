00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
suspicious anyway it looks like it's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.399

standing out from the rest it kind of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.570 
standing out from the rest it kind of
looks<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.950> literally<00:01:11.369> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
looks like they literally just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
looks like they literally just
photoshopped<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:12.659> Niko<00:01:13.229> Bellic

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
photoshopped this off Niko Bellic

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
photoshopped this off Niko Bellic
because<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> hanging<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because the way this is hanging there it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
because the way this is hanging there it
looks<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.320> plastic<00:01:16.619> onto<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
looks like it's just plastic onto the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.149 
looks like it's just plastic onto the
wall<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.360> suits<00:01:18.689> exactly<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.860> Niko
