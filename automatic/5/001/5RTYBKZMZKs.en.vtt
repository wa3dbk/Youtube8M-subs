00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.560
 Then tutorial 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.120
 About how to cut and reinstall headphones 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.400
 I hope you like it 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 the influence: 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.760
 Hello friends, today we do 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.400
 Some magic with headphones. 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.640
 We will look around the center of the cable 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.580
 It is more or less about here 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.140
 If we cut through here, it would not be half 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 Here either 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.800
 But it is the same will be the center of the cable 

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:05.217
 I'll get my scissors 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 I have in my pocket 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.160
 I cut the rope clear 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 It is already cut! 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.800
 I cut some more 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.240
 A little more here and here 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.100
 And a little more here 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.660
 Now, I will try to rebuild the cable 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 I put each headset cable into my hand 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.200
 I will take a little bit of magic from my magic salt 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.220
 Pull the cord slowly 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 The headphones were turned back! 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.800
 Perfect restoration. 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.639
 Very long! 

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:10.212
 educationl programs 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000
 To perform this magic trick 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We need a piece of wire of the same color 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.460
 That the earphone cable 

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:27.944
 The false thumb ("FP") 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.700
 This piece of wire is hiding in the "FP" as well. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.920
 If we moved by hand, it went well to the public 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.860
 The false thumb goes unnoticed 

00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:50.688
 By lifting the phone 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.040
 We take it for half 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.160
 So let's thumb false 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
 Extract the hidden piece of wire 

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.825
 From behind it something is fine 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 Now we can teach our hands clean 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.600
 To make it look do not hide anything 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 Cable pointed several points 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.500
 I say this is not the center 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.220
 In the last movement, the center said 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.660
 Once again we put a false thumb finger 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.260
 We know our hands are fleeting 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.900
 Take our trijeras in the pocket 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
 We deposited in the false thumb pocket 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.080
 She took scissors 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.000
 Cut the loop 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440
 We go several times 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.900
 To get rid of all tests 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.540
 We do our magic passes 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.960
 Or give a touch with a magic wand 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.500
 And the headphones appear to be restored.
