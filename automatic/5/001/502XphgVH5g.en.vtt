that<00:04:19.729> Schumann's<00:04:20.209> residents<00:04:20.810> but<00:04:21.350> they're

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
that Schumann's residents but they're

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.350 
that Schumann's residents but they're
not<00:04:21.650> really<00:04:21.919> related<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.520> ascension<00:04:23.150> process

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
not really related to ascension process

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.420 
not really related to ascension process
so<00:04:23.930> I've<00:04:24.050> left<00:04:24.260> them<00:04:24.440> out<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.280> can

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
so I've left them out and so I can

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.330 
so I've left them out and so I can
concentrate<00:04:25.639> on<00:04:26.419> my<00:04:26.810> next<00:04:27.139> presentation<00:04:27.680> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
concentrate on my next presentation the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.480 
concentrate on my next presentation the
mechanics<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.940> Ascension

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.640

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
out my next one which is called

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.339 
out my next one which is called
mechanics<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.419> Ascension<00:04:40.900> where<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.110> bring

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
mechanics of Ascension where I bring

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.219

everything<00:04:41.710> together<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.990> one<00:04:44.199> I

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
everything together in that one I

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.309 
everything together in that one I
explain<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.889> actual<00:04:45.310> process<00:04:45.550> of

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
explain the actual process of

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.480 
explain the actual process of
physiological<00:04:47.319> change<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.009> can<00:04:48.130> expect

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
physiological change and you can expect

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.760
