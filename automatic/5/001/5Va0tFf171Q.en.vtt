00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
screws around here and here's the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.729 
screws around here and here's the
battery<00:03:41.669> cover<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.139> basically<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.590> can

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
battery cover you can basically you can

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.099 
battery cover you can basically you can
attach<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.639> side<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> II<00:03:45.239> will

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
attach this to the side of the II will

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.819 
attach this to the side of the II will
give<00:03:46.349> up<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:47.190> will<00:03:47.519> give<00:03:47.730> Ibaka<00:03:48.380> ok<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.680> now

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
give up you will give Ibaka ok so now

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.710 
give up you will give Ibaka ok so now
let's<00:03:49.859> switch<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.639> as<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.269> can<00:03:51.389> see<00:03:51.599> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
let's switch it on as you can see the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.980 
let's switch it on as you can see the
switches<00:03:52.200> right<00:03:52.620> here

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
switches right here

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.320 
switches right here
so<00:03:55.680> basically<00:03:56.010> gives<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.490> sound<00:03:56.760> again<00:03:57.300> a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
so basically gives that sound again a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.130 
so basically gives that sound again a
city<00:03:57.720> front<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.530> LED<00:03:58.950> lights<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.780> LED

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
city front the LED lights so the LED

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.760 
city front the LED lights so the LED
lights<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.590> also<00:04:01.830> yellow<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.300> pretty

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
lights is also yellow but it's pretty

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.550 
lights is also yellow but it's pretty
dim<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:06.690> fact<00:04:06.840> also<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.230> LED

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
dim and I think in fact also have LED

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.550 
dim and I think in fact also have LED
light<00:04:07.740> as<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:09.510> pretty<00:04:09.840> awesome<00:04:10.320> and

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
light as can see so pretty awesome and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.980 
light as can see so pretty awesome and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
here's the trigger let's push the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.580 
here's the trigger let's push the
trigger<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:14.970> give<00:04:15.270> me<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.540> hot<00:04:15.750> sound<00:04:15.990> of

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
trigger so you give me the hot sound of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.930 
trigger so you give me the hot sound of
