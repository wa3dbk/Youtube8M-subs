00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 Well, in general , this box gathered pasted 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:16.010
 now it looks like it is still 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.980
 such decorative plastic closes 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.739
 so speaker suspension 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:28.069
 more or less soft wide entrance there 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:32.290
 Fazik pipe a dozen Kohl bent here 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:34.700
 we started did somewhere about here and 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.500
 adding another piece of settings turned out 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:43.489
 previously 29 hertz played rather low played 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.050
 well besides for music well phasic 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.879
 shortened left in equal 35 hertz port 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.929
 of course you could do more but 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.480
 more tube not found and more in 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.749
 food will be harder to shove while general 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.749
 So 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.830
 [music] 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.450
 the dynamics of such a move relatively 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.039
 easy so fast genres are pretty 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.009
 good play drama be good 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:46.539
 plays dub step yesterday here evening trance 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:49.590
 listened too well not expected of course 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.590
 such a cheap speaker such instructions 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.679
 characteristics normal body parameters 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 small for him on the Internet did not find 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.130
 can rocks crooked in general for the money 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:09.190
 instead of buying mr and from better 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:11.940
 advised to take such a set let's say 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.940
 drum 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.740
 [music] 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.730

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 [music] 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.480

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.860
 [music] 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:01.379
 Well, the camera does not record much I think to torment 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:06.480
 meaning no plays nice low for 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:10.439
 dozens pretty softly more 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.159
 of course they love to go up and down 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.060
 dislikes but at low power quite 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.319
 actually turned out pretty 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:30.980
 Musical Subic can drive blacks 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:30.980
 watch the peak let's say the same from we have 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.489
 peak project 20 and 21 herz 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.270
 shakes the door all shakes in front of 7 hertz 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.200
 all the walls goes into resonance and so 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.200
 the pressure of the house is not sickly, everything seems to be
