00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
easy recipe we're gonna start off with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.820

about a pound and a half of him any time

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.860 
about a pound and a half of him any time
that<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.040> have<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> fine<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:48.420> also<00:00:48.600> going

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that you have is fine we're also going

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
that you have is fine we're also going
to<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:49.559> 1/4<00:00:49.860> cup<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.220> chopped<00:00:50.970> white

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to use about 1/4 cup of chopped white

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.070 
to use about 1/4 cup of chopped white
onion<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.870> about<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.309> quarter<00:00:53.550> cup<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:54.080> chopped

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
onion and about a quarter cup of chopped

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.350 
onion and about a quarter cup of chopped
celery<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.190> whenever<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.730> cooking<00:00:57.089> I<00:00:57.180> like

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
celery now whenever I'm cooking I like

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
celery now whenever I'm cooking I like
to<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.750> white<00:00:58.170> onion<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.769> I'm<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.160> gonna

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to use white onion when I'm not gonna

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.479 
to use white onion when I'm not gonna
actually<00:01:00.559> cook<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> onion<00:01:02.100> thoroughly

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
actually cook the onion thoroughly

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
actually cook the onion thoroughly
because<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.970> white<00:01:03.120> onions<00:01:03.480> tend<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.839> be<00:01:03.930> less

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because the white onions tend to be less

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
because the white onions tend to be less
hot<00:01:04.620> and<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:05.970> give<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> much

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
hot and I think they really give a much

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.380 
hot and I think they really give a much
better<00:01:06.480> flavor<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> we're<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> add

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
better flavor so we're also going to add

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.149 
better flavor so we're also going to add
to<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.780> recipe<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> couple<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> boiled<00:01:10.890> eggs
