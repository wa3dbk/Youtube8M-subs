00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.950
 take two all hello here today rented 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.469
 my update for May 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.350
 there is not much there but what has appeared and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.460
 so decided to immediately make a video so 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 perhaps we will start with the unfortunate maternal 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.800
 gigabyte fees which got a lot 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.330
 not sweet 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 478 socket which is already of many kinds 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.239
 shit look like they beat off her 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 the strengthening of the coolers of the radio then on the chipset 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 also from picking and I do not know nibbled 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 thieves using some slots 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.620
 ram nightmare besides waiting 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 and the capacitors are just a processor 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 but however it works is not included 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.300
 here the contact is intact and here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 broken off and so this latch and contacts 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 totally 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.200
 stealth picture gives off skin 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.470
 for these miserable capacitors and and and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 depended on there still by the way hard drive 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.830
 with her 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.409
 I got it was not dead at all 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.869
 spinning was even a cabled dents somehow 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.869
 I did not take it off but you can revive 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 if there is little desire for anyone there 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.240
 will die at all weaned condenser 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.000
 change is not a problem further here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.790
 box again 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.880
 4 hours socket well motherboard here by 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.310
 at least better than this more serious 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.280
 foxconn 4 slots 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 fat memory well, exactly here already 800 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.759
 obviously 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 all similar with tazhke even have that with 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 she has not checked her knowledge yet 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.810
 put in order already shove the issue 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:14.630
 processor was not here was the right 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.300
 beautiful is in general like this 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.880
 such an interesting thing really means everyone 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.049
 is ati radeon this gaming video card 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.019
 past years under the slot and jeep 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.090
 from the old one however there is already ddr2 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.760
 memory and this giga floor 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.120
 this is one of such serious videos under 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.519
 This slot did not know only 5 until brought in 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.030
 the order is that it was all dirty 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.970
 smoky long lay where they will be 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:59.299
 so it is good to understand the beauty 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:02.370
 motherboard he really have to stir up well and 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.680
 the most important thing is this systemic 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.670
 block 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.160
 Again, was bought for 500 re 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.370
 of course were more abruptly but it had 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.590
 just flown a proven so simple 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.769
 not loaded so he was all the whole 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 a whole dusty and already reception order 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.389
 let's see what's inside maternal 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.209
 epox board 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.510
 green PCB immediately clear such 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.920
 home cool motherboards of this company and 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.549
 very rarely by the way bloated kanso 3 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.549
 must be replaced by an epic 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.819
 so this is not a golden processor radiator 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:47.030
 too clean there will be dust clogged in visited 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:52.160
 get together and amd athlon xp 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.040
 pentium 4 level again 2 gigahertz 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.900
 standard cheeky gigabyte here 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.530
 memory 512 1d 206 cardiac seagate 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.980
 baracuda 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.780
 8 gigs again this is common to 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.480
 of those years year as on 5 2005 2 4 well 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.169
 go type writing here white hours was 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.739
 black, I put white in the color of the case 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.530
 vidyuha there is such a cool blue 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.780
 gigabyte ati radeon 900 like with 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.780
 Kohler do not grow light when 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.030
 turn it on there will glow yet 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:39.100
 I will put on the controller 1394 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:42.390
 conceived put the battery dead cycle 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.280
 already replaced now you have windows 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.050
 lush sex is all right 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:53.970
 work up to any problems standard 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:58.450
 all in the 4th shift nobody is cleaned too 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.930
 That such things seem to be all all for now 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:08.560
 update 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:10.830
 so here are all good luck to everyone 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.830
 until
