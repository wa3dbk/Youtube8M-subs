00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
awful and it got even worse when you're

trying<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.680> higher<00:03:58.919> levels<00:03:59.430> when<00:03:59.790> you're

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
trying to do higher levels when you're

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.490 
trying to do higher levels when you're
stacking<00:04:00.150> blocks<00:04:00.540> on<00:04:00.810> top<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.169> each<00:04:01.319> other

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
to guess and just assume that it's up

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.750 
to guess and just assume that it's up
high<00:04:07.109> where<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.859> want<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.190> yeah<00:04:08.489> especially

configuration in order to get the

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.000 
configuration in order to get the
