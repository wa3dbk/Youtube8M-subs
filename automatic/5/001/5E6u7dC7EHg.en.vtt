00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
so I've got a new project here we'll be

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.990 
so I've got a new project here we'll be
showing<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:11.690> how<00:00:11.750> to<00:00:11.809> replace<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:13.400> strut

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.460 
truck i've got another video posted up
and<00:00:23.609> i'll<00:00:23.669> throw<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:24.050> annotate<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.079> link<00:00:25.349> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and i'll throw up annotate a link to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.919 
and i'll throw up annotate a link to
that<00:00:25.500> here's<00:00:26.309> the<00:00:26.429> new<00:00:26.550> struts<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.179> he<00:00:27.660> also

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
that here's the new struts and he also

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.759 
that here's the new struts and he also
got<00:00:28.340> some<00:00:29.340> heavier<00:00:29.609> coil<00:00:29.910> springs<00:00:30.559> because<00:00:31.559> he

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
got some heavier coil springs because he

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.460 
got some heavier coil springs because he
does<00:00:31.919> have<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> ARB<00:00:32.519> bumper<00:00:33.089> and<00:00:33.290> there<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
does have the ARB bumper and there is a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.319 
does have the ARB bumper and there is a
winch<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:35.820> he<00:00:36.089> needs<00:00:36.269> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
winch in there as well so he needs to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
winch in there as well so he needs to
have<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.600> cool<00:00:36.809> springs<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.260> support<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
have your cool springs to support the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.369 
have your cool springs to support the
weight<00:00:38.159> of<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:39.570> front<00:00:39.839> bumper<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> winch

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
weight of that front bumper and winch

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680

wheels<00:01:01.499> off<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> need<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
wheels off now we are going to need to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.950 
wheels off now we are going to need to
loosen<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.850> lower<00:01:06.000> control<00:01:06.330> arms<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.810> drop

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
loosen the lower control arms and drop

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.600 
loosen the lower control arms and drop
them<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.410> way<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.429> we're<00:01:08.580> doing

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
them out of the way so what we're doing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.969 
them out of the way so what we're doing
here<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.300> we're<00:01:09.720> putting<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:10.200> couple<00:01:10.679> of<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here is we're putting a couple of little

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.090 
here is we're putting a couple of little
marks<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:12.090> alignment<00:01:12.390> cams<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.920> when

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
marks on the alignment cams so that when

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850 
marks on the alignment cams so that when
we<00:01:14.330> retighten<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> lower<00:01:15.539> control<00:01:15.899> arm<00:01:16.170> we

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we retighten the lower control arm we

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
we retighten the lower control arm we
can<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> roughly<00:01:18.300> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.539> ballpark<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
can get it roughly in the ballpark of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.130 
can get it roughly in the ballpark of
where<00:01:19.319> it<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.000> safely<00:01:21.780> drive

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
where it was so that we can safely drive

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
where it was so that we can safely drive
the<00:01:22.290> vehicle<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.430> alignment<00:01:23.850> shop<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the vehicle to the alignment shop and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
the vehicle to the alignment shop and
after<00:01:25.320> any<00:01:25.500> suspension<00:01:25.950> modification<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> do

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
after any suspension modification you do

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.960 
after any suspension modification you do
need<00:01:27.149> to<00:01:27.240> take<00:01:27.470> your<00:01:28.470> truck<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
need to take your truck in to have it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.020 
need to take your truck in to have it
realigned<00:01:31.009> after<00:01:32.009> we've<00:01:32.189> made<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> marks<00:01:32.790> on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
realigned after we've made the marks on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
realigned after we've made the marks on
the<00:01:33.090> lower<00:01:33.659> control<00:01:33.990> arm<00:01:34.200> alignment<00:01:34.649> cams<00:01:34.799> we

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the lower control arm alignment cams we

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
the lower control arm alignment cams we
need<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> support<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.540> lower<00:01:36.719> control<00:01:36.960> arm

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
need to support the lower control arm

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
need to support the lower control arm
with<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.219> floor<00:01:38.460> jack<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.969> there<00:01:39.689> are<00:01:39.840> two

tree<00:04:19.639> so<00:04:20.639> this<00:04:20.820> shaft<00:04:21.060> was<00:04:21.299> walking<00:04:21.660> around<00:04:21.750> in

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
tree so this shaft was walking around in

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.420 
tree so this shaft was walking around in
there<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.430> needed<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.789> replace<00:04:24.539> this<00:04:25.430> top

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
there so we needed to replace this top

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.520 
there so we needed to replace this top
hat<00:04:26.639> as<00:04:26.880> well<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.330> one<00:04:28.110> thing<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.349> want<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
hat as well and one thing I want to

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
hat as well and one thing I want to
mention<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.860> can<00:04:28.919> see<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.250> different

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
mention you can see the different

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.909 
mention you can see the different
lengths<00:04:29.759> of<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.910> shock<00:04:30.380> they're<00:04:31.380> supposed<00:04:31.830> to

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
lengths of the shock they're supposed to

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.159 
lengths of the shock they're supposed to
be<00:04:32.009> positive<00:04:32.310> pressure<00:04:32.880> pushing<00:04:33.810> up<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
be positive pressure pushing up on the

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.480 
be positive pressure pushing up on the
shaft<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:35.310> one's<00:04:35.580> fully<00:04:35.789> collapsed<00:04:36.419> and

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
shaft this one's fully collapsed and

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.740 
shaft this one's fully collapsed and
it's<00:04:38.490> been<00:04:38.729> collapsed<00:04:39.150> for<00:04:39.330> more<00:04:39.449> than<00:04:39.599> an

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it's been collapsed for more than an

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.290 
it's been collapsed for more than an
hour<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.349> has<00:04:40.500> not<00:04:40.680> reset<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:42.060> shock

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
hour and it has not reset so this shock

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.719 
hour and it has not reset so this shock
absorbers<00:04:42.780> junk<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:44.099> definitely<00:04:44.340> needed

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
absorbers junk so it definitely needed

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.150 
absorbers junk so it definitely needed
to<00:04:44.789> be<00:04:44.849> replaced
