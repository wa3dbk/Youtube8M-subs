00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
written for the zx80 because it's

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.020 
written for the zx80 because it's

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
now does xat can't display and run

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.349 
now does xat can't display and run
program<00:01:47.990> code<00:01:48.409> or<00:01:48.799> receive<00:01:49.579> any<00:01:49.729> kind<00:01:50.149> of

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
input whilst displaying something on the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.899 
input whilst displaying something on the
screen<00:01:53.420> did<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.840> think<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:54.890> doesn't<00:01:55.219> move<00:01:55.579> my

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
screen did I think I doesn't move my

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.209 
screen did I think I doesn't move my
sentence<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:56.659> yes<00:01:57.020> if<00:01:57.229> anything<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.009> is

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
sentence there yes if anything at all is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.459 
sentence there yes if anything at all is
going<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:58.819> can't<00:01:59.090> display<00:02:00.700> does<00:02:01.700> NX<00:02:02.060> 81<00:02:02.659> tan

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
going on it can't display does NX 81 tan

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.850 
going on it can't display does NX 81 tan
so<00:02:04.459> I<00:02:04.489> think<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:04.969> actually<00:02:05.450> zx80<00:02:06.110> game

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
so I think this is actually zx80 game

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.110 
so I think this is actually zx80 game
code<00:02:09.250> what's<00:02:10.250> going<00:02:10.549> on<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.819> our<00:02:10.970> dope<00:02:13.120> mmm

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
code what's going on in our dope mmm

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.920 
code what's going on in our dope mmm

you've got to do is get through the big
shower<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:25.450> crap<00:02:27.970> without<00:02:28.970> running<00:02:29.390> into<00:02:29.599> it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
shower of crap without running into it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.400 
shower of crap without running into it
and<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.220> points<00:02:31.430> for<00:02:31.819> every<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.959> don't

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
and you get points for every I don't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.699 
and you get points for every I don't
know<00:02:33.620> chunk<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.670> distance<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.200> get

through without running into something
and<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.329> like<00:02:39.130> 55<00:02:40.130> collisions<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.060> then

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
and you get like 55 collisions and then

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.390 
and you get like 55 collisions and then
it's<00:02:41.420> time<00:02:41.750> up<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.739> tells<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.099> how<00:02:43.160> far

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
list yeah there is your program code 1k

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.270 
list yeah there is your program code 1k
for<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.030> game

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

peek<00:03:51.709> no<00:03:52.709> pokes<00:03:53.069> but<00:03:53.370> there's<00:03:53.520> some<00:03:53.640> Peaks

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
peek no pokes but there's some Peaks

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.580 
peek no pokes but there's some Peaks
there<00:03:54.270> where<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.600> peaks<00:03:54.870> at<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.140> memory

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
there where it peaks at a memory

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.740 
there where it peaks at a memory
location<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.850> understand<00:03:57.510> how<00:03:57.630> that

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
location I don't understand how that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.250 
location I don't understand how that
works<00:03:58.260> I've<00:03:59.100> never<00:04:00.030> understood<00:04:00.180> pecan<00:04:00.810> pokers

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
works I've never understood pecan pokers

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.830 
works I've never understood pecan pokers
well<00:04:01.620> beyond<00:04:01.950> my<00:04:05.630> knowledge<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.540> rest<00:04:09.690> of

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
well beyond my knowledge but the rest of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.690 
well beyond my knowledge but the rest of
it<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.050> just<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.380> few<00:04:10.560> variables<00:04:10.980> here<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.580> the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
it is just a few variables here and the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.360 
it is just a few variables here and the
error<00:04:12.470> because<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:13.680> if<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.069> then<00:04:14.220> but<00:04:14.340> I

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
error because then if and then but I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.420 
error because then if and then but I
can't<00:04:14.640> see<00:04:14.910> any<00:04:15.060> if<00:04:15.239> some<00:04:15.510> bends<00:04:15.829> I'm<00:04:16.829> going<00:04:17.340> to

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
can't see any if some bends I'm going to

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.930 
can't see any if some bends I'm going to
go<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:18.540> type<00:04:19.340> things<00:04:20.340> they're<00:04:20.730> very

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
go on if then type things they're very

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.270 
go on if then type things they're very
slow<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.480> kind<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.870> rubbish<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.530> programming

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
slow and kind of rubbish in programming

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.130 
slow and kind of rubbish in programming
terms<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.850> they're<00:04:24.120> easy<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.840> useless

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
terms but they're easy for a useless

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.290 
terms but they're easy for a useless
coda<00:04:25.620> like<00:04:25.919> me<00:04:26.130> because<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.520> just<00:04:26.640> can't

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
coda like me because I just can't

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.130 
coda like me because I just can't
program<00:04:27.860> yeah<00:04:28.860> ok<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.000> meteors<00:04:30.810> on

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
program yeah ok so that is meteors on

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.370 
program yeah ok so that is meteors on
the<00:04:31.290> zx81<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.580> should<00:04:33.480> try<00:04:33.690> loading<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.200> onto

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
the zx81 I should try loading it onto

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.409 
the zx81 I should try loading it onto
the<00:04:34.530> vedic<00:04:34.950> lady<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.400> have<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.760> feeling<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.270> would

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
the vedic lady I have a feeling it would

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.710 
the vedic lady I have a feeling it would
work<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:40.710> doesn't<00:04:41.130> make<00:04:41.340> make<00:04:41.700> it<00:04:41.910> good<00:04:42.210> mind

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
work that doesn't make make it good mind

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:54.879 
work that doesn't make make it good mind
you<00:04:43.850> ok<00:04:44.850> thank<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.419> for<00:04:45.540> watching

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889
