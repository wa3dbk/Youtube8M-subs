notes it's a fair nerf hey it's pretty

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.950 
notes it's a fair nerf hey it's pretty
fair<00:05:22.510> because<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.140> was<00:05:23.910> really<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:24.940> real<00:05:25.630> real

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
fair because it was really a real real

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.770 
fair because it was really a real real
good<00:05:26.290> weapon<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:27.460> FAL<00:05:27.910> with<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.180> slight<00:05:28.540> fire

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
good weapon the FAL with a slight fire

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.760 
good weapon the FAL with a slight fire
and<00:05:29.440> now<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:30.460> increased<00:05:31.210> recoil<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:32.620> can

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
and now it's increased recoil you can

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.180 
and now it's increased recoil you can
really<00:05:32.920> notice<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.460> but<00:05:33.610> it's<00:05:34.919> it's<00:05:35.919> just<00:05:36.070> a

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
really notice it but it's it's just a

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.770 
really notice it but it's it's just a
lot<00:05:36.340> of<00:05:36.430> fun<00:05:36.580> especially<00:05:36.730> in<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.210> long<00:05:37.390> ranges

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
lot of fun especially in the long ranges

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.290 
lot of fun especially in the long ranges
as<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.050> can<00:05:38.169> see<00:05:38.320> i<00:05:38.350> have<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.800> i<00:05:39.040> had<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.970> burst

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
as you can see i have to i had to burst

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.680 
as you can see i have to i had to burst
a<00:05:40.450> little<00:05:40.660> bit<00:05:41.669> but<00:05:42.669> on<00:05:42.820> a<00:05:42.850> close-range<00:05:43.360> it

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
a little bit but on a close-range it

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.540 
a little bit but on a close-range it
doesn't<00:05:44.169> really<00:05:44.260> matter<00:05:44.470> it's<00:05:45.070> still<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.400> lot

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
doesn't really matter it's still a lot

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.340 
doesn't really matter it's still a lot
of<00:05:45.580> fun<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.870> my<00:05:46.990> conclusion<00:05:47.169> is<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:50.050> fair

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
of fun so my conclusion is it's a fair

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.440 
of fun so my conclusion is it's a fair
nerf<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:51.070> it's<00:05:51.460> going<00:05:51.640> to<00:05:51.730> still<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> lot<00:05:52.419> of

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
nerf and it's going to still a lot of

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.080
