sunburned<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> stuff<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.550> why<00:00:32.790> i

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sunburned and stuff but that's why i

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.220 
sunburned and stuff but that's why i
haven't<00:00:33.300> been<00:00:33.480> able<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> put<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.079> until

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
haven't been able to put this out until

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
haven't been able to put this out until
now<00:00:34.620> which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.130> why<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.610> quite<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> while<00:00:36.149> from

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
now which is why it's quite a while from

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.700 
now which is why it's quite a while from
when<00:00:36.540> i<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.989> 3,000<00:00:37.559> subscribers

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when i actually got 3,000 subscribers

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.700 
when i actually got 3,000 subscribers
and<00:00:38.780> but<00:00:39.780> yeah<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.680> first

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and but yeah this is actually my first

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.670 
and but yeah this is actually my first
game<00:00:41.190> after<00:00:41.790> getting<00:00:42.210> 3000<00:00:42.930> subscribers<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.649> i

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
game after getting 3000 subscribers so i

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.610 
game after getting 3000 subscribers so i
thought<00:00:43.890> i<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.219> pretty<00:00:44.489> cool<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
thought i was actually pretty cool and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.779 
thought i was actually pretty cool and
i'm<00:00:46.620> probably<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.950> add<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.399> couple<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
i'm probably gonna add in a couple of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
i'm probably gonna add in a couple of
fail<00:00:48.239> clips<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> end<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.590> summin<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:51.440> it's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
fail clips at the end or summin and it's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
fail clips at the end or summin and it's
actually<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.129> game<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.969> can't

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
just i'll make a video when it is i'm

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
just i'll make a video when it is i'm
not<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.659> sure<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
not really sure what time it will be it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.359 
not really sure what time it will be it
would<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.939> night<00:01:12.510> time<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
would be like night time my time so that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
would be like night time my time so that
people<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.060> different<00:01:15.600> time<00:01:15.750> zones<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.259> get

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
people from different time zones can get

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
people from different time zones can get
here<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.340> i<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:18.509> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
here because i know that if you're in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
here because i know that if you're in
America<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:19.710> early<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
America and I do at some early time you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.270 
America and I do at some early time you
probably<00:01:20.700> won't<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.939> able<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
probably won't be able to get there and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
probably won't be able to get there and
so<00:01:23.280> i'll<00:01:23.460> probably<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:23.970> around<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.780> don't

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so i'll probably do it around I don't

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.030 
so i'll probably do it around I don't
know<00:01:25.500> about<00:01:25.619> 8<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.280> 9<00:01:26.549> p.m.<00:01:27.090> gmt<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
know about 8 or 9 p.m. gmt so that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.260 
know about 8 or 9 p.m. gmt so that
everyone<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> once<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:32.270> what

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

massive<00:01:53.130> fail<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:53.820> sleep<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.329> get

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
massive fail with the no sleep and I get

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
massive fail with the no sleep and I get
quite<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:56.040> fail<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.549> whole<00:01:56.579> way

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
quite a bit of fail the whole way

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.889 
quite a bit of fail the whole way
through<00:01:57.149> pretty<00:01:57.360> much<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.189> i<00:01:59.659> actually<00:02:00.659> had

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
through pretty much and i actually had

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.480 
through pretty much and i actually had
deep<00:02:01.079> impact<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> no<00:02:01.979> sleep<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.430> well

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
deep impact on for the no sleep as well

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.690 
deep impact on for the no sleep as well
which<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> makes<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> even<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.600> stupid<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
which it makes it even more stupid and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
which it makes it even more stupid and
if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.909> look<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.600> far<00:02:06.899> away<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
if you look how far away is with the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
if you look how far away is with the
deep<00:02:07.920> impact<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.489> stupid<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:10.140> really

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
deep impact on stupid and I'm really

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
deep impact on stupid and I'm really
going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.920> modern<00:02:11.220> warfare<00:02:11.370> two
