00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
it's been out for forever so I think

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.530 
it's been out for forever so I think
that<00:02:51.769> did<00:02:51.980> kind<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.340> lessen<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.730> love<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.420> word

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that did kind of lessen my love for word

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.790 
that did kind of lessen my love for word
because<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.989> kinda<00:02:54.230> already<00:02:54.350> knew<00:02:54.590> what<00:02:54.739> was

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
because I kinda already knew what was

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800 
because I kinda already knew what was
gonna<00:02:54.950> happen<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.819> didn't<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.510> sob

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
gonna happen so I didn't like sob
