00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.539
 Hello come on new free app flew 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.970
 Do you give this old saying every technique is only as good as human 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.559
 who serves them 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.789
 as a matter of fact 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:13.949
 I'm here 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.119
 in the rabbit hutch 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 why not so unexpected 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 Both are my own fault if I do not return my wife 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.019
 because they have new in there again 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.819
 appreciate this message 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.800
 and why 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.380
 I have over four operations shut off OK 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.580
 Dirk comb or turn 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.460
 the trains separated by gender 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 nothing could have happened there 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.190
 But as I said the LED technology is only as good as the human being is served 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 he once demanded the red not quite so made 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350
 the whole shit confused 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.790
 it was green again 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.320
 one night was enough 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.580
 I hope he's the boys today 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.580
 can sort because not so easy 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.890
 and now the salad 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 I do not overestimate this time of not having to be so cheap 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 many find BG Marburg Open the dilemma 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 the Bremen wiggled man found I want to have these great skills here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.400
 Children still could not believe in the promotion 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 should 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.460
 It's getting critical 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 as always about this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 Nothing can happen to testing the new one, which has built me ​​in steel » 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.750
 their 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 Euro builds up its first points 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 losing under the ca stada seems to be spreading 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.220
 now has the hunt 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.350
 in the corner 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 built between it 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 Looking to see how pieces moved stressed 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 very carefully 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 there are 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 Walshe 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 and black ones 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.669
 but how many now 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.549
 that will be 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.969
 the 1 1 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.969
 he was there 4 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.399
 6 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 but it is sufficient 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.169
 I do not want to disturb you anymore 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.369
 so can give his 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.829
 So if you're seventh behind me 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.610
 With that she suddenly realized what love was like for her as a jogger 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:42.649
 World are 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.139
 It is hardly possible to multiply 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.329
 there is not the only problem anymore 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.199
 who would have liked to have you? 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.969
 but not had 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.620
 I'm sure there was a mishap that was a mistake 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.649
 just have to do it through media 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.649
 the Hungarians were the New Jersey Devils 3 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:02.820
 four months leads 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.989
 whether the show is ready for slaughter 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.209
 but goes on 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.629
 that is not the only problem 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.629
 at the hears all the two ends brooding 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.509
 I was last at Zelda 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.500
 many under 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.700
 but it is time to end it proclaimed and were in the enclosure occupy 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.739
 there must probably be dependent on title Lundmark 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.819
 So as I said both ends good 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.079
 at least one seat on it again 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.189
 Runde simply does not have the heart to steal the Windy one 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.919
 but somehow so over the place everything multiplies like 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.329
 weigh heavily 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.329
 This can not continue like that 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.429
 This technique is only as good as the person you love 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.459
 Who wants more of Schramma around 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.149
 So blonde just wanted to solve 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 What's new is precisely the know-how Do you Do catch on 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.199
 See you
