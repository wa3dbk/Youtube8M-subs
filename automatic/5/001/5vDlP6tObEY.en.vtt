00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.750
 that's what it looks like a semblant 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.930
 of exact toilet it is in the process of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.960
 live between nice and his feathers a good 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.789
 and not very fan of the bath by cons 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.529
 can it but qd and one to two times per 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.970
 week maybe more when he does 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.130
 hot and then behind you have to do 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.390
 watch out when it's wet do not 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.069
 have draft do not have any 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.140
 cold so it's rather the beautiful season 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.149
 we sprayed him above him and 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.530
 it falls on him in fine rain and that they 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.450
 like and like perrin after the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 remains this behavior there it will smooth 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.340
 one by one the feathers and put in 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.340
 order 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.410
 what does it eat a gris du gabon 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.580
 more and more we are headed as for 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.260
 the dog or cat to food 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.960
 extruded which are complete feeds 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 who will avoid sorting and wasting 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.940
 and we supplement these foods extruded with 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.320
 the seed mixes the parrot 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.300
 nicely shine we answer all these 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.620
 nutritional needs and we do not have 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.090
 wasted thing that is less the case 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
 with seeds then to move towards 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.350
 the richest seeds that in excess 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.329
 are not very good and it's a big 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.100
 eater you have to bring him free 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.390
 serving a quantity of a bowl 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.950
 and then he will go to use everything at 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.539
 the day must be renewed 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 food every day so that's it 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.359
 who will regulate his needs in 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.039
 food 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.569
 do we have to put the food back 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.710
 every morning there is no time 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.689
 specific what needs to be renewed 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.219
 every day that even when we use 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.659
 a mixture of seeds even if there are any left 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.639
 very often it is the cause of the strike 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.679
 I saw that he was sorting when he 

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.079
 eat he rejects things that's it 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.219
 rejects a lot and he really takes 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.899
 that the best of the best but even 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.819
 in the cup it remains that the causes 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.530
 that you have to renew every day and 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.299
 on an extruded food like this one brings 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.130
 always a fresh food so 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.049
 regular so after we evaluate with the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.490
 time the amount he needs and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.770
 so before handing over food 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.779
 invaded to clean every cup she's 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.979
 same for the water quite it takes 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:53.979
 disinfect with a neutral product 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.210
 there I see oranges bananas apples zagoli 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.920
 corn and all the list you come 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.570
 to list are fruits of vegetables 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.369
 they appreciate he loves 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.750
 especially the apple after that is to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.970
 distribute daily basis 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.950
 just wash them a preferable 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.870
 to have untreated products this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.520
 something we bring to vary 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.050
 food and to compensate for 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.970
 possible deficiencies that a mixture of 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.319
 standard seeds and you said 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 actually it's the hand towards states 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.440
 family members and same time 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.910
 when you go shopping you have to think 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 to his parrot when we're going to do his 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.060
 races or cafes always have some 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.060
 fruits and vegetables to sadism
