00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
as you guys can see from the top left

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.060 
as you guys can see from the top left
they<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.260> bringing<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.529> different<00:00:16.830> coloured

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
they are bringing a different coloured

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.170 
they are bringing a different coloured
woods<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.580> means<00:00:17.820> they're<00:00:18.029> probably

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
woods which means they're probably

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
woods which means they're probably
messing<00:00:18.869> around<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.260> textures<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.609> might

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
messing around with textures so we might

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
messing around with textures so we might
be<00:00:20.910> able<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.330> some<00:00:21.539> texture<00:00:21.900> packs<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
be able to see some texture packs in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
be able to see some texture packs in the
near<00:00:22.590> future<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> was<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> betting<00:00:24.060> man<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
near future now if I was a betting man I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.439 
near future now if I was a betting man I
would<00:00:24.600> probably<00:00:24.900> say<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.970> they<00:00:26.970> might<00:00:27.300> be

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
would probably say that they might be

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.640 
would probably say that they might be
bringing<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> more<00:00:28.470> popular

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
bringing some of the more popular

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
bringing some of the more popular
texture<00:00:29.490> packs<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.880> hoping<00:00:30.210> something<00:00:30.449> like

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
texture packs I'm hoping something like

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.600 
texture packs I'm hoping something like
Yogscast<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> guys<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.219> some

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
Yogscast fans out there also dokucraft
that<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.059> personal<00:00:36.329> favorite<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that is my personal favorite and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
that is my personal favorite and
hopefully<00:00:37.500> some<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> realism<00:00:38.700> texture

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
hopefully some of the realism texture

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350 
hopefully some of the realism texture
packs<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.690> well<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:42.030> that's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
packs as well but you know that that's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000 
packs as well but you know that that's
just<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.660> guess<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
just a guess you know because as you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.290 
just a guess you know because as you
guys<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> bottom<00:00:45.120> left

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
guys can see from the bottom left

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
guys can see from the bottom left
picture<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:45.899> change<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> color<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
picture they also change the color of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
picture they also change the color of
the<00:00:47.730> gravel<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> texture<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the gravel will the texture of the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770 
the gravel will the texture of the
gravel<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.010> they're<00:00:50.730> definitely<00:00:50.879> max<00:00:51.239> messing

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
gravel so they're definitely max messing

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.180 
gravel so they're definitely max messing
around<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.230> texture<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.860> hopefully

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
around with the texture so hopefully

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
around with the texture so hopefully
we'll<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.520> able<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.300> texture<00:00:54.629> pack

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we'll be able to see some texture pack

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
we'll be able to see some texture pack
soon<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.190> title

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
soon I don't think they will be in title

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
soon I don't think they will be in title
update<00:00:56.699> 9<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.840> maybe<00:00:58.050> around<00:00:58.559> title<00:00:59.010> update

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939 
update 9 but maybe around title update
10<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.840> definitely<00:01:01.050> messing<00:01:01.440> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
10 but they are definitely messing with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
10 but they are definitely messing with
it<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.399> hopefully<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.329> some<00:01:03.780> sometime

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it so hopefully we see some sometime

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830 
it so hopefully we see some sometime
soon<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.360> top<00:01:06.540> left<00:01:06.750> picture

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
block which shows a map so I think

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
exactly what that is called but it's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.319 
exactly what that is called but it's
holding<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> clock<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> furnace

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
holding the clock but in the furnace

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.630 
holding the clock but in the furnace
there<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> netherrack<00:01:40.110> being<00:01:40.500> SH<00:01:40.530> melted<00:01:41.250> into

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there is netherrack being SH melted into

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.660 
there is netherrack being SH melted into
what<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> assume<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> nether<00:01:43.500> brick<00:01:43.770> ingots<00:01:44.369> or

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
what I assume is nether brick ingots or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.719 
what I assume is nether brick ingots or
neither<00:01:45.240> ingots<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.110> another<00:01:46.979> breaking<00:01:47.549> guts

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
neither ingots or another breaking guts

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370 
neither ingots or another breaking guts
I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> name<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I don't really know what the name of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
I don't really know what the name of
those<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> name<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> those<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.540> but

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
those is what the name of those are but

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.590 
those is what the name of those are but
yeah<00:01:52.979> hopefully<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.790> craft<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.360> nether

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
yeah hopefully we can craft some nether

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
yeah hopefully we can craft some nether
brick<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> said<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> happen<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.070> find<00:01:56.280> another

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
brick and said I happen to find another

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
brick and said I happen to find another
fortress<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:57.420> that'd<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> pretty<00:01:57.930> cool

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
fortress I think that'd be pretty cool

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.950 
fortress I think that'd be pretty cool
but<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> bottom<00:01:59.340> left<00:01:59.520> again<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.659> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
wool kind of does look a bit suspicious

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760
