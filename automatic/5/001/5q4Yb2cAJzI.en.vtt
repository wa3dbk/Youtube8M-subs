00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 which you definitely in the bank press 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.769
 help to get a better performance 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.130
 of course, injury free 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 harder to train better 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.980
 can and indeed we need the saw 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.570
 the law must be good in any case 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.490
 work because we feel the tension 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740

 there we have to be able to move well 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.730
 the muscles must be able to work well 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.129

 Of course we still have the breast of the mountain 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 we have the back firmly the ass is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.170
