he touched my camera and said no
recording<00:03:44.110> right<00:03:44.230> now<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:44.769> he<00:03:45.580> completely

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
recording right now so he completely

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.699 
recording right now so he completely
denied<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.630> there<00:03:46.750> was<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.930> big<00:03:47.080> black<00:03:47.319> smoke
