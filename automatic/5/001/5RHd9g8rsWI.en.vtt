00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.219
 good day my lie yes I'm doing now 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.500
 a small studio for a breakfast in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 Lately, almost always so 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.710
 and I think it's really delicious 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.510
 and is called there and I believe 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.800
 we can scotch it out somewhere 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.029
 the corner and yes the recipe of simon vom 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 be converted 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.520
 the video he explains that how to do that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.940
 because I think I'm in the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.120
 infobox 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 and then stood with the ingredients 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.530
 First we do not need any 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.520
 So at least I oatmeal myself 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.610
 mean 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.220
 then we still need poor syrup oats 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 with banana and a little bit hidden 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.030
 like a head and then we have everything 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.519
 together can even start right 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.650
 We will do the cooking first 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.030
 the banana up and then take us 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 our forks come out on and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.950
 crush a banana flop to be 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.510
 Then we distribute the banana a job 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 so that the nice surfaces again 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.070
 covered 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.400
 and then just the fine comes 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.840
 oatmeal that oatmeal 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.520
 that's about the banana fritters too 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.490
 Do not all hope to drive because it should 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.380
 yes also fill you then just the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.360
 Oat milk also adds a lot 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.340
 because that must be really nice in it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.960
 swim so that works fine yes 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.399
 and if you want you can still so beautiful 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 maple syrup and to give 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.630
 and then stir stirring 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.630
 stir and again 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 and then the result we pour as 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.939
 also our gun cup or something 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.579
