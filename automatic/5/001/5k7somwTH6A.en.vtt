00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
a pain and you'll probably forget about

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.020 
a pain and you'll probably forget about
it<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.099> was<00:03:22.310> stuff<00:03:22.489> will<00:03:22.670> just<00:03:22.700> be

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it and that was stuff will just be
