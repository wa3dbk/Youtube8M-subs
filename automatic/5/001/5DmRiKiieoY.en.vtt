I've been working on this is a board

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.789 
I've been working on this is a board

who<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.790> create<00:00:12.980> playable<00:00:13.980> mock-ups<00:00:14.519> of

who want to create playable mock-ups of

who want to create playable mock-ups of
board<00:00:15.960> games<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:17.130> when<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> say<00:00:17.580> board<00:00:17.850> games<00:00:18.060> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
board games and when I say board games I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.720 
board games and when I say board games I
mean<00:00:18.359> physical<00:00:18.869> board<00:00:19.109> games<00:00:19.380> not

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
mean physical board games not

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.480 
mean physical board games not
computerized<00:00:20.730> board<00:00:20.970> games<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> idea<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
computerized board games so the idea of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.470 
computerized board games so the idea of
this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.930> emulate<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:26.000> actual<00:00:27.000> physical

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this is to emulate an actual physical

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
this is to emulate an actual physical
environment<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.410> might<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.740> able<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
environment that you might be able to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.849 
environment that you might be able to
play<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> board<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.960> sort<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.619> in

play a board game in it's sort of in
part<00:00:32.160> loosely<00:00:32.610> inspired<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:34.670> desperate

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
part loosely inspired by desperate

part loosely inspired by desperate
guards<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.540> wolf<00:00:36.750> fire<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> gate<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
guards from wolf fire the gate with the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.020 
guards from wolf fire the gate with the
it's<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.190> engine<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> doesn't<00:00:42.090> do

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
it's not a game engine so it doesn't do

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's not a game engine so it doesn't do
rules<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.270> doesn't<00:00:45.300> enforce<00:00:45.809> rules<00:00:46.050> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
rules it doesn't enforce rules it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.880 
rules it doesn't enforce rules it's
purely<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.070> physics<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.180> objects<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
purely just physics and objects and and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
purely just physics and objects and and
so<00:00:50.879> forth<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> idea<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> anybody

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so forth and the idea is that anybody

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670 
so forth and the idea is that anybody
even<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.579> no<00:00:53.850> coding<00:00:54.719> experience<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.530> just

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
even with no coding experience can just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.000 
even with no coding experience can just
take<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> unity<00:00:56.430> editor<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.680> create<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> board

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
take the unity editor and create a board

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.840 
take the unity editor and create a board
game<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.430> it<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> couple<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> features<00:01:02.370> for

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
game in it so a couple of features for

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.140 
game in it so a couple of features for
you<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> show<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.600> I've<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:05.150> objects

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you and show you what I've got objects

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.289 
you and show you what I've got objects
in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> game<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:08.299> defined<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:10.850> tags<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
in the game are defined by tags and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
in the game are defined by tags and
different<00:01:13.290> tags<00:01:13.590> assign<00:01:14.070> different

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
different tags assign different

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
different tags assign different
behaviors<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:18.650> do<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:19.799> items<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.460> I'll

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
behaviors to do these items so I'll

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
behaviors to do these items so I'll
actually<00:01:21.060> start<00:01:21.740> by<00:01:22.740> adding<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.159> few<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
actually start by adding a few things to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
actually start by adding a few things to
the<00:01:23.939> scene<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:25.729> see<00:01:26.729> maybe<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.970> should<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.360> by

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the scene I see maybe I should start by

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
the scene I see maybe I should start by
removing<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.020> few<00:01:28.229> things<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> scene<00:01:29.040> we

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
removing a few things from the scene we

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
removing a few things from the scene we
don't<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:32.299> okay<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> red<00:01:35.729> die<00:01:36.450> I'll

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
don't need that okay so the red die I'll

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.350 
don't need that okay so the red die I'll
add<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.880> hat<00:01:39.530> now<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> Hat<00:01:41.090> doesn't<00:01:42.090> do

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
add and this hat now the Hat doesn't do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
add and this hat now the Hat doesn't do
anything<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.320> haven't<00:01:43.470> assigned<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
anything because we haven't assigned a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
anything because we haven't assigned a
tag<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> tag<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.600> as

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
tag to it so I'm going to tag this as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.789 
tag to it so I'm going to tag this as
game<00:01:46.350> piece<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.369> you'll<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:49.110> red

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
game piece and you'll see that the red

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.389 
game piece and you'll see that the red
die<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.369> tagged<00:01:50.939> dice<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:52.200> shall<00:01:52.380> check<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
die is tagged dice we shall check it so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.039 
die is tagged dice we shall check it so
these<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:53.759> items<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.360> tagged<00:01:54.600> differently

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
these two items are tagged differently

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359 
these two items are tagged differently
so<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> behavior<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.770> slightly<00:01:56.070> different

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so the behavior is slightly different

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.200 
so the behavior is slightly different
let<00:01:56.880> me<00:01:56.969> show<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:58.710> game<00:01:59.250> piece<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> Hat<00:02:00.000> if

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
let me show you a game piece the Hat if

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
let me show you a game piece the Hat if
I<00:02:00.299> pick<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.829> picks<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I pick it up and just picks it up and I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.289 
I pick it up and just picks it up and I
can<00:02:02.700> drop<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
can drop it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
can drop it
pick<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.719> drop<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.899> dice<00:02:06.899> book<00:02:07.170> differently

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
pick up drop the dice book differently

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559 
pick up drop the dice book differently
pick<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.729> does<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.239> fling

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
pick it up and it does a little fling

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.290 
pick it up and it does a little fling
into<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> air

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.780 

another<00:02:14.300> thing<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.980> pick<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.610> game

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
another thing is that you pick up a game

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.780 
another thing is that you pick up a game
piece<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.300> rotates<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:17.990> upright<00:02:18.350> position

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
piece it rotates to the upright position

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.690 
piece it rotates to the upright position
another<00:02:20.330> tagged<00:02:20.630> item<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.170> cards<00:02:21.680> now<00:02:21.950> cards

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
another tagged item of cards now cards

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.810 
another tagged item of cards now cards

the<00:02:26.060> upright<00:02:26.360> position<00:02:26.570> if<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.170> pick<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.470> up

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
the upright position if you pick it up

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.300 
the upright position if you pick it up
I'll<00:02:29.600> also<00:02:29.960> eventually<00:02:30.200> want<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.590> add<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
I'll also eventually want to add to the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.280 
I'll also eventually want to add to the
ability<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.880> take<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> pick<00:02:32.600> up<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.810> card<00:02:33.110> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
ability to take a pick up a card and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
ability to take a pick up a card and
rotate<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.830> any<00:02:34.250> way<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.490> want<00:02:34.690> any<00:02:35.690> direction

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
rotate it any way you want any direction

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.130 
rotate it any way you want any direction
and<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.180> know<00:02:38.270> flip<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:38.960> down<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
and you know flip it up or down just to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.510 
and you know flip it up or down just to
show<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.740> tags<00:02:43.040> are<00:02:43.280> indeed

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
show you that the tags are indeed

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.590 
show you that the tags are indeed
flexible<00:02:44.180> if<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:44.660> game<00:02:44.960> piece<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.600> retag

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
flexible if I take game piece and retag

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.550 
flexible if I take game piece and retag
it<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:48.050> dice<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.380> does

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
it to be dice you can see then it does

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.800 
it to be dice you can see then it does
that<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:56.300> guess<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.900> rest<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.620> just

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
that and I guess the rest of it is just

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.750 
that and I guess the rest of it is just
cosmetic<00:02:59.810> anybody<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.470> anybody<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.610> make<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
cosmetic anybody can anybody can make a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.950 
cosmetic anybody can anybody can make a
game<00:03:02.030> here<00:03:02.300> I'll<00:03:02.450> show<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.660> what<00:03:02.750> I've<00:03:02.930> done

game here I'll show you what I've done

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.320 
game here I'll show you what I've done
earlier<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.990> flat<00:03:06.140> plain<00:03:06.590> with

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
earlier this is just a flat plain with

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.110 
earlier this is just a flat plain with
texture<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:12.550> just<00:03:13.550> get<00:03:13.790> rid<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
texture on it and just get rid of the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.090 
Hat we don't need that don't need the
card<00:03:17.390> because<00:03:17.630> snakes<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.290> ladders<00:03:18.410> does<00:03:18.890> not

card because snakes and ladders does not
have<00:03:19.430> cards<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.530> made<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.890> hotkey<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.640> spawn

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
have cards and I made a hotkey to spawn

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.340 
have cards and I made a hotkey to spawn
some<00:03:23.300> generic<00:03:24.610> game<00:03:25.610> pieces<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.480> yeah<00:03:27.050> now

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
some generic game pieces and yeah now

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.770 
some generic game pieces and yeah now
you<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.650> play<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:29.030> eventually<00:03:29.630> maybe

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
you can play it and eventually maybe

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.160 
you can play it and eventually maybe
I'll<00:03:29.959> add<00:03:31.030> multiplayer<00:03:32.030> support<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.959> you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
I'll add multiplayer support so that you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.920 
I'll add multiplayer support so that you
can<00:03:34.390> test<00:03:35.390> play<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:35.989> game<00:03:37.120> with<00:03:38.120> people

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
can test play your game with people

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.009 
can test play your game with people
abroad<00:03:39.230> or<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:40.550> know<00:03:40.660> these<00:03:41.660> people<00:03:41.870> that

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
abroad or you know these people that

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.380 
abroad or you know these people that
you're<00:03:42.230> collaborating<00:03:42.530> with<00:03:49.030> yeah<00:03:50.030> beyond

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
you're collaborating with yeah beyond

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.979 
you're collaborating with yeah beyond
that<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.570> think<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:51.019> fairly<00:03:51.290> simple<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:52.040> to

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
that I think it's fairly simple just to

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.840 
that I think it's fairly simple just to
take<00:03:53.989> this<00:03:54.140> environment<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.040> just<00:03:55.220> play<00:03:55.670> with

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
take this environment and just play with

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.390 
take this environment and just play with
it<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.150> mean<00:03:56.180> it's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.720 

there's<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.239> couple<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.659> things<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.580> can<00:04:02.580> move

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
there's a couple of things I can move

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.630 
there's a couple of things I can move
around<00:04:05.690> then<00:04:06.690> eventually<00:04:07.010> I'd<00:04:08.010> also<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.459> to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
around then eventually I'd also like to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.309 
around then eventually I'd also like to
add<00:04:08.760> proper<00:04:09.150> deck<00:04:09.390> support<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.170> can

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
add proper deck support so you can

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.289 
add proper deck support so you can
define<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> deck<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.040> cards<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.730> shuffles<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
define a deck of cards it shuffles the

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.229 
define a deck of cards it shuffles the
deck<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.220> pick<00:04:14.430> up<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.760> drop<00:04:14.909> things

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
deck and you can pick up and drop things

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.539 
deck and you can pick up and drop things
and<00:04:15.480> discrete<00:04:16.320> card<00:04:16.620> pick<00:04:16.829> up<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> pick

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and discrete card pick up so if you pick

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.349 
and discrete card pick up so if you pick
up<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.790> card

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
up a card

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.719 
up a card
it<00:04:18.419> just<00:04:18.720> becomes<00:04:19.590> visible<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.669> you

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
it just becomes visible to you and you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.020 
it just becomes visible to you and you
can<00:04:20.880> hold<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.329> your<00:04:21.419> hand<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.910> play<00:04:23.910> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
can hold it in your hand and and play it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.780 
can hold it in your hand and and play it
like<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.180> regular<00:04:24.540> deck<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.750> cards<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:26.669> other

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
like a regular deck of cards the other

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.430 
like a regular deck of cards the other
thing<00:04:27.030> I'd<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.389> add<00:04:27.660> are<00:04:27.930> some<00:04:27.960> simple

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
thing I'd like to add are some simple

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.340 
thing I'd like to add are some simple
camera<00:04:28.650> movement<00:04:29.810> possibly<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> zoom<00:04:31.139> to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
camera movement possibly a zoom to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.909 
camera movement possibly a zoom to
cursor<00:04:31.770> things<00:04:32.039> they<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.460> look<00:04:32.910> closer<00:04:33.360> at

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
cursor things they can look closer at

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.129 
cursor things they can look closer at
the<00:04:34.919> board<00:04:35.190> or<00:04:35.520> at<00:04:35.910> any<00:04:36.300> particular<00:04:36.600> thing<00:04:37.020> on

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
the board or at any particular thing on

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.330 
the board or at any particular thing on
the<00:04:37.320> board<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:39.470> then<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.710> guess<00:04:40.889> all<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.130> clear

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
the board and then I guess all the clear

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.560 
the board and then I guess all the clear
are<00:04:41.460> done<00:04:41.699> I'm<00:04:42.690> not<00:04:43.020> gonna<00:04:43.199> do<00:04:43.470> much<00:04:43.680> with<00:04:43.949> it

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
are done I'm not gonna do much with it

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.270 
are done I'm not gonna do much with it
it's<00:04:45.900> more<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.320> thought<00:04:46.530> starter<00:04:47.100> than

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
it's more of a thought starter than

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.240 
it's more of a thought starter than
anything<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:47.970> will<00:04:48.120> upload<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.810> onto

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
anything but I will upload it onto

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.850 
anything but I will upload it onto
github<00:04:50.250> or<00:04:50.960> something<00:04:51.960> similar<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.380> that
