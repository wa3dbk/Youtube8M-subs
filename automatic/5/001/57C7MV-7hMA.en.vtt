to<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:59.229> on<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.710> inside<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.100> like<00:01:00.430> style<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:01.030> it

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
to and on the inside I like style of it

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.539 
to and on the inside I like style of it
but<00:01:01.869> on<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.199> outside<00:01:02.559> it's<00:01:02.769> a<00:01:02.830> bit<00:01:02.979> manly<00:01:03.400> it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
but on the outside it's a bit manly it's

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.850 
but on the outside it's a bit manly it's
a<00:01:03.610> bit<00:01:03.790> matching<00:01:04.299> from<00:01:04.509> totally<00:01:04.900> honest<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
a bit matching from totally honest the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.630 
a bit matching from totally honest the
front<00:01:06.159> looks<00:01:06.520> like<00:01:06.790> an<00:01:07.030> monsters<00:01:07.750> mouth<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.890> I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
front looks like an monsters mouth and I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.050 
front looks like an monsters mouth and I
think<00:01:09.939> it's<00:01:10.119> designed<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:11.170> appeal<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.500> men<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
think it's designed to appeal to men and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.600 
think it's designed to appeal to men and
I<00:01:13.210> think<00:01:13.450> women<00:01:13.570> like<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.110> easy<00:01:14.500> way<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.159> it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
I think women like the easy way that it

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.030 
I think women like the easy way that it
can<00:01:15.759> be<00:01:15.790> driven<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:17.500> by<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.650> lack<00:01:17.829> of<00:01:17.860> any

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
can be driven well by the lack of any

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.499 
can be driven well by the lack of any
parking<00:01:18.579> sensors<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.060> mean<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.329> is<00:01:19.479> a
