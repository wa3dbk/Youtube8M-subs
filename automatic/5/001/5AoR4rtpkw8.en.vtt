00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.820
 the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 I send 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.610
 the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.730
 then 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.730
 No 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.370
 hello my needs of the pond and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.590
 marketing manager for 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.210
 New Holland Benelux and I have the honor 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.370
 in the green you get the new one 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.530
 enrich for the richard cells 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.610
 here behind me and in the picture 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.300
 that's the 7 point 42 7 stands for 7 meters 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.840
 and rich know and then of course the 42 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.110
 100 times for four would be 1200 kilograms 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.980
 lifting capacity replaces dlm 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.680
 5040 the 60 and the 80 and these still have 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.229
 in 5 different models 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.330
 we start with the six point 35 and go 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.340
 up to and including 9 points 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.619
 42 engines are 121 or 143 hp 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.900
 rated power and there me then and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.690
 left version in the left's version 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.880
 equipped with a specialist as standard 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.760
 on the left version also equipped 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.280
 with a 6 times drink shipment of 6 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.600
 for out of three backwards and of course the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.360
 last 3 speeds 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 we then have an auto shift function 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.640
 the basic version is then four times three 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.810
 gearbox 4 forward and three 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.940
 backwards 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.550
 Cabinet is completely new will you 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.430
 soon history and of course also the farmer 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.860
 has been greatly strengthened wherever we have one 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.460
 have patented 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.660
 and we're standing in front of the p6 car command 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.300
 the trigger 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.690
 Dutch market because it is the first 4 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 cylinder is with an automatic 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.590
 CVT transmission so the car 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.170
 novels called standard equipped 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.330
 with a sidewinder armrest 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.670
 these will of course show you later 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.040
 biggest advantage of this auto command 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.070
 is that it is compact short turning circle 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.240
 and you also had a low weight of your own 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.510
 exists in 3 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.900
 hp versions the 640 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.790
 the 150 and the 160 hp 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.670
 maximum power or nominal power 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.080
 of 110 120 and 130 so the ideal traits 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.780
 where the netherlands 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.370
 has waited a long time 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080
 and here would be the for the very latest 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.180
 concept of the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.910
 New Holland tractor methane his the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.140
 t640 this tractor is equipped with a 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.340
 four-cylinder 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.319
 3 liter engine with 4 valves per cylinder 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.819
 reproduces no less than 100 pounds 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.930
 when comes to 136 hp that his work there 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.380
 is equipped with 9 washing tanks but 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.630
 the total capacity of 300 liters 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.239
 rocks benefit from this methane doctor 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.940
 on the one hand, the cost is still over 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.130
 those so between 25 and 40 percent 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.230
 lower and, of course, whole 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.769
 important are the skin so standards 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.360
 the environmental standards not less than 80% 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.470
 reduced to the autonomy of 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.150
 this trigger 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.750
 to be worked on but it is one 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.160
 intermediate step to our hydrogen tractor 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.739
 hydrogen tracker will of course still be 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.030
 further testing on labyad is almost experienced 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.100
 totally complete 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.590
 but now we are still looking for the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.930
 cost of the fuel cell 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.030
 for the in h2 pull but the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.320
 blue he is ready and we 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.690
 may be more of sarah 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.910
 We stand for the next 60 chili 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.270
 meter and this machine is special 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.210
 equipped with dual stream 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.640
 heather between dual screen heather that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.860
 system that wrong club is sitting there 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.800
 my word if we put this on a heap too 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.080
 placing 25 and 30 centimeters then will 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.840
 the lower blade about ex 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.060
 Sweden at 10 to 15 centimeters 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.580
 that we were the one here was about him 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.280
 a fourteen centimeter up here 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.400
 being pushed to the ground becomes your being 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.460
 loop roll system is powered by 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.170
 a yogi box that then knives here 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.389
 mechanically start driving on the 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.080
 right side and left side and this one 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.910
 honda 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.169
 opposite of is opposite of 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.290
 cutting the crop apart 15 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.360
 a 20 centimeters less crop in the 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.960
 machine basically means that there are 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.880
 15 and 20% more capacity such as one 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.940
 hard my daughter and of course also 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.940
 the same low consumption that we have more here 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.910
 residues stream header kept for this 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.190
 to the injured on the indicated 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.130
 experts where you can see this machine 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.350
 from 3 to 8 December 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.350
 where of course everyone is welcome
