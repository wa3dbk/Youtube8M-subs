00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.109
 [music] 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello everyone, I'm coming back again 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 to the topic of delayed hopper and speech 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.269
 talk about a silent scheme let's start in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 construction 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.670
 we put 2 blocks and 2 red torches on top 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.180
 two comparators are sent to these blocks 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
 two more blocks on top two comparators 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 the opposite side and now us 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.300
 Need to put four hoppers 2 hoppers 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 will be down here so they should 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 go to each other two more 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 hoppers are installed between torches and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180
 me upper comparator they should be 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 also put each other put 2 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 block over one block lower copiers 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 here is the red torch 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.149
 this is the input of our circuit the output of our circuit 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 will be located right here 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.950
 set repeat let's set 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 for example, the button here and charge 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.329
 our diagram next to the red torch you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.030
 should in harper place one any 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.280
 subject further upper operas opposite 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 burning torch place the necessary 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 number of items 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 this quantity will be determined 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.640
 the duration of our delay let's 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 try our scheme in action push 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.869
 a button appeared on the button and the output 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.939
 which will last depending on 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 of how many blocks we put the top 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.170
 opera here is our signal gone remind 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.299
 what is the speed of moving blocks 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 is two and a half blocks seconds 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 between hackers that is defining 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 the number of blocks when we define on 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 what is the duration we calculated our 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 delay 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 well now let's try 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 find out how this scheme works 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.460
 lower opera perform the role of such a cell 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 the default memory item we have 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 is right here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.189
 when we submit our data signal opera 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.530
 unlocked and the item is transferred 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.990
 far hopper upper operas with us 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.030
 give here a blocking signal when 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 we begin the transfer of items here 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 from here that is to our exit 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 both of these comparators are blocked more precisely 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.490
 the signal appears on them are blocked both 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.130
 hopper and the subject remains far 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 Opera lower comparators we manage 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.240
 here these torches respectively now 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.610
 lit neighbor comparator because 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 the subject of the hopper near Highbury 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.380
 unlocked give it back no hopper blocked 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 and all items remain in it when 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.379
 us the subject gets into further that is when 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.120
 enable circuit 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.860
 we have a nickname 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.900
 otherwise donâ€™t give me a hopper 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.299
 unlocked and near the opposite 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.610
 blocked and all items will be and them 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.530
 stay until all items from there 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 go over here as soon as everyone 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.209
 items turn out in this hoppers 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.730
 the signal over there we have disappears and our 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.860
 personal item goes back here 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.140
 that is, the circuit is reset and items 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 starts moving back here this 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.250
 time that spends items to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 go first here entirely and then 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.510
 back and this is our delay 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.819
 the more items the longer the delay 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.140
 it is about doubled 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.060
 the ratio of the number of items 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.220
 respectively, knowing the speed of movement 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 those two and a half items in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 second and number of items we can 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.579
 fairly accurately calculate our 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.010
 The exit delay is such a scheme it is 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.810
 absolutely silently does not use pistons 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.909
 and hope you enjoyed it and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.700
 useful and on this for today 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.799
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget
