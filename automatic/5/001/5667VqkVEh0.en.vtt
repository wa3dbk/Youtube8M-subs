the cap make sure to get off all the
excess<00:01:06.240> residue<00:01:06.630> left<00:01:07.049> behind<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:08.100> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
excess residue left behind we're then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
excess residue left behind we're then
going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> cut<00:01:08.610> off<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> end<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> bottle

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
going to cut off the end of the bottle

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
going to cut off the end of the bottle
near<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> very<00:01:10.350> bottom<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> small

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
near the very bottom if you have a small

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
near the very bottom if you have a small
aquarium<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.330> require<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> smaller<00:01:13.080> filter

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
aquarium and require a smaller filter

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
aquarium and require a smaller filter
simply<00:01:14.040> make<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> cut<00:01:14.729> higher<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.350> we're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
simply make this cut higher up we're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.870 
simply make this cut higher up we're
then<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> mark<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> spot<00:01:17.040> halfway<00:01:17.729> down

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
then going to mark a spot halfway down

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
then going to mark a spot halfway down
the<00:01:18.030> bottle<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.110> drill<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the bottle which we will drill out and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
the bottle which we will drill out and
eventually<00:01:20.070> place<00:01:20.549> our<00:01:20.759> suction<00:01:21.030> cup<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
eventually place our suction cup the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
eventually place our suction cup the
size<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.650> hole<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:23.159> depend<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
size of this hole will depend on the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
size of this hole will depend on the
size<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> shape<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> suction<00:01:25.380> cup

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
size and the shape of the suction cup

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
size and the shape of the suction cup
you're<00:01:25.740> using<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> mark

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you're using we're then going to mark

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
you're using we're then going to mark
and<00:01:27.509> drill<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.780> hole<00:01:28.080> near<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> neck<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and drill a hole near the neck of the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.620 
and drill a hole near the neck of the
bottle<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> where<00:01:30.329> we're<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
bottle this is where we're going to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.660 
bottle this is where we're going to
insert<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.290> airline<00:01:31.710> tubing<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
insert our airline tubing so a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.690 
insert our airline tubing so a
quarter-inch<00:01:33.090> drill<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:33.810> work<00:01:34.020> perfect

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
quarter-inch drill bit will work perfect

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
quarter-inch drill bit will work perfect
next<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.939> push<00:01:36.150> our<00:01:36.299> airline<00:01:36.600> tubing<00:01:36.840> through

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
next we push our airline tubing through

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
next we push our airline tubing through
the<00:01:37.560> hole<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> end<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> bottle<00:01:39.060> which

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the hole to the end of the bottle which

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
the hole to the end of the bottle which
enables<00:01:39.869> us<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> easily<00:01:40.500> attach<00:01:40.680> our<00:01:41.100> air

enables us to easily attach our air

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730 
enables us to easily attach our air
stone<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.540> retract<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.170> piece<00:01:43.409> back

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
stone we then retract this piece back

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.020 
stone we then retract this piece back
down<00:01:44.009> towards<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> neck<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> bottle

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
down towards the neck of the bottle

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
down towards the neck of the bottle
where<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.899> fixed<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.320> position<00:01:46.549> at

you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.689> add<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> bead<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.259> silicone<00:01:55.470> around<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you can add a bead of silicone around it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
you can add a bead of silicone around it
to<00:01:56.340> help<00:01:56.549> hold<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.969> place<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:58.259> size

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

but<00:02:00.960> again<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.860> bio<00:02:02.130> balls<00:02:02.399> or

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
but again you can use bio balls or

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.539 
but again you can use bio balls or
ceramic<00:02:03.240> rings<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.930> prefer<00:02:04.290> our<00:02:04.560> airline

filter<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.939> now<00:02:06.030> complete<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.840> let's<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
filter is now complete so let's put it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.990 
filter is now complete so let's put it
in<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> tank<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:07.920> how<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> works<00:02:08.670> our

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
