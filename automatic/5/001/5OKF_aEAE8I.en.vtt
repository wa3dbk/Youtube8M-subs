lately and i had loved seeing more
ritual<00:01:30.180> monster<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.509> thought<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
ritual monster just thought it was a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.359 
ritual monster just thought it was a
cool<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> sending<00:01:31.530> cards<00:01:31.860> even<00:01:32.220> though

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
cool way of sending cards even though

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.890 
cool way of sending cards even though
it's<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.640> guess<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.970> slow<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.479> some
