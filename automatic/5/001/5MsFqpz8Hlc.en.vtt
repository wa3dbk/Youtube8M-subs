this<00:00:09.330> tutorial<00:00:09.780> first<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.260> all<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.590> Halloween

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
this tutorial first of all my Halloween

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.919 
this tutorial first of all my Halloween
makeup<00:00:11.099> tutorials<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.670> because<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.480> thought

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
makeup tutorials just because I thought

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.570 
makeup tutorials just because I thought
this<00:00:13.139> tutorial<00:00:13.590> was<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> most<00:00:14.009> versatile

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this tutorial was the most versatile

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.210 
this tutorial was the most versatile
because<00:00:14.820> although<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.540> my<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.800> vision

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
because although in my you know vision

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
because although in my you know vision
it<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> fairy<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.390> could<00:00:18.750> definitely<00:00:18.960> use

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it was a fairy you could definitely use

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.370 
it was a fairy you could definitely use
this<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.070> mermaid<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.320> know

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this for like a mermaid or I don't know

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.630 
this for like a mermaid or I don't know
just<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> feel<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> could<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.400> so

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
just I feel like you could use it for so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.250 
just I feel like you could use it for so
many<00:00:23.820> different<00:00:24.000> things<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> figured<00:00:25.109> that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
many different things so I figured that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.240 
many different things so I figured that
this<00:00:25.350> would<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.099> would

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this would be the first one that I would

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.339 
this would be the first one that I would
put<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.689> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> make

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
put up and then you know kind of make

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.960 
put up and then you know kind of make
them<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:28.680> bit<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:28.920> specific<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.789> go

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
them a little bit more specific as I go

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
them a little bit more specific as I go
on<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> thought<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
on but I thought this one was kind of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.500 
on but I thought this one was kind of
more<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> general<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.850> yeah<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.180> hope<00:00:33.420> you
