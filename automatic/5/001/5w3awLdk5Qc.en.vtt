you<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.380> start<00:02:33.800> because<00:02:34.430> all<00:02:34.640> you're<00:02:34.790> going

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
you just start because all you're going

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.240 
you just start because all you're going

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to do is just plug it in and format it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.950 
to do is just plug it in and format it
right<00:02:37.430> away<00:02:37.520> after<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.000> drivers<00:02:38.390> install<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
right away after the drivers install and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.600 
right away after the drivers install and
everything<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.500> then<00:02:39.980> once<00:02:40.190> that's<00:02:40.310> done<00:02:40.550> you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
everything and then once that's done you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.550 
everything and then once that's done you
can<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.360> install<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> drivers<00:02:42.290> but

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
can you know on install the drivers but

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.530 
can you know on install the drivers but
that's<00:02:43.070> more<00:02:43.520> hassle<00:02:44.000> which<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.360> really

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that's more hassle which you really

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.610 
that's more hassle which you really
don't<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.900> worry<00:02:45.110> about<00:02:45.230> with<00:02:45.590> a

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
don't have to worry about with a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.600 
don't have to worry about with a
distance<00:02:46.250> 7<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:48.080> once<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.500> format<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
distance 7 so once you format it you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.010 
distance 7 so once you format it you
will<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.030> pop<00:02:50.210> up<00:02:50.240> here<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:50.780> what<00:02:50.930> you're

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
will see it pop up here so what you're

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.840 
will see it pop up here so what you're
going<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.320> now<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.980> speed<00:02:52.340> up<00:02:52.640> your

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
going to do now is the speed up your

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.540 
going to do now is the speed up your
memory<00:02:53.470> basically<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.860> we're<00:02:55.160> going<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> use

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
memory basically is we're going to use

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.260 
memory basically is we're going to use
this<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.210> flash<00:02:56.990> drive<00:02:57.290> here<00:02:57.650> as<00:02:58.270> memory

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
this little flash drive here as memory

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.240 
this little flash drive here as memory
so<00:02:59.720> this<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.140> going<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.410> like<00:03:00.530> backup<00:03:00.800> or<00:03:01.130> an

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
so this is going to be like backup or an

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.010 
so this is going to be like backup or an
which<00:03:01.610> will<00:03:01.790> make<00:03:01.880> your<00:03:02.030> system<00:03:02.390> run<00:03:02.540> faster

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
which will make your system run faster

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.210 
which will make your system run faster
now<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.220> be<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.610> windows<00:03:05.570> XP<00:03:05.810> or<00:03:06.350> not

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
now you have to be on windows XP or not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.320 
now you have to be on windows XP or not
XP<00:03:07.460> sorry<00:03:08.060> Windows<00:03:08.900> Vista<00:03:09.140> or<00:03:09.770> Windows<00:03:10.240> 7<00:03:11.240> and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
systems like 32-bit can run up to four

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.680 
systems like 32-bit can run up to four
gigs<00:04:46.850> um<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:49.730> if<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.880> have<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.210> three<00:04:50.480> gigs

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
gigs um so if you have like three gigs

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.280 
gigs um so if you have like three gigs
you<00:04:50.930> can<00:04:51.080> use<00:04:51.530> an<00:04:51.680> extra<00:04:51.920> gig<00:04:52.160> ah<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.900> if

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
you can use an extra gig ah but if

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.370 
you can use an extra gig ah but if
you're<00:04:54.440> running<00:04:54.650> an<00:04:54.710> X<00:04:54.920> 64<00:04:55.670> bit<00:04:56.380> operating

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
you're running an X 64 bit operating

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.570 
you're running an X 64 bit operating
system<00:04:57.770> they<00:04:58.640> can<00:04:58.940> use<00:04:59.810> up<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.220> 16<00:05:01.220> gigs<00:05:01.460> of

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
system they can use up to 16 gigs of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.520 
system they can use up to 16 gigs of
data<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.210> yeah<00:05:02.570> that's<00:05:02.720> pretty<00:05:02.840> cool<00:05:03.110> so

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
data so yeah that's pretty cool so

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.060 
data so yeah that's pretty cool so
that's<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:05.140> that's<00:05:06.140> how<00:05:06.320> you<00:05:06.380> do<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.530> so

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
that's it and that's how you do it so

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.600 
that's it and that's how you do it so
talk<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.460> later<00:05:07.520> guys<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.120> enjoy
