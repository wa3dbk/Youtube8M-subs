00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.009 
towards the victory I mean that that was
the<00:02:28.069> reasoning<00:02:28.430> behind<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.239> three

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the reasoning behind it you know three

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.150 
the reasoning behind it you know three
three<00:02:30.530> bases<00:02:30.950> three<00:02:31.190> covers<00:02:32.260> yeah<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.739> I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
three bases three covers yeah and I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.860 
three bases three covers yeah and I
quickly<00:02:34.580> learned<00:02:34.910> where<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.209> spawns<00:02:35.599> were

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
quickly learned where the spawns were

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.930 
quickly learned where the spawns were
and<00:02:36.470> you'll<00:02:36.620> see<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.830> little<00:02:37.099> Betty<00:02:37.340> trick<00:02:37.730> that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
and you'll see a little Betty trick that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
where you spawn the game spawn system so

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.110 
where you spawn the game spawn system so
messed<00:03:11.780> up<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.739> will<00:03:13.099> basically<00:03:13.340> spawn<00:03:14.090> a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120

is early in the free-for-all session but

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000 
is early in the free-for-all session but
towards<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.750> end<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.169> I<00:03:30.319> actually<00:03:30.440> got<00:03:30.769> the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
towards the end of it I actually got the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.240 
towards the end of it I actually got the
rapid<00:03:31.459> fire<00:03:31.669> a<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.139> two<00:03:33.530> attachments<00:03:34.130> for

rapid fire a in the two attachments for

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.420 
rapid fire a in the two attachments for
this<00:03:34.400> thing<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.940> range<00:03:35.209> efficiency<00:03:35.980> man<00:03:36.980> this

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
this thing the range efficiency man this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.129 
this thing the range efficiency man this
that<00:03:37.639> gives<00:03:37.849> as<00:03:38.000> good<00:03:38.030> as<00:03:38.419> an<00:03:38.540> assault<00:03:39.049> rifle

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
that gives as good as an assault rifle

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.849
