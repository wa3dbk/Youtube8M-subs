00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
so we have one of the good things about

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.800 
so we have one of the good things about
anvilnext<00:01:24.430> on<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:24.850> engine<00:01:25.149> is<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.390> allows<00:01:25.630> us

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
anvilnext on you engine is it allows us

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.510 
anvilnext on you engine is it allows us
to<00:01:25.930> have<00:01:26.020> dynamic<00:01:26.259> weather<00:01:26.530> systems<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.130> we

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
to have dynamic weather systems and we

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.190 
to have dynamic weather systems and we
also<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.910> new<00:01:28.119> ocean<00:01:28.270> simulation<00:01:28.960> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
also have a new ocean simulation and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.740 
also have a new ocean simulation and
this<00:01:29.680> allows<00:01:29.950> us<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.369> have<00:01:30.550> both<00:01:31.210> four<00:01:31.420> levels

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
this allows us to have both four levels

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.539 
this allows us to have both four levels
which<00:01:31.870> is<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> height<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.680> waves<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
which is the height of the waves in the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.430 
which is the height of the waves in the
wind<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:34.720> be<00:01:34.750> set<00:01:34.990> up<00:01:35.110> by<00:01:35.260> our

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
wind so this can be set up by our

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.380 
wind so this can be set up by our
mission<00:01:35.920> designers<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.760> can<00:01:37.090> really

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
mission designers and and can really

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.440 
mission designers and and can really
affect<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.380> gameplay<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.370> waves<00:01:39.580> will

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
affect the gameplay so the waves will

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.060 
affect the gameplay so the waves will
really<00:01:40.720> impact<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.110> gameplay<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.680> way<00:01:41.799> that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
really impact the gameplay in a way that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.640 
really impact the gameplay in a way that
where<00:01:42.970> your<00:01:43.119> cannons<00:01:43.510> hit<00:01:43.720> what<00:01:44.200> moment<00:01:44.590> you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
where your cannons hit what moment you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.890 
where your cannons hit what moment you
choose<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:45.010> fire<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.790> on<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.360> crest<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.810> a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
choose to fire so if you on a crest of a

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.270 
choose to fire so if you on a crest of a
wave<00:01:46.930> that's<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.409> great<00:01:47.619> moment<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.979> unleash

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
wave that's a great moment to unleash

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.710 
wave that's a great moment to unleash
your<00:01:48.430> broadside<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.030> really<00:01:49.330> feel<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
your broadside and really feel the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.149 
your broadside and really feel the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.730 

tell<00:01:55.159> us<00:01:55.280> about<00:01:55.969> how<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.240> naval<00:01:56.990> combat<00:01:57.170> CEG's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
combat and so here we have Connor is at

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.240 
combat and so here we have Connor is at
the<00:02:08.959> wheel<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.319> he's<00:02:09.470> very<00:02:09.619> much<00:02:09.800> controlling

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the wheel so he's very much controlling

buffs on the team how historically

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.280 
buffs on the team how historically
accurate<00:03:59.220> were<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.150> trying<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.870> with<00:04:01.170> us

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
accurate were you trying to be with us

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.520 
accurate were you trying to be with us
so<00:04:01.500> we<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.370> historians<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> team<00:04:03.239> and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
so we do have historians on the team and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.289 
so we do have historians on the team and
we<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.890> respect<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.370> as<00:04:05.580> much<00:04:05.730> as<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.150> at

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
we we respect that as much as we can at

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.870 
we we respect that as much as we can at
the<00:04:06.390> same<00:04:06.540> time<00:04:06.780> these<00:04:07.709> ships<00:04:08.040> were<00:04:08.250> pretty

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
the same time these ships were pretty

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.610 
the same time these ships were pretty
slow<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.390> not<00:04:09.480> very<00:04:09.540> maneuverable<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.380> we<00:04:10.500> had

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
slow and not very maneuverable so we had

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.020 
slow and not very maneuverable so we had
to<00:04:10.769> balance<00:04:11.269> historical<00:04:12.269> accuracy<00:04:12.510> with<00:04:12.959> fun

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
to balance historical accuracy with fun

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.819 
to balance historical accuracy with fun
so<00:04:15.030> real<00:04:15.269> historically<00:04:16.169> accurate<00:04:16.350> naval

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
so real historically accurate naval

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.140 
so real historically accurate naval
battle<00:04:17.130> would<00:04:17.250> have<00:04:17.370> been<00:04:17.489> several<00:04:17.789> hours<00:04:17.910> of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
battle would have been several hours of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.569 
battle would have been several hours of
slow<00:04:18.450> sera<00:04:18.750> several<00:04:19.530> days<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.070> yeah<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> mean

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
slow sera several days so yeah I mean

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.370 
slow sera several days so yeah I mean
this<00:04:20.760> battle<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.269> Chesapeake<00:04:21.959> battle<00:04:22.260> yeah

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
this battle the Chesapeake battle yeah

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.040 
this battle the Chesapeake battle yeah
it<00:04:22.620> was<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.220> few<00:04:23.970> hours<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.300> few<00:04:24.570> broad<00:04:24.780> trials

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
it was a few hours a few broad trials

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.360 
it was a few hours a few broad trials
would<00:04:25.169> have<00:04:25.260> been<00:04:25.350> shot<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:25.680> no<00:04:25.830> way<00:04:26.010> with

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
would have been shot but no way with

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.460 
would have been shot but no way with
dozens<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.450> ships<00:04:27.600> being<00:04:27.870> sunk<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.289> few

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
dozens of ships being sunk in a few
