 information about psychotronic weapons 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.700
 declaring that it simply is not true 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.690

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.670
 such organizations appeared in other

 major cities and they also say that it is from 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.570

 where is the truth in this story and where is fiction 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.829
 figured out Andrei Sparrows

 unlucky so as not to protect 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 white house from capture 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.280

 video ticket 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.980
 people don't understand people themselves the result

 sniper shot bribes tanker 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.550
 think nothing this is exactly the day before 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 this in the area of ​​the Black Sea 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 magazine for the american cruiser 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.220
 groups of ship finding phenomena in 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 Mordovia was covered with a veil of secrecy gbagbo 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.990
 and his board was allowed only by special 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.860
 skip 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.680
 I did not know what was added 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.150
 Prodor was on the ship 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.690
 and even today after all these years 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.660
 depends on the logbook stored under 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.440
 top secret experts 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.790
 believe that the American cruiser 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.520
 was a dream but they caught up with the decisions of si 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.160
 weapons minutes a day and radars to force 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.760
 who were on the ship instead 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.000
 conventional weapons 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.550
 nineteenth of august failed 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.950
 Experts believe that maybe this is not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.650
 led to the august coup in 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.000
 Moscow 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 since then scientists call 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.370
 in Russia 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 the first 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.190
 surge of interest in the network 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.650
 how do you think 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 83 thousand 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.009
 first appeared 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.299
 on forming narrowly focused 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.249
 gamma radiation on board was heading to 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.089
 one hour rush cardiologists 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.999
 pensioners 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.999
 in various types of bonds allowed 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.849
 it will survive 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.199
 intrusive memories 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.969
 range of the device 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.459
 in a small 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.789
 one and a half thousand meters 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.789
 you can say it was the answer 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.749
 and manipulate the mind 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.109
 we are seeing at the level of evidence 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.259
 about that and anyone is capable 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.849
 influence 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.849
 on another person at any distance 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.549
 aha experts say that in the ussr 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.269
 psychotechnologies were not engaged in more than 20 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.929
 closed institute 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.679
 and by the mid eighties 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.469
 engineering thought to create 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.969
 psychotronic instruments blossomed 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.199
 shkadinova work center 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.429
 traditional technology and heart 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.889
 in 1987 the prime ministers of sports 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.419
 approved a program for use 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.889
 technology in the national economy 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.109
 j the last section said that 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.669
 life management tools european 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.169
 decision making mechanism 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.979
 then all technologies were considered the best 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.749
 tool enhancement 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.019
 if we know 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.010
 it reduce the level of aggressiveness 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.429
 tensions 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.789
 you can poke but vice versa 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.089
 well imagine if suddenly percent 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.309
 but in the period of hostilities fighting 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.289
 what country do you want 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.379
 let's take these flowers in the council together 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.179
 remember that 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.379
 on these unique frames you see 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.569
 psychological session 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.489
 processing 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.650
 man involuntarily 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.019
 being done on their own will starts 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.879
 move around pakhomov those 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.459
 experts say man 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.739
 behaves weird just because he 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.209
 mined 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.709
 Artificial stowed in his brain 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.459
 institution's program and now they can 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.709
 drive from any distance yuri 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.589
 Rabotin believes that the most advanced 

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.739
 everyday money is special services 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.750
 they can even passengers new 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.490
 personality of a person who can 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.460
 switch on at a certain level 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.020
 similar situation 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.090
 seemingly ordinary tourist 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.409
 expressing another country 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.459
 keyword may be the roughest 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.369
 rubles, that is, you can customize the program 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:37.389
 probe 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.460
 would you need a keyword 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.949
 novaport from avon present passport 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.449
 it may already be a keyword 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.059
 go on season 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.359
 who will find upa this performance 

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:51.299
 on this before the secret information 

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:53.159
 on report tuesday 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.099
 comes back airport so 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.400
 key phrase 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.729
 unveiled striking conventional ones ie he 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.259
 so what happened there that he 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.569
 did 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.179
 in the twenty first century with the development 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.099
 technologies have changed and ways 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:07.999
 impacts 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.519
 according to experts if 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.569
 earlier to record 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.409
 all the pogroms were required 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.399
 generators who now only need 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.590
 small profits 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.389
 in which you can hide in any container 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.270
 who you carrier pc phone smartphone 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.050
 mobile phone and radio and 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.550
 man is expected to be zombied 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.790
 take the nursery consider encode and 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.800
 write background for example in advertising 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.259
 movie which is a large population 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.389
 under this our and then in its original form 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.180
 Kaztag 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.319
 so the same bunny sounds but 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.999
 coded version 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.999
 Yu 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.210
 it seems that this is normal 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.710
 this stuff 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.440
 on the owner of texas integrity 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.180
 cup does not cause 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 but the writer herself quotes 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
 instead they think that there can never be 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.969
 dismantled at any noise 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.639
 in the musical congress 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.639
 during which sounds fresh 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.710
 but scary even 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.650
 all technologies are private 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.350
 today there are known cases of selling through 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.069
 some fall 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.520
 to impact their customers and 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.089
 opportunities abroad 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.089
 it all depends on the goals 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 it is clear that it is profitable for them now that 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.840
 we have up to five million homeless 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.039
 children 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.229
 I understand they can be brothers 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.339
 introduce 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:48.939
 bring up a zombie and 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.169
 grow his warriors 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.839
 for certain purposes 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.119
 honey some specialists 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.599
 claim that these technologies have long been 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.459
 got out of state control after us 

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:01.509
 talking about it and the increasing of 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:02.740
 Year per year quantity 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.860
 342 microsoft in Russia explains 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.120
 biographical amnesty the best of 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.979
 Russian women 2 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.069
 need to explain what people are losing 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.559
 seminar participants on the subject possible 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.469
 now we just got blocked today 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:19.999
 the experts are sounding the alarm 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:21.949
 unless in the near future affect 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.619
 situation if the state does not 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.079
 take control of everything 

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.789
 technology who knows what hands will be 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:29.579
 used generators in their own 

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.089
 selfish purposes 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.330
 so it or not 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.710
 I think we can find out very soon by 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.759
 experts predict in fifteen years 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.810
 when will those first technologies appear 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.030
 on the arsenal of some sort of Western 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.330
 powers by the way all weapons are very 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.389
 dangerous it is perhaps much more dangerous than 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.460
 nuclear bomb or long-range missiles 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.699
 radius of action and I think we're still 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:51.590
 we will find the time when on the council 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:51.630
 security
