00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.000
 it can be removed until the protection is removed 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.330
 it's possible 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.809
 reposition 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.389
 this sticker 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.179
 then that's enough 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.909
 cs I do - putting myself 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.909
 as well as 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.079
 indeed we remove the fux 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.079
 you work better on a plan 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.490
 now it's perfect 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.870
 off when you have it 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.710
 put in perfect way with done I always on rg come 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.190
 smooth veil 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.720
 make sure it adheres by losing 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
 to the surface 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650
 so the part is the com key 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.070
 that is, our goal I removed post 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 we take protection off a lot 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.380
 and let's go for it too 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 first let's start this way 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 which then we go upwards 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.930
 office will always tend to be longer than the cover 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.430
 It is not so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.480
 you have to look for the lot 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.020
 to the cover 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.930
 then always with 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.260
 our slotted screwdriver 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.230
 the skewer in modiche 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.660
 adhere well 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 and then when our true increases 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.990
 work done 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.650
 this support is ready to receive its glass 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.540
 just take off the protection esd above we can put our glass 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 and then the display 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.420
 so this video why 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.970
 you can change part 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.360
 for glass support because 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.419
 seems to open we close 3 ambition we see our ifo 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.039
 this protection is broken 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 outside that serves to keep our dust out 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.469
 I hope I have been clear enough 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.979
 yes with what you did not understand you can ask questions art of sol y mar 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.379
 thanks to all from icon system
