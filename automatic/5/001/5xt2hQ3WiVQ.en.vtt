00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
itself is not very wide it's like like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
itself is not very wide it's like like
half<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.390> width<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.899> head<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.430> your

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
half of the width of head so if your

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.130 
half of the width of head so if your
head<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:58.040> three<00:01:59.040> centimeters<00:01:59.780> two<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
head is like three centimeters two and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
head is like three centimeters two and
two<00:02:01.680> centimeters<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.240> width<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> food<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.740> one

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
two centimeters the width of food is one

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.369 
two centimeters the width of food is one
centimeter<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:08.119> now<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.599> adding<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
centimeter so now I'm just adding the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.150 
centimeter so now I'm just adding the
shadows<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.610> black

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
shadows with black

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.830 
shadows with black
I<00:02:13.190> must<00:02:13.970> be<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:15.160> I'm<00:02:16.160> trying<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.670> be

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
I must be like I'm trying to be

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.450 
I must be like I'm trying to be
eco-friendly<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.740> think<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.190> time<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
eco-friendly but I think it's time to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.160 
eco-friendly but I think it's time to
buy<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> new<00:02:20.180> pencil

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
buy a new pencil

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:43.390 
buy a new pencil
it's<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.040> looks<00:02:40.270> so<00:02:41.270> next<00:02:41.600> shoes<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.560> after

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it's like looks so next shoes so after

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580 
it's like looks so next shoes so after
you<00:02:43.550> finish<00:02:43.730> drawing<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.480> it's<00:02:44.690> very<00:02:44.990> easy<00:02:45.380> to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
you finish drawing it it's very easy to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.430 
you finish drawing it it's very easy to
call<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.000> now<00:02:47.420> we're<00:02:47.690> dealing<00:02:48.020> with<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
call it so now we're dealing with a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.090 
call it so now we're dealing with a
patent<00:02:49.130> leather<00:02:49.370> again<00:02:49.820> it's<00:02:50.180> very<00:02:50.330> bright<00:02:51.100> so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
patent leather again it's very bright so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.560 
patent leather again it's very bright so
now<00:02:53.030> we're<00:02:53.420> coloring<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.320> just<00:02:54.620> with<00:02:54.830> black

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
now we're coloring it just with black

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
now we're coloring it just with black
marker<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.770> then<00:02:57.770> we<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.160> add<00:02:58.370> after

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
marker and then we will add after

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.290 
marker and then we will add after
super-bright<00:03:00.590> reflection<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.580> light<00:03:01.820> with

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
super-bright reflection of light with

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.050 
super-bright reflection of light with
using<00:03:02.840> our<00:03:02.960> white<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.190> jelly<00:03:04.580> pan

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
using our white in jelly pan

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.190 
using our white in jelly pan
so<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:07.030> initially<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.630> have<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> small

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
so now initially here we have a small

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
so now initially here we have a small
