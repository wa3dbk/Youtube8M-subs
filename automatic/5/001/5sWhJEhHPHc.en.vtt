00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.509
 never like this year after so many years 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429
 of formula 1 there is an opportunity 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.810
 extraordinary that our direction 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.150
 technique must seize a change 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.100
 regulation was so important 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.769
 really for a very long time now 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.140
 he saw in our racing world e 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.570
 so as such it is an opportunity I repeat 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.969
 that must be seized even if we are aware of the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 great difficulties especially united to the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.719
 season that these changes on 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.649
 engine on the powertrain in general 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.410
 they can carry they can carry around 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.289
 I believe that in these years the process 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 reorganization was already 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.780
 sometimes started more 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.539
 silent other times by making 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.789
 interventions with more famous characters in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.800
 world of formula 1 then below 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.340
 the organizational aspect is so many things 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.899
 different 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.239
 from the point of view of investments 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.470
 let's not forget that we did 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 wind tunnel update 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 of the simulation tools 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.979
 well this is clear means giving 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.680
 the opportunity to our technicians of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 work differently and therefore me 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 aspect we expect of course from 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 luthi them an important result 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 because we certainly can't say that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 resources are lacking 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.299
 and clear that however on the other side 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.130
 we must maintain those values 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.560
 important that these have been confirmed 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.409
 years then our level skill 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.369
 of the strategies the work of the Alps 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.490
 stop 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.650
 I think this year at the beginning 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 especially in the beginning everyone 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 we should understand how to interpret al 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 better the races will be an opportunity for the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.009
 fans watching from home for 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.560
 understand how the efficiency aspect 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.390
 of petrol and use in the race 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 should therefore be exploited 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.020
 extra element for those who have the tools 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.560
 best best people for 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 to emerge 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.930
 but I believe we have set up 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.660
 a series of organizational initiatives 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.369
 especially to ensure that you really do 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.630
 this year is a season where 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.960
 we must take the result home 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.610
 area that we have lacked for some time and 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.300
 that we have touched as we said before 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.330
 for nothing 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.070
 a short time ago the mistake we must not make 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 commit is above all that 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.900
 at the beginning to yield to the pressures that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.640
 will be many to get into a panic 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.440
 sporty if as I expect above all 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.880
 in the first days of texts will be the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.780
 difficulties to be addressed as well as 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.630
 they all had 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.550
 here is the only mistake that 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.500
 I demand from men that they do not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.800
 that is to say, to leave 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.920
 carry on from emotion that doesn't make you 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.790
 work well at an early stage 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.040
 where I believe that above all 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.040
 reliability must make the difference
