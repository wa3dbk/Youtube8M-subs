profiles<00:00:13.349> now<00:00:14.190> let<00:00:14.309> me<00:00:14.370> tell<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.639> real

profiles now let me tell you real

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.939 
profiles now let me tell you real
quickly<00:00:15.059> why<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.139> character<00:00:16.529> profile

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
quickly why I think a character profile

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
quickly why I think a character profile
is<00:00:17.130> important<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.930> allows<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
is important first what it allows you to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.620 
is important first what it allows you to
do<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.100> make<00:00:20.400> sure<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.939> your<00:00:21.060> characters

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
do is to make sure that your characters

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.620 
do is to make sure that your characters
are<00:00:21.900> multi-dimensional<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:24.000> solves

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
are multi-dimensional and it solves

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
are multi-dimensional and it solves
those<00:00:24.810> dull<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.500> shallow<00:00:25.859> characters

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
those dull and shallow characters

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.220 
those dull and shallow characters
because<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.449> bringing<00:00:27.660> all<00:00:28.050> this

because you're bringing all this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250 
because you're bringing all this
information<00:00:28.859> together<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.150> page<00:00:30.570> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
information together on just one page so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
information together on just one page so
you<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.529> instantly<00:00:32.009> tell<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> character

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you can instantly tell if a character

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.110 
you can instantly tell if a character
doesn't<00:00:33.329> work<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.530> inspires<00:00:35.130> unique<00:00:35.610> dialogue

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
doesn't work it inspires unique dialogue

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.819 
doesn't work it inspires unique dialogue
because<00:00:36.719> you're<00:00:36.840> getting<00:00:37.110> very<00:00:37.260> precise

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
because you're getting very precise

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
because you're getting very precise
about<00:00:37.860> who<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> character<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.110> each

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
about who that character is so each

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
about who that character is so each

I'm gonna go through and demonstrate

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.580 
I'm gonna go through and demonstrate
every<00:02:15.550> one<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.850> these<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> character<00:02:16.900> but

every one of these with a character but
on<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.860> core<00:02:18.100> traits<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.790> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> get<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
on the core traits you want to get to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.410 
on the core traits you want to get to
who<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.860> character<00:02:21.430> what<00:02:21.820> are<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> three

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
who is that character what are the three

who is that character what are the three
or<00:02:22.660> four<00:02:22.770> things<00:02:23.770> that<00:02:24.420> those<00:02:25.420> traits<00:02:25.870> show<00:02:26.200> up

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
or four things that those traits show up

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.850 
or four things that those traits show up
no<00:02:26.590> matter<00:02:26.770> where<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.310> character<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
no matter where that character is and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.220 
no matter where that character is and
finally<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.040> character<00:02:30.310> subtext<00:02:31.300> now<00:02:31.900> some

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
finally the character subtext now some

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.230 
finally the character subtext now some
people<00:02:32.350> say<00:02:32.530> oh<00:02:33.010> well<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.000> only

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
people say oh well you know you only

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.690 
people say oh well you know you only
have<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> few<00:02:35.080> characters<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.670> I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
have that for a few characters but I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.380 
have that for a few characters but I
believe<00:02:37.000> this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
believe this

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.960 
believe this
pretty<00:02:37.720> much<00:02:37.950> every<00:02:38.950> person<00:02:39.370> out<00:02:39.490> there<00:02:39.760> every

with<00:02:44.350> your<00:02:44.560> main<00:02:44.860> characters<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.670> least<00:02:45.880> those

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
with your main characters at least those

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.690 
with your main characters at least those
top<00:02:46.360> five<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> pretty<00:02:48.160> good<00:02:48.340> idea

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
top five is to have a pretty good idea

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.210 
top five is to have a pretty good idea
of<00:02:48.760> what's<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:50.020> inside<00:02:50.560> them<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
of what's going on inside them and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.240 
of what's going on inside them and
what's<00:02:51.790> their<00:02:52.060> main<00:02:52.390> form<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.990> subtext<00:02:53.680> we

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
what's their main form of subtext we

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.820 
what's their main form of subtext we
will<00:02:54.400> discuss<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.209> future<00:02:55.450> video

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
will discuss that in a future video

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.199 
will discuss that in a future video
where<00:02:56.830> we'll<00:02:56.950> be<00:02:57.070> working<00:02:57.220> specifically<00:02:58.090> with

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
where we'll be working specifically with

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.550 
where we'll be working specifically with
that<00:02:58.540> because<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.290> important<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that because it's so important the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500 
that because it's so important the
optional<00:03:03.100> site<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.550> exactly<00:03:03.970> what<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.270> says

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
optional site is exactly what it says

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.290 
optional site is exactly what it says
it's<00:03:04.840> optional<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.340> what<00:03:06.580> these<00:03:06.760> do<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.090> they

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
it's optional but what these do is they

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.410 
it's optional but what these do is they
fill<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.170> some<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.130> blanks<00:03:09.430> now<00:03:10.180> let<00:03:10.360> me

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
fill in some of the blanks now let me

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.480 
fill in some of the blanks now let me
tell<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:10.630> up<00:03:10.780> front<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:11.380> usually<00:03:12.070> only<00:03:12.190> use

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
tell you up front I usually only use

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.300 
tell you up front I usually only use
three<00:03:13.480> or<00:03:13.600> four<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.470> side<00:03:14.860> I'm<00:03:15.250> not

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
three or four on this side I'm not

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.790 
three or four on this side I'm not
trying<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.820> fill<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.120> every<00:03:16.540> single<00:03:16.930> gap<00:03:17.350> and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
trying to fill in every single gap and

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.620 
trying to fill in every single gap and
you<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.610> worry<00:03:18.850> about<00:03:19.090> having<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.510> be

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
you know and worry about having it be

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.690 
you know and worry about having it be
perfect<00:03:20.080> I'm<00:03:20.350> only<00:03:20.680> looking<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.370> things

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
perfect I'm only looking for the things

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.970 
perfect I'm only looking for the things
that<00:03:21.880> actually<00:03:22.269> will<00:03:22.989> make<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> difference<00:03:23.800> for

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
that actually will make a difference for

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.040 
that actually will make a difference for
this<00:03:24.130> character<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.269> some<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.780> those<00:03:25.870> things

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
this character so some of those things

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.740 
this character so some of those things
could<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.800> flaw<00:03:27.100> or<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.060> character<00:03:28.450> arc

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
could be the flaw or the character arc

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.960 
could be the flaw or the character arc
which<00:03:29.530> isn't<00:03:29.830> present<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.400> every<00:03:30.580> character

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
which isn't present in every character

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.660 
which isn't present in every character
obviously<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:32.350> worldview<00:03:33.190> which<00:03:33.519> is

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
obviously the worldview which is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.400 
obviously the worldview which is
something<00:03:33.940> I'm<00:03:34.150> going<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.330> go<00:03:34.480> into<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
something I'm going to go into in a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.729 
something I'm going to go into in a
future<00:03:35.769> video<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.940> actually<00:03:37.300> has<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.410> look

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
future video that actually has you look

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.229 
future video that actually has you look
at<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> character<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.610> completely

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
at a character from a completely

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.580 
at a character from a completely
different<00:03:40.420> perspective<00:03:41.130> their<00:03:42.130> want<00:03:42.610> or<00:03:42.940> need

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
different perspective their want or need

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.350 
different perspective their want or need
usually<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.680> can<00:03:44.830> tell<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.190> by<00:03:45.459> what<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
usually you can tell that by what the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.180 
usually you can tell that by what the
want<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.170> character<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:47.560> pursuing

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
want is what the character is pursuing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.180 
want is what the character is pursuing
but<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.910> need<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.390> what<00:03:49.660> really<00:03:50.140> they<00:03:50.709> have<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
but the need is what really they have to

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
video set that comes out from this point

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.560 
video set that comes out from this point
on<00:04:38.410> you'll<00:04:38.950> be<00:04:39.130> learning<00:04:39.490> something<00:04:39.970> new<00:04:40.270> that

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
on you'll be learning something new that

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.180 
on you'll be learning something new that
will<00:04:40.720> make<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> significant<00:04:41.620> difference<00:04:41.950> for

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
will make a significant difference for
