weeks<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.790> healing<00:01:12.210> him<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> know

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
weeks of healing him and you know

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320 
weeks of healing him and you know

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
getting in medicine and surgeries and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.990 
getting in medicine and surgeries and
whatnot<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> he's<00:01:16.130> much<00:01:17.130> better<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.700> than<00:01:17.880> he

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
whatnot and he's much better now than he

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.130 
whatnot and he's much better now than he
was<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.750> he<00:01:19.229> still<00:01:20.570> he<00:01:21.570> may<00:01:21.750> limp<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
was but he still he may limp for the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.980 
was but he still he may limp for the
rest<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.380> his<00:01:22.470> life<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.119> looks<00:01:24.390> like

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 

it<00:01:28.740> looks<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.579> maybe<00:01:29.909> possibly

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it looks like he was also maybe possibly

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.200 
it looks like he was also maybe possibly
hit<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.530> he<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> whole<00:01:32.070> leg<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
hit because he the whole leg up to the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.200 
hit because he the whole leg up to the
shoulder<00:01:33.689> doesn't<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> if

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
shoulder doesn't look right so so if

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
shoulder doesn't look right so so if
that's<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> case<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:41.159> may<00:01:41.399> just<00:01:41.430> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that's the case then it may just be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850 
that's the case then it may just be
something<00:01:42.110> he's<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.590> live

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
something he's going to have to live

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.969 
something he's going to have to live
with<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:47.450> it's<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.990> makes<00:01:49.530> me<00:01:49.649> feel<00:01:49.679> like
