station<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.280> configured<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> equipment

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
station I configured all the equipment

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
station I configured all the equipment
this<00:00:54.149> semester<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> work<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.160> if

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this semester to work with it all but if

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
this semester to work with it all but if
anything<00:00:56.670> does<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.149> change<00:00:58.020> anything<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.770> can

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
anything does it change anything you can

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.689 
anything does it change anything you can
use<00:00:59.100> section<00:00:59.489> 4<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.719> reconfigure<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.699> also

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
use section 4 to reconfigure that also

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.149 
use section 4 to reconfigure that also
describes<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.350> radio<00:01:04.350> antenna<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.830> basically

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
describes a radio antenna and basically

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
describes a radio antenna and basically
that<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> set<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that we have because if you set up the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
that we have because if you set up the
base<00:01:07.560> um<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.670> simply<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.180> itself<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.689> has

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
base um just simply by itself it has

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
base um just simply by itself it has
arranged<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.290> 1<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> 2<00:01:10.680> miles<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> need

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
arranged about 1 to 2 miles if you need

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
arranged about 1 to 2 miles if you need
greater<00:01:12.180> range<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> you'll<00:01:13.020> be

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
greater range in that and you'll be

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
greater range in that and you'll be
working<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.590> far<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:13.890> campus<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
working pretty far off campus you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
working pretty far off campus you
actually<00:01:15.150> set<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.479> radio<00:01:15.810> system<00:01:16.200> as

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
actually set up this radio system as

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.850 
actually set up this radio system as
well<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> let's<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:19.619> getting

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
well and so let's go we're getting

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
well and so let's go we're getting
started<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.460> does<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.640> talk<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> how

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
started what does it talk about is how

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.420 
started what does it talk about is how
to<00:01:21.390> assemble<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.930> equipment<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to assemble your equipment on the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
to assemble your equipment on the
equipment<00:01:23.640> functions<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> operation<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.530> how

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
equipment functions in operation on how

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.380 
equipment functions in operation on how
to<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:26.759> practices<00:01:28.340> home<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.240> then

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to use it good practices home and then

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
to use it good practices home and then
moving<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.350> using<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> cs10

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
moving on we have using the cs10

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.179 
moving on we have using the cs10
controller<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> survey<00:01:33.689> using<00:01:33.900> GPS<00:01:34.500> what

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
controller and survey using GPS what

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
controller and survey using GPS what
this<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.520> talk<00:01:35.700> about<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.140> my
