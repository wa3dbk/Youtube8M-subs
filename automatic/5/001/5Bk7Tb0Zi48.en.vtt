00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
applied to the back of the planks before

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.229 
applied to the back of the planks before
we<00:00:37.930> put<00:00:38.469> them<00:00:38.559> on<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.070> framing<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:39.730> then

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
we put them on to the framing and then

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.360 
we put them on to the framing and then
since<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:40.629> time<00:00:41.050> we've<00:00:41.290> applied<00:00:41.649> one<00:00:42.070> more

since that time we've applied one more

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.240 
since that time we've applied one more
coat<00:00:42.699> of<00:00:42.909> 1026<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.110> interior<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.040> boat

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
coat of 1026 to the interior of the boat

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.000 
coat of 1026 to the interior of the boat
as<00:00:45.460> well<00:00:45.670> as<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.089> gunnels<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.260> knees<00:00:47.530> and

as well as the gunnels and the knees and
the<00:00:48.129> inside<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.670> transom<00:00:49.149> so<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.920> had<00:00:51.129> to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
the inside of the transom so we had to

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.430 
the inside of the transom so we had to
prep<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.729> up<00:00:51.850> from<00:00:52.120> Neph<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.659> honest<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.260> what

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
prep it up from Neph of honest and what

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.560 
prep it up from Neph of honest and what
we<00:00:53.559> did<00:00:53.769> on<00:00:53.920> most<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.610> interior<00:00:55.180> was<00:00:55.360> just

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
we did on most of the interior was just

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.460 
we did on most of the interior was just
simply<00:00:55.930> rub<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.860> down<00:00:56.890> with<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> little<00:00:57.939> brown

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
simply rub it down with a little brown

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.560 
simply rub it down with a little brown
scotch<00:00:59.470> brite<00:00:59.799> pad<00:00:59.830> because<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:01.269> original

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
scotch brite pad because the original

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.499 
scotch brite pad because the original
sealer<00:01:02.110> has<00:01:02.350> raised<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.339> grain<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:04.089> between

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
sealer has raised the grain in between

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.660 
sealer has raised the grain in between
the<00:01:04.750> frames<00:01:05.049> and<00:01:05.439> raised<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.009> grain<00:01:06.280> on<00:01:06.549> the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
the frames and raised the grain on the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.760 
the frames and raised the grain on the
frames<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.240> little<00:01:07.270> bit<00:01:07.689> and<00:01:07.930> we<00:01:08.409> didn't<00:01:08.619> want

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
frames a little bit and we didn't want

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.920 
frames a little bit and we didn't want
to<00:01:08.890> use<00:01:09.009> any<00:01:09.250> sandpaper<00:01:10.030> or<00:01:10.210> anything<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.780> get

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
to use any sandpaper or anything to get

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.270 
to use any sandpaper or anything to get
rid<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.350> because<00:01:11.680> we<00:01:11.799> knew<00:01:11.979> we<00:01:12.130> would

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
rid of that because we knew we would

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.280 
rid of that because we knew we would
scratch<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.119> surface<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:13.720> didn't<00:01:13.930> want<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.110> do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
scratch the surface we didn't want to do

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.980 
scratch the surface we didn't want to do
that<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.579> is<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.790> little<00:01:16.360> dinghy<00:01:16.720> that's

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that and this is a little dinghy that's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.749 
that and this is a little dinghy that's
being<00:01:17.200> used<00:01:17.500> all<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.040> time<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:18.430> we<00:01:18.549> still

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
being used all the time but we still

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.580 
being used all the time but we still
trying<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.060> make<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.329> look<00:01:19.720> as<00:01:19.900> nice<00:01:20.110> as<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:20.409> can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
trying to make it look as nice as we can

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.819 
trying to make it look as nice as we can
make<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.920> look<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.750> actually<00:01:22.960> prepped<00:01:23.590> up

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
make it look and we actually prepped up

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.039 
make it look and we actually prepped up
in<00:01:24.009> between<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.399> frames<00:01:24.790> going<00:01:25.420> vertically

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
in between the frames going vertically

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.530 
in between the frames going vertically
against<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.740> grain<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.490> cedar<00:01:27.909> planking

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
against the grain of that cedar planking

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.750 
against the grain of that cedar planking
and<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:29.229> course<00:01:29.500> all<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.400> was<00:01:30.520> done

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
and of course all of it was done

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.490 
and of course all of it was done
vertically<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.450> between<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.050> kind<00:01:32.409> of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
vertically in between and that kind of

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.310 
vertically in between and that kind of
scrubbed<00:01:32.890> off<00:01:33.130> all<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.790> fuzz<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.720> some

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
scrubbed off all of that fuzz and some

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.020 
scrubbed off all of that fuzz and some
of<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.530> little<00:01:35.710> brush<00:01:36.040> hairs<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.729> different

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
of the little brush hairs and different

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.670 
of the little brush hairs and different
things<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.420> were<00:01:37.540> left<00:01:37.690> on<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.290> some<00:01:38.590> of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
things that were left on it on some of

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.430 
things that were left on it on some of
the<00:01:38.770> flat<00:01:39.010> surfaces<00:01:39.640> we<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.030> use<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:41.140> just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
the flat surfaces we also use like just

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.210 
the flat surfaces we also use like just
220<00:01:42.100> paper<00:01:43.000> because<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:44.200> actually<00:01:44.530> makes<00:01:44.799> it's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
220 paper because it actually makes it's

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.480 
220 paper because it actually makes it's
much<00:01:45.460> smoother<00:01:46.330> then<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.710> does<00:01:47.979> this<00:01:48.220> kind

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
much smoother then this does this kind

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.219 
much smoother then this does this kind
of<00:01:48.580> roughs<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.150> surface<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.750> allows<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
of roughs the surface and allows the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.620 
of roughs the surface and allows the
varnish<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.799> stick<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.490> seal<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.760> coat<00:01:52.090> but

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
varnish to stick to the seal of coat but

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.270 
varnish to stick to the seal of coat but
if<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:52.870> want<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:53.260> surface<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.799> be<00:01:53.950> flat

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
if you want that surface to be flat

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.440 
if you want that surface to be flat
you're<00:01:54.520> gonna<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.940> sand<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.360> this

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
you're gonna have to sand it this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.690 
you're gonna have to sand it this
doesn't<00:01:55.690> really<00:01:56.229> flatten<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.830> surface<00:01:57.250> it

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
doesn't really flatten the surface it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.609 
doesn't really flatten the surface it
really<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.150> kind<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.450> preps<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.990> up<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.320> grip

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
really just kind of preps it up to grip

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.950 
really just kind of preps it up to grip
the<00:01:59.830> varnish<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.490> those<00:02:01.210> are<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.510> two<00:02:01.659> things

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
the varnish so those are the two things

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.570 
the varnish so those are the two things
that<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.290> used<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:02.890> after<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.369> was

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that we used and then after that was

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.240 
that we used and then after that was
done<00:02:03.820> we<00:02:04.150> took<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.900> brush<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.440> we<00:02:05.619> brushed<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
done we took a brush and we brushed the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.399 
done we took a brush and we brushed the
inside<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.150> we<00:02:07.240> vacuumed<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.110> and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
inside of it and we vacuumed it and

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.199 
inside of it and we vacuumed it and
cleaned<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.159> everything<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:09.879> could<00:02:10.030> get

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
cleaned out everything that we could get

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.300 
cleaned out everything that we could get
cleaned<00:02:10.479> out<00:02:10.659> by<00:02:10.929> then<00:02:11.170> wipe<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:12.010> down<00:02:12.250> with

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
cleaned out by then wipe it down with

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
cleaned out by then wipe it down with
alcohol<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> rag<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.200> picked<00:02:14.470> up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
alcohol and a rag and that picked up

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.020 
alcohol and a rag and that picked up
quite<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> bit<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.310> after<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.700> was<00:02:15.849> done<00:02:15.970> we

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
quite a bit and after that was done we

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.119 
quite a bit and after that was done we
pick<00:02:16.299> up<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.569> tack<00:02:16.840> cloth<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.560> tacked<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
pick up a tack cloth and we tacked the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.490 
pick up a tack cloth and we tacked the
whole<00:02:18.310> inside<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:19.060> boat<00:02:19.319> vertically<00:02:20.319> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
whole inside of the boat vertically and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.380 
whole inside of the boat vertically and
in<00:02:20.620> between<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.099> frames<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.730> every<00:02:22.120> surface

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
in between the frames and every surface

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.869 
in between the frames and every surface
so<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.959> we'd<00:02:23.080> get<00:02:23.260> every<00:02:23.920> little<00:02:24.099> last<00:02:24.459> bit

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
so that we'd get every little last bit

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.970 
so that we'd get every little last bit
of<00:02:24.909> dust<00:02:25.269> off<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:25.989> all<00:02:26.379> right<00:02:26.560> I've<00:02:26.709> got<00:02:26.739> an

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
of dust off of it all right I've got an

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.910 
of dust off of it all right I've got an
old<00:02:27.189> can<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.610> honest<00:02:28.150> here<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.390> I've

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
old can of honest here and I've

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.830 
old can of honest here and I've
move<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.310> top<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.000> poke<00:02:30.510> some

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
move the top and actually poke some

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.030 
move the top and actually poke some
holes<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:32.510> receiver<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> top<00:02:34.260> around<00:02:34.739> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
holes in receiver for the top around so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.610 
holes in receiver for the top around so
that<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.370> pour<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.840> varnish<00:02:37.260> will<00:02:37.410> run

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
that when I pour it the varnish will run

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.440 
that when I pour it the varnish will run
back<00:02:37.920> down<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.430> holes<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> purpose

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
back down the holes that's the purpose

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.910 
back down the holes that's the purpose
for<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.050> actually<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:40.739> going<00:02:40.890> to

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
for that and actually what I'm going to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.710 
for that and actually what I'm going to
do<00:02:41.069> now<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.700> strain<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.330> through<00:02:42.360> this

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
do now is just strain it through this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.809 
do now is just strain it through this
little<00:02:42.900> strainer<00:02:43.440> into<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.430> quart

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
little strainer into this quart

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.230 
little strainer into this quart
container

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.840 

strain<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> whole<00:02:49.260> thing<00:02:49.710> right<00:02:50.520> through

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
strain the whole thing right through

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
strain the whole thing right through
that<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.870> once<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> fill

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that all at once I don't want to fill

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.610 
that all at once I don't want to fill
the<00:02:54.000> strainer<00:02:54.360> all<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> top

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the strainer all the way up to the top

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.590 
the strainer all the way up to the top
because<00:02:55.860> then<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.490> handle<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.240> strainer

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
because then when I handle the strainer

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.270 
because then when I handle the strainer
would<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.230> over<00:02:58.260> me<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.890> I'm<00:02:59.010> trying<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
would get all over me and I'm trying to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.760 
would get all over me and I'm trying to
avoid<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.690> well<00:03:00.690> there's<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.020> drains<00:03:01.410> down

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
avoid that well there's that drains down

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680 
avoid that well there's that drains down
I'll<00:03:02.070> just<00:03:02.280> keep<00:03:02.460> draining<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.660> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
I'll just keep draining the can here a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240 
I'll just keep draining the can here a
little<00:03:04.020> bit<00:03:04.200> don't<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> set

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
little bit don't know I'm going to set

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.060 
little bit don't know I'm going to set
the<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.580> down<00:03:05.820> right<00:03:06.090> beside<00:03:06.510> me<00:03:06.810> yeah<00:03:07.080> just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
the can down right beside me yeah just

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
the can down right beside me yeah just
shake<00:03:08.370> her<00:03:08.520> up<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.480> we've

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
shake her up here a little bit we've

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.930 
shake her up here a little bit we've
transferred<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.920> strainer<00:03:11.220> back<00:03:11.520> over<00:03:11.820> to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
transferred the strainer back over to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.970 
transferred the strainer back over to
the<00:03:12.060> can<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.500> what<00:03:13.680> we're<00:03:13.800> going<00:03:13.950> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the can and this is what we're going to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250 
the can and this is what we're going to
use<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.430> apply<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.030> boat<00:03:15.240> now<00:03:15.600> I'd<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.110> to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
use to apply to the boat now I'd like to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.870 
use to apply to the boat now I'd like to
show<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.710> brush<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:17.460> going<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.730> use

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
show you the brush that I'm going to use

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.690 
show you the brush that I'm going to use
to<00:03:18.120> apply<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.510> varnish<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> China

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
to apply the varnish now this is a China

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
to apply the varnish now this is a China
bristle<00:03:21.090> brush<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.200> most

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
bristle brush it's not the most

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.590 
bristle brush it's not the most
expensive<00:03:22.830> brush<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.610> world<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:24.480> they

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
expensive brush in the world but they

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.140 
expensive brush in the world but they
work<00:03:24.750> quite<00:03:25.080> nicely<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:26.490> trouble<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.030> them

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
work quite nicely the trouble with them

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.000 
work quite nicely the trouble with them
usually<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.960> they've<00:03:28.140> made<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.530> bristles

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
usually is is they've made the bristles

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.400 
usually is is they've made the bristles
too<00:03:29.580> long<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.390> stiffness<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
too long for the stiffness that the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.280 
too long for the stiffness that the
bristles<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:33.240> have<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> little<00:03:34.170> bit

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
bristles are and you have a little bit

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
bristles are and you have a little bit
of<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.470> hard<00:03:34.680> time<00:03:34.800> moving<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.910> varnish<00:03:36.330> with

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
of a hard time moving the varnish with

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.440 
of a hard time moving the varnish with
one<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.870> these<00:03:36.990> so<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.950> simple<00:03:38.370> cure<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.300> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
one of these so the simple cure for that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050 
one of these so the simple cure for that
is<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.900> box<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.620> bristles<00:03:41.130> up<00:03:41.370> near<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.760> heel

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
is to box the bristles up near the heel

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.640 
is to box the bristles up near the heel
with<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> little<00:03:42.840> bit<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:42.990> tape<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.560> that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
with a little bit of tape and that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.620 
with a little bit of tape and that
allows<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> move<00:03:44.490> your<00:03:44.670> fingers<00:03:45.120> down<00:03:45.330> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
allows you to move your fingers down and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.290 
allows you to move your fingers down and
hold<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.590> without<00:03:46.950> being<00:03:47.370> involved<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
hold it without being involved in the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.120 
hold it without being involved in the
bristles<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.870> spreading<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> bristles<00:03:49.980> when

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
bristles and spreading the bristles when

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.370 
bristles and spreading the bristles when
you<00:03:50.250> squeeze<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.760> brush<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.780> bristles<00:03:52.230> a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
you squeeze the brush the bristles a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.260 
you squeeze the brush the bristles a
little<00:03:52.620> bit<00:03:52.770> corralled<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.670> way<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.120> becomes

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
little bit corralled this way it becomes

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.450 
little bit corralled this way it becomes
a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.690> stiffer<00:03:55.050> at<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> end<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:56.220> allows

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
a little stiffer at the end that allows

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.520 
a little stiffer at the end that allows
you<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> move<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.210> varnish<00:03:57.630> better<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.440> also

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
you to move the varnish better it also

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.620 
you to move the varnish better it also
makes<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.880> varnish<00:04:00.240> doesn't

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
makes it so that the varnish doesn't

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.530 
makes it so that the varnish doesn't
creep<00:04:01.020> up<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.410> bristles<00:04:02.190> quite<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:02.730> fast<00:04:03.210> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
creep up the bristles quite so fast and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.350 
creep up the bristles quite so fast and
so<00:04:03.750> high<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.380> get<00:04:05.010> involved<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.850> heel<00:04:06.150> so

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
so high and get involved in the heel so

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120 
so high and get involved in the heel so
that<00:04:06.750> when<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.140> strip<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.650> tape<00:04:07.890> off

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
that when you strip the tape off

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.430 
that when you strip the tape off
afterwards<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.240> easier<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.960> clean<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
afterwards it's easier to clean the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.200 
afterwards it's easier to clean the
brush<00:04:10.590> out<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.130> mineral<00:04:11.520> spirits<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.060> it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
brush out and mineral spirits and it

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.480 
brush out and mineral spirits and it
would<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.320> hadn't<00:04:13.770> boxed<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.280> like

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
would be if you hadn't boxed it like

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.220 
would be if you hadn't boxed it like
this<00:04:14.670> with<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.060> tape<00:04:15.390> all<00:04:15.750> right<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.020> just

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this with this tape all right I'm just

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.710 
this with this tape all right I'm just
about<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.590> start<00:04:16.950> applying<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.609> varnish<00:04:17.790> and

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
about to start applying the varnish and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.660 
about to start applying the varnish and
I've<00:04:19.230> talked<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.680> over<00:04:20.040> quite<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.520> with

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
I've talked this over quite a bit with

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.910 
I've talked this over quite a bit with
Kenneth<00:04:21.060> about<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> procedure<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.470> it's

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
Kenneth about a procedure because it's

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.590 
Kenneth about a procedure because it's
quite<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> complicated<00:04:23.730> little<00:04:24.270> thing<00:04:24.480> to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
quite a complicated little thing to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.480 
quite a complicated little thing to
varnish<00:04:24.990> actually<00:04:25.470> here<00:04:25.680> there's<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.980> lot<00:04:26.280> of

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
varnish actually here there's a lot of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.490 
varnish actually here there's a lot of
surfaces<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.150> edges<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.960> different<00:04:28.260> things

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
surfaces and edges and different things

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.980 
surfaces and edges and different things
to<00:04:29.190> get<00:04:29.340> around<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.420> wouldn't<00:04:30.840> want

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to get around and you just wouldn't want

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.230 
to get around and you just wouldn't want
to<00:04:31.050> start<00:04:31.470> off<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:31.800> varnish<00:04:32.490> say<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.910> gunnel

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
to start off and varnish say the gunnel

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.030 
to start off and varnish say the gunnel
first<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.050> lean<00:04:34.230> over<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:34.860> there

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
first and have to lean over it so there

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.890 
first and have to lean over it so there
is<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.190> procedure<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.210> Kenneth<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.690> now

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
is a procedure so Kenneth is now

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.620 
is a procedure so Kenneth is now
applying<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.040> varnish<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.670> he's<00:04:39.120> starting

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
applying the varnish and he's starting

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.710 
applying the varnish and he's starting
just<00:04:39.930> under<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> gunnel<00:04:40.920> not<00:04:41.460> where<00:04:42.270> he'd<00:04:42.510> get

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
just under the gunnel not where he'd get

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.360 
just under the gunnel not where he'd get
involved<00:04:43.350> in<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.620> with<00:04:43.770> his<00:04:43.920> shirt<00:04:44.190> or

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
involved in it with his shirt or

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.310 
involved in it with his shirt or
anything<00:04:44.580> like<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.270> he's<00:04:45.360> doing<00:04:45.540> one

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
anything like that and he's doing one

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.160 
anything like that and he's doing one
bay<00:04:46.650> between<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.430> frames<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.750> one

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
bay between the frames and then one

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.690 
bay between the frames and then one
frame

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
frame

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.450 
frame
and<00:04:50.880> making<00:04:51.570> sure<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.110> we<00:04:52.260> don't<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:53.040> lot

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
and making sure that we don't have a lot

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.000 
and making sure that we don't have a lot
of<00:04:53.760> extra<00:04:54.300> varnish<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.930> run<00:04:55.260> out<00:04:55.440> under<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
of extra varnish to run out under the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.770 
of extra varnish to run out under the
seat<00:04:56.220> riser<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:56.820> he'll<00:04:57.000> pick<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.360> on<00:04:57.600> it

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
seat riser then he'll pick up on it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.650 
seat riser then he'll pick up on it
under<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> seat<00:04:58.830> riser<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.490> continue<00:05:00.420> down

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
under the seat riser and continue down

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.290 
under the seat riser and continue down
to<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.530> keel<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.830> we're<00:05:02.130> going<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.880> do<00:05:03.060> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
to the keel and we're going to do the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.650 
to the keel and we're going to do the
entire<00:05:03.750> side<00:05:04.410> first<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.370> then<00:05:05.460> switch<00:05:06.360> over

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
entire side first and then switch over

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.450 
entire side first and then switch over
to<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.900> other<00:05:07.020> side<00:05:07.320> we've<00:05:07.620> decided<00:05:08.040> that<00:05:08.220> we

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
to the other side we've decided that we

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.790 
to the other side we've decided that we
do<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> whole<00:05:09.030> interior<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> boat<00:05:10.170> then

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
do the whole interior of the boat then

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.310 
do the whole interior of the boat then
come<00:05:11.100> around<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.700> work<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.600> transom<00:05:13.140> and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
come around and work on the transom and

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.160 
come around and work on the transom and
do<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.040> gunnels<00:05:14.460> last<00:05:14.820> as<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.870> see<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
do the gunnels last as you can see the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.350 
do the gunnels last as you can see the
way<00:05:16.290> he's<00:05:16.440> applying<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.160> varnish<00:05:17.670> first<00:05:18.120> off

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
way he's applying this varnish first off

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.240 
way he's applying this varnish first off
he's<00:05:18.570> picking<00:05:19.020> up<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.320> right<00:05:19.560> amount<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
he's picking up the right amount and the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.460 
he's picking up the right amount and the
anticipated<00:05:20.940> amount<00:05:21.420> each<00:05:21.690> time<00:05:21.720> on<00:05:22.350> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
anticipated amount each time on the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.830 
anticipated amount each time on the
brush<00:05:22.770> when<00:05:23.040> he<00:05:23.130> goes<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.670> pot<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.690> he's

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
brush when he goes to the pot so he's

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.930 
brush when he goes to the pot so he's
simply<00:05:25.110> dabbing<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.160> side<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.700> pot

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
simply dabbing it on the side of the pot

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.730 
simply dabbing it on the side of the pot
so<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.450> it<00:05:27.570> knocks<00:05:27.870> off<00:05:28.170> a<00:05:28.290> little<00:05:28.440> bit<00:05:28.680> of

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
so that it knocks off a little bit of

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.590 
so that it knocks off a little bit of
the<00:05:28.890> varnish<00:05:29.250> without<00:05:29.550> wiping<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.180> all<00:05:30.360> off

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
the varnish without wiping it all off

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.540 
the varnish without wiping it all off
the<00:05:30.780> brush<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.620> then<00:05:31.710> he's<00:05:31.860> dabbing<00:05:32.400> it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
the brush and then he's dabbing it

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.490 
the brush and then he's dabbing it
around<00:05:32.880> in<00:05:33.150> different<00:05:33.330> spots<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:34.440> he

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
around in different spots so but he

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.280 
around in different spots so but he
doesn't<00:05:34.890> dump<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.790> the<00:05:36.270> varnish<00:05:36.750> off<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
doesn't dump all the varnish off the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.950 
doesn't dump all the varnish off the
brush<00:05:37.530> in<00:05:37.770> one<00:05:38.010> spot<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.850> then<00:05:38.940> have<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.540> move

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
brush in one spot and then have to move

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.650 
brush in one spot and then have to move
it<00:05:40.230> around<00:05:40.350> he's<00:05:41.250> actually<00:05:41.520> distributed<00:05:42.480> it<00:05:42.570> a

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
it around he's actually distributed it a

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.930 
it around he's actually distributed it a
little<00:05:42.900> bit<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.320> then<00:05:43.530> move<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.980> around<00:05:44.070> makes

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
little bit and then move it around makes

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.700 
little bit and then move it around makes
it<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.120> lot<00:05:45.270> easier<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.900> go<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.110> lot<00:05:46.410> faster

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
it a lot easier and go a lot faster

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.370 
it a lot easier and go a lot faster
though<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.940> varnish<00:05:48.390> is<00:05:48.420> like<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:48.960> say<00:05:49.170> it's

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
though the varnish is like I say it's

00:05:49.380 --> 00:06:11.740 
though the varnish is like I say it's
fairly<00:05:49.620> thick<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.570> it's<00:05:51.570> covering<00:05:52.050> fantastic

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.230 

you<00:06:12.110> know<00:06:12.260> it's<00:06:12.500> a<00:06:12.680> it's<00:06:13.250> really<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.610> result<00:06:14.030> of

you know it's a it's really a result of

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.410 
you know it's a it's really a result of

having a brush that's able to move the
varnish<00:06:17.870> a<00:06:18.140> system<00:06:19.100> for<00:06:19.340> going<00:06:19.640> about<00:06:19.910> it<00:06:20.150> and

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
varnish a system for going about it and

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.770 
varnish a system for going about it and
also<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:22.250> know<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.400> feel<00:06:22.820> for<00:06:23.180> it<00:06:23.330> because<00:06:23.630> you

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
also you know a feel for it because you

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.660 
also you know a feel for it because you
have<00:06:23.960> to<00:06:24.170> understand<00:06:24.800> how<00:06:25.040> much<00:06:25.100> varnish

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670

have to understand how much varnish
you're<00:06:25.850> going<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.150> pick<00:06:26.330> up<00:06:26.510> each<00:06:26.720> time<00:06:27.050> how

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
you're going to pick up each time how

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.590 
you're going to pick up each time how

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
much area it's going to cover so that

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600 
much area it's going to cover so that

coat of varnish that we've put on over
the<00:07:02.020> sealer<00:07:02.320> it's<00:07:02.890> probably<00:07:03.370> ultimately

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
the sealer it's probably ultimately

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.150 
the sealer it's probably ultimately
going<00:07:04.180> to<00:07:04.240> get<00:07:04.420> three<00:07:04.750> more<00:07:05.020> coats<00:07:05.380> over<00:07:05.950> this
