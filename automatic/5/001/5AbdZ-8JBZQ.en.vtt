we'll<00:00:25.240> be<00:00:25.359> creating<00:00:25.630> today<00:00:26.080> as<00:00:26.980> soon<00:00:27.099> as<00:00:27.189> your

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
we'll be creating today as soon as your

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.779 
we'll be creating today as soon as your
application<00:00:27.460> loads<00:00:28.269> or<00:00:28.480> view<00:00:29.080> loads<00:00:29.789> your

application loads or view loads your

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.970 
application loads or view loads your
animation<00:00:31.390> starts<00:00:31.990> plane<00:00:34.650> now<00:00:35.650> you'll<00:00:35.800> see

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
animation starts plane now you'll see

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.980 
animation starts plane now you'll see
these<00:00:36.070> on<00:00:36.280> some<00:00:36.490> fancy<00:00:36.790> applications<00:00:37.570> already

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
these on some fancy applications already

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.529 
these on some fancy applications already
out<00:00:38.170> where<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.579> go<00:00:39.700> feed<00:00:39.910> applicational<00:00:40.420> and

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
out where you go feed applicational and

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.690 
out where you go feed applicational and
the<00:00:40.600> menu<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.140> can<00:00:41.200> see<00:00:41.379> graphics<00:00:41.920> moving<00:00:42.460> and

was but for the purpose this tutorial
I'm<00:02:42.290> something<00:02:42.500> getting<00:02:42.620> rid<00:02:42.829> of<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.430> type

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
I'm something getting rid of it and type

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.289 
I'm something getting rid of it and type
out<00:02:44.360> fresh<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.030> after<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
out fresh so just after the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.140 
out fresh so just after the
implementation<00:02:48.099> get<00:02:49.099> enter<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> few<00:02:49.670> times<00:02:49.939> we

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
implementation get enter a few times we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.440 
implementation get enter a few times we
have<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:50.720> fair<00:02:51.470> bit<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.680> room<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.849> I'll<00:02:53.060> zoom<00:02:53.090> in

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
have a fair bit of room and I'll zoom in

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.930 
have a fair bit of room and I'll zoom in
for<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.659> now<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.190> need<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.459> start<00:02:55.700> by

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
for you now so we need to start by

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.610 
for you now so we need to start by
typing<00:02:56.180> -<00:02:57.159> break<00:02:58.159> it<00:02:59.079> void<00:03:02.680> viewdidload<00:03:04.420> space

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
typing - break it void viewdidload space

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.930 
typing - break it void viewdidload space
curly<00:03:06.620> bracket<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.040> hit<00:03:07.159> enter<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.549> few<00:03:07.730> times

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
curly bracket and hit enter a few times

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.110 
curly bracket and hit enter a few times
so<00:03:08.090> we've<00:03:08.239> got<00:03:08.379> something<00:03:09.379> some<00:03:09.739> room<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.250> I

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
so we've got something some room and I

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.629 
so we've got something some room and I
can<00:03:11.269> now<00:03:11.420> start<00:03:11.480> typing<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.230> code<00:03:12.609> for<00:03:13.609> our

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
can now start typing the code for our

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.080 
can now start typing the code for our
animation<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.930> see<00:03:14.959> Dava<00:03:15.409> start<00:03:15.709> by<00:03:15.829> typing

nature it's objects I've been using more

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.819 
nature it's objects I've been using more
than<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:39.799> image<00:03:41.019> it's<00:03:42.019> into<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.349> few<00:03:42.620> times

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
than one image it's into a few times

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.569 
than one image it's into a few times
there<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:44.329> just<00:03:45.160> after<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.459> need

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
there and then just after that we need

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.689 
there and then just after that we need
to<00:03:46.760> know<00:03:46.879> type<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.359> every<00:03:47.959> image<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.699> have

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
to know type in every image we have

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.409 
to know type in every image we have
which<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.150> my<00:03:50.269> case<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.510> have<00:03:50.660> nine<00:03:50.959> set<00:03:51.349> to<00:03:51.440> make

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
which in my case I have nine set to make

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.689 
which in my case I have nine set to make
so<00:03:53.419> I<00:03:53.449> have<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.690> type<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.079> nine<00:03:54.290> images<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.549> to

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
so I have to type in nine images and to

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.789 
so I have to type in nine images and to
do<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.060> do<00:03:56.209> bracket<00:03:57.079> UI<00:03:57.949> image<00:03:59.799> space

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
do that we do bracket UI image space

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.080 
do that we do bracket UI image space
image<00:04:01.370> named<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:04.040> now<00:04:04.159> we<00:04:04.220> type<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.639> our<00:04:04.760> image

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
image named and now we type in our image

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.399 
image named and now we type in our image
in<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.299> name<00:04:06.340> which<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.489> my<00:04:07.669> case<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.329> have<00:04:09.109> nine

all together all names Paul in a number

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.439 
all together all names Paul in a number
gif<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.019> start<00:04:15.379> by<00:04:15.409> typing<00:04:17.799> boom<00:04:18.909> one<00:04:19.909> dot

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
gif so I start by typing boom one dot

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.800 
gif so I start by typing boom one dot
gif<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:22.250> actually<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.820> quotation<00:04:23.539> mark<00:04:23.690> we

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
gif and actually the quotation mark we

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.100 
gif and actually the quotation mark we
do<00:04:23.930> bracket<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.680> then<00:04:24.830> any<00:04:25.099> comment<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:26.110> just

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
do bracket and then any comment I just

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.589 
do bracket and then any comment I just
to<00:04:27.199> save<00:04:27.349> a<00:04:27.380> little<00:04:27.620> bit<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.949> time<00:04:28.479> I'm<00:04:29.479> gonna

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
to save a little bit of time I'm gonna

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.690 
to save a little bit of time I'm gonna
copy<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:29.990> paste<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.349> line<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> have<00:04:31.490> 9

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
copy and paste this line and so I have 9

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.090 
copy and paste this line and so I have 9
or<00:04:31.760> scrovo<00:04:32.120> says<00:04:32.419> one<00:04:32.659> two<00:04:33.200> three

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
or scrovo says one two three

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.010 
or scrovo says one two three
four<00:04:34.370> five<00:04:35.150> six<00:04:35.540> seven<00:04:36.290> eight<00:04:36.500> nine<00:04:38.020> then

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
four five six seven eight nine then

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.290 
four five six seven eight nine then
obviously<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.500> has<00:04:39.590> changed<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.130> numbers<00:04:40.580> so

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
obviously it has changed the numbers so

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.470 
obviously it has changed the numbers so
it<00:04:41.390> plays<00:04:41.570> different<00:04:42.020> images<00:04:42.380> as<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.620> go<00:04:42.770> along

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.970 

okay<00:04:50.480> let's<00:04:50.750> get<00:04:50.840> rid<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.110> nil<00:04:51.410> again<00:04:51.770> at
