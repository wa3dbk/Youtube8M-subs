00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is gonna be D and we're gonna start here

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
is gonna be D and we're gonna start here
on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> fifth<00:00:28.470> fret<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> string<00:00:29.359> move

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
fret on the g string so she has this uh

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.119 
fret on the g string so she has this uh
it's<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> weird<00:00:41.670> picking<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:43.230> rhythm<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it's this weird picking this rhythm so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.560 
it's this weird picking this rhythm so
it's<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.340> be

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:00.700 

and<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:51.100> upstroke<00:00:51.790> so<00:00:51.970> I'll<00:00:52.060> sew<00:00:52.270> that<00:00:52.390> down

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.850 

so<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:01.670> do<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.320> basically<00:01:03.320> we're<00:01:03.800> gonna

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
so we do that and basically we're gonna

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
so we do that and basically we're gonna
move<00:01:04.160> down<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:05.120> second<00:01:05.570> fret

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
move down to the second fret

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
move down to the second fret
hold<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:08.670> structure<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:10.290> just

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
hold your same structure and you're just

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.220 
hold your same structure and you're just
gonna<00:01:10.680> go

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.150 

just<00:01:15.560> slide<00:01:15.950> down<00:01:16.280> your<00:01:16.310> press<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:18.680> then

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
just slide down your press and then

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.190 
just slide down your press and then
you're<00:01:19.280> gonna<00:01:19.370> do<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.610> same<00:01:19.820> rhythm<00:01:20.000> here

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.010 

then<00:01:26.200> basically<00:01:26.619> we're<00:01:26.920> gonna<00:01:27.009> slide<00:01:27.369> back<00:01:27.579> up

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.649 

and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> start<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and then you start over so here it is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:47.590 
and then you start over so here it is
all<00:01:33.869> together

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740 

and<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:49.100> can<00:01:49.220> see<00:01:49.370> sometimes<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:49.970> use<00:01:50.120> my<00:01:50.300> pinky

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
and you can see sometimes I use my pinky

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.930 
and you can see sometimes I use my pinky
to<00:01:51.500> hold<00:01:51.680> down<00:01:51.830> both<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.280> these<00:01:52.400> maybe<00:01:52.700> it's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
to hold down both of these maybe it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.149 
to hold down both of these maybe it's
easier<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.270> keep<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.570> form<00:01:53.900> like<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.770> just

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
easier to keep the form like this just

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.030 
easier to keep the form like this just
because<00:01:55.250> your<00:01:55.460> fingers<00:01:55.760> are<00:01:55.790> made<00:01:56.120> this<00:01:56.270> way

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
because your fingers are made this way

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.600 
because your fingers are made this way
so<00:01:58.040> sometimes<00:01:58.550> I'll<00:01:58.729> do<00:01:58.880> this<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:01.580> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
so sometimes I'll do this so it's a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.200 
so sometimes I'll do this so it's a
little<00:02:01.790> easier

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
little easier

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
little easier
I<00:02:04.400> guess<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:07.100> anything<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.429> works

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I guess you can use anything that works

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
I guess you can use anything that works
for<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> real<00:02:09.959> simple<00:02:10.140> riff<00:02:10.500> uses

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
for you but it's a real simple riff uses

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.650 
for you but it's a real simple riff uses
two<00:02:11.009> chords<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> slide<00:02:12.450> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
two chords and it's just a slide in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.780 
two chords and it's just a slide in
