00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.979
 let's go what defenses are going 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.420
 to see what defense we can put that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.800
 defense is more chinky to only be 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.720
 it moves the bottom part as they can 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.450
 see here is the complement what is 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 the vehicle the defense with stickers like this 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 that we are going to put it in the part 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.500
 good back there's one with fiber 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.940
 carbon and also the other part 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.619
 complementary to the defense with 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.509
 stickers so we 're going to put it on 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.680

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.540
 improved to level 4 the escape let's see 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.750
 what escapes does it have a double 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.570
 because double pipe is also chromed 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.760
 tuned titanium expensive kann that also 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.430
 they are tubes more sporty type and here 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.810
 the ppe the carbon fibers that is a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.710
 to the side we're going to put him and he's 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.300

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.470
 a protective and these bars for 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.149
 labels also with the spotlights that the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 also that if we're not going to put the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.990

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.580
 the horn we are going to put you any 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.830
 that does not matter, do not put a horn on it 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 expensive so they do not spend so much money 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.520
 xenon spots obviously we're going to go to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.360

 It depends on you if you want to put 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.050
 I like that you look at the tubing like that 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.670
 I'm going to put it, I think the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.680
 smoked clear that is having a little bit the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.630
 intubated then if it does not have it there is 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.970
 you put it but well here is the 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.710
 totally fixed vehicle I hope that 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.270
 they like the truth is very chingo more 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.970
 or less took about 300,000 in 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.550
 fix it so the truth looks very 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.890
 ching贸n the light I am to the mother 2 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.900
 It is very cool as the vehicle is 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.360
 good stable medium is controllable 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.180
 this time it's okay it has a bit of 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.770
 very good speed let's see how 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.200
 skip here also with the button to 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.760
 Let's see how it runs not very well 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.320
 straightens very quickly even though 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.610
 after these clips suitcases on the part of 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.560
 upstairs I thought they were going to hinder a 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.940
 little but if he runs too well like this 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.750
 I hope you liked recalls
