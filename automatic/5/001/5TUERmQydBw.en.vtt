I'm<00:00:04.650> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.799> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> make<00:00:05.339> it

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I'm going to show you how to make it

I'm going to show you how to make it
cool<00:00:05.730> Benny<00:00:05.970> Benassi<00:00:06.150> sounding<00:00:06.750> sawtooth

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
cool Benny Benassi sounding sawtooth

cool Benny Benassi sounding sawtooth
synthesizer<00:00:08.450> here's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> preview<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.960> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.510 

bitch<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:38.360> was<00:00:38.540> dope<00:00:38.750> let's<00:00:39.740> find<00:00:40.010> out<00:00:40.220> how

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
bitch that was dope let's find out how

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.560 
bitch that was dope let's find out how
to<00:00:40.580> make<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.120> sound<00:00:41.590> here<00:00:42.590> we<00:00:42.770> go<00:00:43.420> I'm<00:00:44.420> going

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
to make that sound here we go I'm going

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.720 
to make that sound here we go I'm going
to<00:00:44.690> start<00:00:44.960> off<00:00:45.140> with<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.070> little<00:00:46.280> thing<00:00:46.610> I<00:00:46.700> like

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
to start off with a little thing I like

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.030 
to start off with a little thing I like
to<00:00:47.030> call<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.390> Combinator<00:00:47.900> what<00:00:48.590> does<00:00:48.680> this<00:00:48.800> do

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
to call the Combinator what does this do

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.400 
to call the Combinator what does this do
it<00:00:49.310> combines<00:00:49.790> things<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.050> we're<00:00:51.200> going<00:00:51.350> to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
it combines things so we're going to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.260 
it combines things so we're going to
create<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.800> bunch<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.190> different<00:00:52.340> devices<00:00:52.970> in

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
create a bunch of different devices in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.140 
create a bunch of different devices in
here<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:54.190> they<00:00:55.190> will<00:00:55.340> be<00:00:55.460> combined<00:00:55.850> into<00:00:56.059> one

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
here and they will be combined into one

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.960 
here and they will be combined into one
easy<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.750> save<00:00:56.960> Combinator<00:00:57.760> first<00:00:58.760> thing

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
easy to save Combinator first thing

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.650 
easy to save Combinator first thing
you're<00:00:59.090> gonna<00:00:59.180> do<00:00:59.449> make<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.410> mouse<00:01:00.710> drum<00:01:01.010> and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
you're gonna do make a mouse drum and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.990 
you're gonna do make a mouse drum and
that's<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:02.900> you're<00:01:03.050> done<00:01:03.129> I'm<00:01:04.129> kidding<00:01:04.670> you're

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
that's it you're done I'm kidding you're

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.210 
that's it you're done I'm kidding you're
not<00:01:05.150> done<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.530> initial<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.070> have

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
not done you have the initial you have

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.620 
not done you have the initial you have
the<00:01:07.400> first<00:01:07.580> patch<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.030> loads<00:01:08.240> up<00:01:08.420> with

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the first patch that loads up with

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.650 
the first patch that loads up with
strong<00:01:08.899> gonna<00:01:09.110> be<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.850> or<00:01:10.850> something<00:01:11.270> weird

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
strong gonna be this or something weird

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.719 
strong gonna be this or something weird
it<00:01:11.960> might<00:01:12.110> be<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.680> initialized<00:01:13.160> patch<00:01:13.399> but

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
it might be the initialized patch but

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.040 
it might be the initialized patch but
first<00:01:14.030> thing<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.360> want<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.540> do<00:01:14.690> is<00:01:14.810> initialize

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
first thing you want to do is initialize

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.870 
first thing you want to do is initialize
the<00:01:15.380> patch<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:15.800> it's<00:01:15.979> just<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.280> blank<00:01:16.580> mouse

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the patch so it's just the blank mouse

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.430 
the patch so it's just the blank mouse
drum<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.750> literally<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:18.320> have<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> sideways

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
drum you literally just have a sideways

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.960 
drum you literally just have a sideways
so<00:01:21.440> now<00:01:21.649> change<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.369> sine<00:01:22.640> wave<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.180> sawtooth

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
so now change that sine wave to sawtooth

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.790 
so now change that sine wave to sawtooth
16<00:01:25.970> wave<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.920> should<00:01:28.100> sound<00:01:28.220> like<00:01:28.369> this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
16 wave and that should sound like this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.170 
16 wave and that should sound like this
which<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:30.950> pretty<00:01:31.130> dope<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.000> not

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
which is pretty dope but it's not

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.609 
which is pretty dope but it's not
exactly<00:01:32.540> what<00:01:32.720> we're<00:01:32.869> looking<00:01:32.899> for<00:01:33.110> first

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
exactly what we're looking for first

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.230 
exactly what we're looking for first
thing<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:33.920> want<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.430> turn<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.850> motion

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
thing you want to do is turn the motion

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.219 
thing you want to do is turn the motion
down<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:41.090> prevents<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.750> sense<00:01:42.080> we're

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
down this prevents the sense we're

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.200 
down this prevents the sense we're
moving<00:01:42.530> along<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.860> index<00:01:43.190> next<00:01:43.909> we're<00:01:44.119> going

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
moving along the index next we're going

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.700 
moving along the index next we're going
to<00:01:44.270> select<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.630> certain<00:01:44.900> place<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.409> index

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
to select a certain place in the index

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.460 
to select a certain place in the index
where<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:46.610> want<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.000> synthesizer<00:01:47.479> for<00:01:48.320> this

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
where we want the synthesizer for this

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
where we want the synthesizer for this
synth<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.950> gonna<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.520> index<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.390> 41

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.529 

so<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.920> sounds<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.359> just

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
so that sounds pretty good I'm also just

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.300 
so that sounds pretty good I'm also just
going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> drop<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> octave<00:01:58.530> down<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.039> two

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
going to drop the octave down to two

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to drop the octave down to two
this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> bass<00:02:01.939> cool<00:02:02.939> max<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.860> decay

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
this is a bass cool max out the decay

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.359 
this is a bass cool max out the decay
and<00:02:05.610> sustain<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.920> next<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.069> we're<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and sustain here next up we're going to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.210 
and sustain here next up we're going to
activate<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> shaper<00:02:09.479> no<00:02:10.440> idea<00:02:10.830> what<00:02:11.099> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
activate the shaper no idea what this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.809 
activate the shaper no idea what this
really<00:02:11.430> does<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:12.269> does<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:14.519> know<00:02:14.700> it

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
really does it does I just know it

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.190 
really does it does I just know it
sounds<00:02:15.060> cool<00:02:15.299> so<00:02:15.629> we're<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.959> put<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> on

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
sounds cool so we're gonna put it on

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.910 
sounds cool so we're gonna put it on
saturate<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.810> mount<00:02:18.920> 79<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:22.530> sounds<00:02:22.799> cool

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
saturate and mount 79 that sounds cool

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.979 
saturate and mount 79 that sounds cool
all<00:02:23.430> right<00:02:23.670> filter<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.209> take<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.720> off<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
all right filter a take it off the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.640 
all right filter a take it off the
envelope<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.769> guess<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.970> just<00:02:27.569> crank<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
envelope I guess and just crank that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
envelope I guess and just crank that
builder<00:02:29.099> Frank<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.940> filter<00:02:30.239> all<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> way<00:02:30.569> up

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
builder Frank that filter all the way up

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.580 
builder Frank that filter all the way up
all<00:02:30.870> right

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
all right

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.800 
all right
so<00:02:33.590> that's<00:02:33.769> sounding<00:02:34.099> pretty<00:02:34.760> close<00:02:35.180> but

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
so that's sounding pretty close but

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.380 
so that's sounding pretty close but
we've<00:02:35.959> still<00:02:36.080> got<00:02:36.379> some<00:02:36.560> work<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:38.180> cool

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
we've still got some work to do the cool

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.240 
we've still got some work to do the cool
thing<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:38.959> base<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.010> song

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
thing about this base and the song

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.949 
thing about this base and the song
preview<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.480> played<00:02:41.629> is<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.840> it

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
preview that I just played is that it

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.280 
preview that I just played is that it
modulates<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:43.400> shift<00:02:44.180> we're<00:02:44.989> going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.170> do

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
modulates the shift we're going to do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.979 
modulates the shift we're going to do
that<00:02:45.530> using<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.040> modulator<00:02:46.549> first<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.209> when

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
that using the modulator first up when

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.080 
that using the modulator first up when
it<00:02:48.110> take<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.470> shift<00:02:48.829> modulator<00:02:49.610> eat<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.790> shift

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it take the shift modulator eat a shift

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.800 
it take the shift modulator eat a shift
down<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.599> 50<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:52.069> you'll<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.879> what<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.120> does

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.949 

that<00:02:56.810> sounds<00:02:57.110> awesome<00:02:57.260> doesn't<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:58.629> but<00:02:59.629> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
that sounds awesome doesn't it but this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.690 
that sounds awesome doesn't it but this
waveform<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.799> not<00:03:00.980> exactly<00:03:01.400> what<00:03:01.549> we're

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
waveform is not exactly what we're

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.250 
waveform is not exactly what we're
looking<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.180> want<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.629> go<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:03.019> rap<00:03:03.799> rap

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
looking for we want to go like rap rap

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380 
looking for we want to go like rap rap
so<00:03:06.260> choose<00:03:06.769> waveform<00:03:07.310> number<00:03:07.640> 9<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:07.849> think<00:03:08.299> it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
so choose waveform number 9 I think it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.780 
so choose waveform number 9 I think it
is<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.840> curve<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:12.129> that's<00:03:13.129> exactly<00:03:13.370> what

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
is the curve and that's exactly what

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.520 
is the curve and that's exactly what
it'll<00:03:13.940> sound<00:03:14.120> like<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:15.230> we're<00:03:15.379> going<00:03:15.470> to

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
it'll sound like so now we're going to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.860 
it'll sound like so now we're going to
just<00:03:15.739> sink<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.579> right<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> tempo<00:03:17.420> oh<00:03:17.599> by

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
just sink the right to the tempo oh by

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.080 
just sink the right to the tempo oh by
the<00:03:17.900> way<00:03:18.049> this<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:19.129> trip<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.819> track

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the way this is that the trip the track

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.449 
the way this is that the trip the track
preview<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.540> played<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.810> was<00:03:21.500> at<00:03:21.769> 110<00:03:22.430> beats

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
preview I played you was at 110 beats

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.890 
preview I played you was at 110 beats
per<00:03:22.879> minute<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.739> tempo<00:03:25.609> sink<00:03:25.909> rate<00:03:28.690> one<00:03:29.690> eighth

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
per minute so tempo sink rate one eighth

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.150 
per minute so tempo sink rate one eighth
and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040 

we<00:03:33.790> don't<00:03:33.880> want<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.180> repeat<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.780> so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
we don't want to repeat like that so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.930 
we don't want to repeat like that so
we're<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.380> gonna<00:03:35.710> activate<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.490> one<00:03:36.700> shot

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
we're just gonna activate this one shot

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.340 
we're just gonna activate this one shot
button<00:03:37.180> which<00:03:37.390> makes<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.070> only<00:03:39.070> modulate<00:03:39.670> once

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.290 

dope<00:03:44.350> next<00:03:45.220> thing<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:46.000> is

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
dope next thing we're going to do is

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.980 
dope next thing we're going to do is
work<00:03:49.300> on<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.610> vocoder<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.630> don't<00:03:52.780> want<00:03:52.900> to

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
work on the vocoder so you don't want to

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.310 
work on the vocoder so you don't want to
create<00:03:53.230> effects<00:03:54.420> vocoder<00:03:55.420> lucky<00:03:55.930> day<00:03:56.050> does

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
create effects vocoder lucky day does

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.150 
create effects vocoder lucky day does
this<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.000> his<00:03:58.000> presets<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:59.620> really<00:03:59.890> does

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
this in his presets it really does

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.300 
this in his presets it really does
change<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.610> sound<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.910> little<00:04:02.040> when<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.100> first

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
change the sound a little when you first

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.530 
change the sound a little when you first
do<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:03.670> you're<00:04:03.790> not<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.090> hear<00:04:04.180> anything

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
do it you're not going to hear anything

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.970 
do it you're not going to hear anything
you<00:04:04.720> know<00:04:04.840> why<00:04:05.020> because<00:04:05.200> you're<00:04:05.410> in<00:04:05.500> vocoder

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
you know why because you're in vocoder

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.740 
you know why because you're in vocoder
mode<00:04:06.130> that's<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.490> wrong<00:04:06.640> load<00:04:06.880> change<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.660> to

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
mode that's the wrong load change it to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.130 
mode that's the wrong load change it to
equalizer<00:04:08.200> mode<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:12.960> it<00:04:13.960> does

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
equalizer mode as you can see it does

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.050 
equalizer mode as you can see it does
change<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.470> sound<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.830> little<00:04:14.970> changed<00:04:15.970> it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
change the sound a little changed it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.850 
change the sound a little changed it
even<00:04:16.299> more<00:04:16.480> when<00:04:16.540> we<00:04:16.840> turn<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.200> shift<00:04:17.470> up<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
even more when we turn the shift up to

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.039 
even more when we turn the shift up to
28

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
28

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.100 
28
cool<00:04:20.889> now<00:04:21.340> let's<00:04:21.699> do<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.120> equalizer<00:04:22.569> first

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
cool now let's do the equalizer first

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.350 
cool now let's do the equalizer first
one<00:04:23.349> I<00:04:23.560> don't<00:04:24.430> know<00:04:24.490> why<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.090> on<00:04:25.240> this

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
one I don't know why I have to on this

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.080 
one I don't know why I have to on this
synth<00:04:25.599> but<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:25.900> just<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.259> so<00:04:26.530> deal<00:04:26.740> with<00:04:26.889> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
synth but I just do so deal with it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.300 
synth but I just do so deal with it
low-cut<00:04:28.090> always<00:04:28.930> low<00:04:29.110> cut<00:04:29.349> your<00:04:29.620> synthesizers

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
low-cut always low cut your synthesizers

you<00:05:04.360> got<00:05:04.569> the<00:05:04.750> low<00:05:04.990> end<00:05:05.849> boosted<00:05:06.849> nicely<00:05:07.330> next

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
you got the low end boosted nicely next

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.990 
you got the low end boosted nicely next
we're<00:05:08.409> going<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.740> activate<00:05:09.219> parameter<00:05:09.729> three

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
we're going to activate parameter three

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.209 
we're going to activate parameter three
put<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:10.599> on<00:05:10.780> just<00:05:11.349> leave<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.560> frequency<00:05:12.099> where

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
put it on just leave the frequency where

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.119 
put it on just leave the frequency where
it<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.460> but<00:05:13.270> boost<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:13.750> game<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.259> about<00:05:14.469> 8.6

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
it is but boost the game to about 8.6

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:23.189 
it is but boost the game to about 8.6
again<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:17.819> put<00:05:18.819> the<00:05:18.969> cue<00:05:19.210> at<00:05:19.539> 2.8<00:05:22.020> it's<00:05:23.020> gonna

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
again and put the cue at 2.8 it's gonna

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.059 
again and put the cue at 2.8 it's gonna
boost<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:23.590> mids<00:05:25.409> sounds<00:05:26.409> a<00:05:26.469> lot<00:05:26.620> better<00:05:26.680> like

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
boost the mids sounds a lot better like

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.680 
boost the mids sounds a lot better like
that<00:05:27.279> and<00:05:27.490> high<00:05:27.819> shelf<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:28.330> we're<00:05:28.509> just<00:05:28.539> going

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
that and high shelf now we're just going

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.689 
that and high shelf now we're just going
to<00:05:28.870> activate<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.680> frequency<00:05:30.340> all<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.610> way

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
to activate that frequency all the way

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.670 
to activate that frequency all the way
down<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.300> put<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.630> game<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.949> 7.4<00:05:33.719> or<00:05:34.719> nearby

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
down and put the game to 7.4 or nearby

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:45.390 
down and put the game to 7.4 or nearby
and<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:37.090> cue<00:05:37.479> to<00:05:37.810> two<00:05:43.860> so<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:44.979> boosts<00:05:45.310> the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
and the cue to two so that boosts the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.719 
and the cue to two so that boosts the
highs<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:47.650> sounded<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.039> lot<00:05:48.159> better<00:05:48.219> but

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
highs that sounded a lot better but

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.170 
highs that sounded a lot better but
we're<00:05:49.690> just<00:05:49.719> going<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:49.960> activate<00:05:50.229> another

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
we're just going to activate another

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.869 
we're just going to activate another
equalizer<00:05:52.199> and<00:05:53.199> we're<00:05:53.379> gonna<00:05:53.469> turn<00:05:53.860> down<00:05:54.190> the

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
equalizer and we're gonna turn down the

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.790 
equalizer and we're gonna turn down the
lows<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.389> really<00:05:55.930> should<00:05:56.080> just<00:05:56.319> turn<00:05:56.440> down<00:05:56.680> the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
lows I really should just turn down the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.140 
lows I really should just turn down the

I<00:05:58.180> do<00:05:58.270> this<00:05:58.509> but<00:05:59.289> whatever<00:05:59.770> who<00:05:59.949> cares

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180

don't really care parameter 1 or 2

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.390 
don't really care parameter 1 or 2
you're<00:06:14.520> gonna<00:06:14.639> put<00:06:14.909> on<00:06:15.090> 210<00:06:15.569> k<00:06:15.930> hurts<00:06:18.919> Game<00:06:19.919> six

you're gonna put on 210 k hurts Game six

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:29.300 
you're gonna put on 210 k hurts Game six
point<00:06:20.610> nine<00:06:23.090> or<00:06:24.090> 75<00:06:24.870> really<00:06:25.409> good<00:06:25.529> luck<00:06:26.900> q<00:06:28.310> 11.3

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.029 
point nine or 75 really good luck q 11.3
going<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.550> widen<00:06:30.090> up<00:06:30.409> the<00:06:31.409> area<00:06:31.770> that<00:06:31.919> it's

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
going to widen up the area that it's

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:39.980 
going to widen up the area that it's
boosting<00:06:37.909> so<00:06:38.909> that<00:06:39.029> boost<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.389> highs<00:06:39.569> even

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
boosting so that boost the highs even

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:48.409 
boosting so that boost the highs even
more<00:06:40.520> at<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.789> 10k<00:06:42.539> range<00:06:46.759> so<00:06:47.759> that's<00:06:47.969> pretty

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
more at the 10k range so that's pretty

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.689 
more at the 10k range so that's pretty
close<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:48.840> what<00:06:48.960> I<00:06:48.990> had<00:06:49.199> before<00:06:49.379> but<00:06:49.979> the<00:06:50.340> final

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
close to what I had before but the final

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.010 
close to what I had before but the final
touch<00:06:50.909> you're<00:06:51.240> gonna<00:06:51.360> want<00:06:51.569> to<00:06:51.629> add<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.779> little

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
touch you're gonna want to add a little

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.820 
touch you're gonna want to add a little
bit<00:06:52.139> of<00:06:52.199> reverb<00:06:52.550> to<00:06:53.550> just<00:06:53.849> the<00:06:53.969> high<00:06:54.120> end<00:06:54.330> so

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
bit of reverb to just the high end so

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.029 
bit of reverb to just the high end so
create<00:06:55.830> are<00:06:56.300> not<00:06:57.300> our<00:06:57.509> set<00:06:57.779> our<00:06:58.039> v7000

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 
create are not our set our v7000

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.369 
create are not our set our v7000
advanced<00:06:59.400> reverb<00:06:59.759> and<00:06:59.909> at<00:07:00.810> first<00:07:00.990> gonna<00:07:01.229> be

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:01.379 
advanced reverb and at first gonna be

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.550 
advanced reverb and at first gonna be
all<00:07:01.500> the<00:07:01.620> way<00:07:01.740> wet<00:07:02.629> so<00:07:03.629> just<00:07:03.870> turn<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.319> dry/wet

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
all the way wet so just turn the dry/wet

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.200 
all the way wet so just turn the dry/wet
down<00:07:05.039> to<00:07:05.339> let<00:07:05.520> more<00:07:05.759> of<00:07:05.819> the<00:07:05.939> dry<00:07:06.150> signal

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
down to let more of the dry signal

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:12.499 
down to let more of the dry signal
through<00:07:09.800> that<00:07:10.800> sounds<00:07:11.099> pretty<00:07:11.249> boss<00:07:11.520> but<00:07:12.000> we

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
through that sounds pretty boss but we

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.950 
through that sounds pretty boss but we
really<00:07:12.930> don't<00:07:13.050> want<00:07:13.319> the<00:07:14.310> low<00:07:14.520> end<00:07:14.810> to<00:07:15.810> be

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
really don't want the low end to be

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.839 
really don't want the low end to be
reverb<00:07:16.409> so<00:07:16.800> you're<00:07:17.039> gonna<00:07:17.129> activate<00:07:17.699> the

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:17.849 
reverb so you're gonna activate the

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:23.990 
reverb so you're gonna activate the
remote<00:07:18.000> programmer<00:07:18.629> here<00:07:18.979> go<00:07:19.979> to<00:07:20.069> eq<00:07:20.870> and<00:07:23.000> just

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
remote programmer here go to eq and just

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.760 
remote programmer here go to eq and just
cut<00:07:24.270> the<00:07:24.419> lows<00:07:25.009> all<00:07:26.009> the<00:07:26.399> way<00:07:26.490> down<00:07:26.699> and<00:07:27.770> boosts

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
cut the lows all the way down and boosts

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.929 
cut the lows all the way down and boosts
the<00:07:29.310> low-frequency<00:07:29.610> up<00:07:29.969> to<00:07:30.060> like<00:07:30.180> 1000<00:07:31.939> it's

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:32.939 
the low-frequency up to like 1000 it's

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:34.219 
the low-frequency up to like 1000 it's
gonna<00:07:33.060> make<00:07:33.240> sure<00:07:33.419> that<00:07:33.719> only<00:07:33.870> the<00:07:34.020> high

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
gonna make sure that only the high

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.760 
gonna make sure that only the high
frequencies<00:07:35.810> and<00:07:36.810> there<00:07:37.229> you<00:07:37.319> go<00:07:37.439> that's<00:07:37.710> the

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
frequencies and there you go that's the

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.260 
frequencies and there you go that's the
sound<00:07:37.979> I<00:07:38.279> hope<00:07:38.520> you've<00:07:38.729> enjoyed<00:07:38.819> watching
