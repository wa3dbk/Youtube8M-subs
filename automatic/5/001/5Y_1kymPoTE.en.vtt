front of a 1942 Steinway this isn't a
light<00:00:05.819> mahogany<00:00:06.509> finish<00:00:06.690> Brown<00:00:07.400> it<00:00:08.400> was

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
light mahogany finish Brown it was

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060 
light mahogany finish Brown it was
refinished<00:00:09.059> at<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.570> point<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.110> someone<00:00:11.040> that

darker<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> finish<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.429> guess<00:00:14.580> originally<00:00:15.120> but

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
darker the finish I guess originally but

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
you know there was a period during the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.770 
you know there was a period during the
Second<00:03:33.550> World<00:03:33.610> War<00:03:33.820> when<00:03:34.000> there<00:03:34.450> were<00:03:34.570> almost

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
Second World War when there were almost

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.140 
Second World War when there were almost
no<00:03:35.110> automobiles<00:03:35.920> or<00:03:36.220> pianos<00:03:36.670> made<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.060> this

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
no automobiles or pianos made in this

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.790 
no automobiles or pianos made in this
country<00:03:37.209> because<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> factories<00:03:38.290> were<00:03:38.470> taken

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
country because the factories were taken

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.650 
country because the factories were taken
over<00:03:38.890> by<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.220> government<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> make<00:03:40.390> war

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
over by the government to make war

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.770 
over by the government to make war
material<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:42.430> Steinway<00:03:42.880> factory<00:03:43.420> pretty

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
material and the Steinway factory pretty

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.880 
material and the Steinway factory pretty
much<00:03:44.019> ceased<00:03:44.410> production<00:03:44.650> between<00:03:45.430> 42<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.060> 46

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
much ceased production between 42 and 46

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.800 
much ceased production between 42 and 46
so<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:48.040> being<00:03:48.340> made<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.640> 42<00:03:49.150> would<00:03:49.360> be<00:03:49.540> one<00:03:49.720> of

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so this being made in 42 would be one of

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.170 
so this being made in 42 would be one of
the<00:03:49.900> last<00:03:50.050> time<00:03:50.410> ways<00:03:50.620> made<00:03:50.920> before<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.550> they

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
the last time ways made before that they

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.880 
the last time ways made before that they
stopped<00:03:52.510> making<00:03:52.870> pianos<00:03:53.170> during<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.530> Second

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
stopped making pianos during the Second

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.490 
stopped making pianos during the Second
World<00:03:53.920> War<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.820> were<00:03:54.910> they<00:03:55.030> making<00:03:55.500> they

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
World War what were they making they

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.560 
World War what were they making they
were<00:03:56.560> making<00:03:56.890> glider<00:03:57.190> parts<00:03:57.570> Steinway

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
were making glider parts Steinway

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.570 
were making glider parts Steinway
actually<00:03:58.930> made<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.260> gliders<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.310> flew

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
actually made the gliders that that flew

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.650 
actually made the gliders that that flew
into<00:04:00.850> Normandy<00:04:01.300> on<00:04:01.420> d-day<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.269> is<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
into Normandy on d-day so so this is the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.259 
into Normandy on d-day so so this is the
last<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.230> era<00:04:05.440> before<00:04:05.709> pretty<00:04:06.700> much<00:04:06.910> I

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
last of the era before pretty much I

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.640 
last of the era before pretty much I
kind<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.750> think<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.050> this<00:04:08.200> as<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
kind of think of this as like the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.199 
kind of think of this as like the
dividing<00:04:08.950> line<00:04:09.250> between<00:04:09.280> pre-war<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
dividing line between pre-war and

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.290 
dividing line between pre-war and
post-war<00:04:10.530> Steinway<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.370> elegant<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.060> don't

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
post-war Steinway it is elegant I don't

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.640 
post-war Steinway it is elegant I don't
know<00:04:13.360> if<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.570> could<00:04:13.750> hear<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.050> Paul<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:14.620> I
