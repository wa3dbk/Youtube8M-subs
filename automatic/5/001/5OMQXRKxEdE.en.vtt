out<00:04:43.900> here<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:45.280> white<00:04:45.520> line<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:46.060> stop<00:04:46.300> lying<00:04:46.630> to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
out here the white line to stop lying to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.230 
out here the white line to stop lying to
the<00:04:47.020> red<00:04:47.200> light<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.710> can<00:04:48.490> still<00:04:48.700> see<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.000> white

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
the red light I can still see that white

the red light I can still see that white
line<00:04:49.450> over<00:04:49.479> it<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.889> then<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.490> make<00:04:51.850> sure<00:04:51.880> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
line over it and then I make sure that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.110 
line over it and then I make sure that
I'm<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.300> first<00:04:52.630> gear<00:04:52.900> ready<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.350> roll<00:04:53.850> now<00:04:54.850> that

I'm in first gear ready to roll now that

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.090 
I'm in first gear ready to roll now that
I<00:04:55.180> know<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.570> white<00:04:55.750> line<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.169> there<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.650> can<00:04:56.950> go

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
I know the white line is there I can go

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
I know the white line is there I can go
ahead<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.550> nudge<00:04:57.880> up<00:04:58.210> on<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.720> line<00:04:58.960> just<00:05:00.120> and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
ahead and nudge up on that line just and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.360 
ahead and nudge up on that line just and
be<00:05:01.300> ready<00:05:01.510> to
