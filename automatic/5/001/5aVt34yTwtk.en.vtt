00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.220 
down his simulator just gonna get an
initial<00:04:04.739> zealot<00:04:05.310> I'll<00:04:05.430> try<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.700> do<00:04:05.880> kind<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
initial zealot I'll try to do kind of

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.990 
initial zealot I'll try to do kind of
pressure<00:04:07.230> possibly<00:04:08.190> even<00:04:08.280> okay<00:04:08.489> stop<00:04:08.760> notice

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
pressure possibly even okay stop notice

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.280 
pressure possibly even okay stop notice
we're<00:04:09.090> also<00:04:09.239> going<00:04:09.480> down<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.750> location

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
we're also going down that location

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.490 
we're also going down that location
actually<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:12.450> don't<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:13.019> what<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> heck

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
actually and I don't know what the heck

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.990 
actually and I don't know what the heck
he's<00:04:13.739> doing<00:04:13.769> honestly<00:04:14.519> nothing<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.880> look

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
he's doing honestly nothing to look

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.789 
he's doing honestly nothing to look
about<00:04:15.359> it<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:15.900> about<00:04:15.989> it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
about it and think about it

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.270 
about it and think about it
I<00:04:18.440> think<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.680> probably<00:04:19.829> going<00:04:20.129> to<00:04:20.220> be

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
I think this is probably going to be

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.730 
I think this is probably going to be
kind<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> proxy<00:04:21.569> he's<00:04:22.169> gonna<00:04:22.319> start<00:04:22.620> out

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
kind of a proxy he's gonna start out

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.350 
kind of a proxy he's gonna start out
with<00:04:22.770> some<00:04:22.889> proxy<00:04:23.190> zealots<00:04:23.729> sure<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.210> not

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
with some proxy zealots sure I'm not

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.089 
with some proxy zealots sure I'm not
sure<00:04:24.509> if<00:04:24.629> Kannada<00:04:24.960> spotted<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.620> think<00:04:25.979> he

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
sure if Kannada spotted that I think he

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.469 
sure if Kannada spotted that I think he
might<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.430> always<00:04:26.819> coming<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
might have always coming over to the

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.119 
might have always coming over to the
side<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.229> might<00:04:28.409> actually<00:04:28.560> spot<00:04:28.979> this

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
side so you might actually spot this

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.939 
side so you might actually spot this
proxy<00:04:29.699> I<00:04:29.909> know<00:04:30.000> yeah<00:04:30.840> he<00:04:31.050> does<00:04:31.199> spot<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.620> proxy

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
proxy I know yeah he does spot the proxy

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.070 
proxy I know yeah he does spot the proxy
Ernie<00:04:32.159> spots<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.729> proxy<00:04:33.300> cybernetics<00:04:33.870> core

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
Ernie spots this proxy cybernetics core

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.809 
Ernie spots this proxy cybernetics core
he<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.860> tell<00:04:35.009> from<00:04:35.129> his<00:04:35.250> first-person

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
he can tell from his first-person

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.430 
he can tell from his first-person
perspective<00:04:36.300> here<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.990> thought<00:04:37.199> that

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
perspective here so I thought that

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.710 
perspective here so I thought that
backhoe<00:04:37.680> was<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.699> go<00:04:38.819> for<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.449> kind<00:04:39.690> of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
backhoe was going to go for it's kind of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.260 
backhoe was going to go for it's kind of
a<00:04:39.870> proxy<00:04:40.259> goon<00:04:40.710> strategy<00:04:41.370> get<00:04:41.789> some<00:04:42.030> very

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
a proxy goon strategy get some very

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.700 
a proxy goon strategy get some very
early<00:04:42.360> Jew<00:04:42.750> goons<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.169> there<00:04:43.349> and<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.590> would

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
early Jew goons in there and that would

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.260 
early Jew goons in there and that would
definitely<00:04:43.830> help<00:04:44.129> him<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.520> break<00:04:44.789> this<00:04:44.970> wall

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
definitely help him to break this wall

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.110 
definitely help him to break this wall
because<00:04:46.050> always<00:04:46.349> building<00:04:46.680> another<00:04:47.159> pylon

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
because always building another pylon

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.740 
because always building another pylon
here

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
here

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.899 
here
so<00:04:49.169> backer<00:04:49.500> this<00:04:49.889> is<00:04:50.009> some<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.520> most<00:04:50.639> all

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
so backer this is some of the most all

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.360 
so backer this is some of the most all
and<00:04:51.240> cheese<00:04:51.599> I've<00:04:51.900> ever<00:04:52.110> seen<00:04:52.440> he<00:04:52.710> has<00:04:52.830> nothing

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and cheese I've ever seen he has nothing

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.159 
and cheese I've ever seen he has nothing
at<00:04:53.490> home<00:04:53.520> except<00:04:54.060> as<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.270> simulator<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.840> think

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
at home except as a simulator I think

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.529 
at home except as a simulator I think
and<00:04:55.500> he's<00:04:55.710> going<00:04:56.219> to<00:04:56.310> build<00:04:56.430> probably<00:04:56.909> a<00:04:56.940> proxy

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
and he's going to build probably a proxy

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.149 
and he's going to build probably a proxy
robotics<00:04:58.199> facility<00:04:58.349> I<00:04:58.680> think<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.039> going

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
robotics facility I think this is going

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.959 
robotics facility I think this is going
to<00:04:59.219> be<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> proxy<00:04:59.729> robotics<00:05:00.270> from<00:05:00.780> him<00:05:01.280> I'm<00:05:02.280> not

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
to be a proxy robotics from him I'm not

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.879 
to be a proxy robotics from him I'm not
even<00:05:03.270> sure<00:05:03.509> why<00:05:03.719> he<00:05:03.900> built<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.289> cybernetics

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
even sure why he built that cybernetics

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.409 
even sure why he built that cybernetics
core<00:05:05.039> so<00:05:05.280> far<00:05:05.490> out<00:05:05.669> I<00:05:05.699> guess<00:05:05.909> he<00:05:06.030> didn't<00:05:06.330> have

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
core so far out I guess he didn't have

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.300 
core so far out I guess he didn't have
time<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.659> build<00:05:06.840> another<00:05:06.960> pylon<00:05:07.560> inside<00:05:08.190> of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
time to build another pylon inside of

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.680 
time to build another pylon inside of
his<00:05:08.400> main<00:05:08.610> he's<00:05:08.849> trying<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.210> break<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.479> front

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
his main he's trying to break the front

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.850 
his main he's trying to break the front
but<00:05:09.930> he's<00:05:10.050> not<00:05:10.139> going<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.349> be<00:05:10.440> able<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.620> do<00:05:10.770> it

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
but he's not going to be able to do it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.040 
but he's not going to be able to do it
until<00:05:11.069> the<00:05:11.190> Dragoon<00:05:11.490> comes<00:05:11.759> out<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.479> proxy

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
until the Dragoon comes out the proxy

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.499 
until the Dragoon comes out the proxy
robotics<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.009> gonna<00:05:14.159> be<00:05:14.370> super<00:05:14.789> it's

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
robotics this is gonna be super it's

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.200 
robotics this is gonna be super it's
gonna<00:05:15.719> be<00:05:15.840> scouted<00:05:16.409> I<00:05:16.560> think<00:05:17.099> I<00:05:17.340> think<00:05:17.909> cañada

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
gonna be scouted I think I think cañada

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.119 
gonna be scouted I think I think cañada
is<00:05:18.389> going<00:05:18.629> to<00:05:18.719> scout<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.169> proxy<00:05:19.680> robotics

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
is going to scout this proxy robotics

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.980 
is going to scout this proxy robotics
facility<00:05:20.219> yes<00:05:20.699> I<00:05:20.849> think<00:05:20.909> he<00:05:21.180> yeah<00:05:21.509> he<00:05:21.690> Scouts

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
facility yes I think he yeah he Scouts

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.379 
facility yes I think he yeah he Scouts
the<00:05:22.380> proxy<00:05:22.830> robotics<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.400> is<00:05:23.520> insane

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
the proxy robotics this is insane

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.809 
the proxy robotics this is insane
the<00:05:25.229> SUV<00:05:25.560> goes<00:05:25.889> down<00:05:26.130> but<00:05:26.340> he<00:05:26.520> scouted

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
the SUV goes down but he scouted

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.459 
the SUV goes down but he scouted
everything<00:05:27.539> here<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:27.930> he's<00:05:28.050> going<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.349> know

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
everything here so he's going to know

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.459 
everything here so he's going to know
about<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.919> Reavers<00:05:29.219> coming<00:05:29.490> in<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.930> canola<00:05:31.259> is

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
about the Reavers coming in so canola is

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.230 
about the Reavers coming in so canola is
probably<00:05:31.919> working<00:05:32.219> towards<00:05:32.699> his<00:05:32.759> engineering

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
probably working towards his engineering

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120 
probably working towards his engineering
Bay<00:05:33.419> right<00:05:33.659> now<00:05:33.840> even<00:05:34.289> though<00:05:34.620> he's<00:05:34.860> being

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
Bay right now even though he's being

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.640 
Bay right now even though he's being
tackled<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:36.360> much<00:05:36.599> here<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.960> starport<00:05:37.380> coming

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
tackled so much here the starport coming

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.990
