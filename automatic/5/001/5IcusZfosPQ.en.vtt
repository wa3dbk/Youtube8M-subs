in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> weekend<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.690> hard<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.960> gauge

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
in the weekend it's just hard to gauge

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
in the weekend it's just hard to gauge
pro12<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.899> test<00:01:04.140> match<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pro12 to test match that there is a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
pro12 to test match that there is a
quite<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> gap<00:01:06.750> between<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.229> two<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
quite a gap between the two and and the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
quite a gap between the two and and the
players<00:01:10.140> who<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> played<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.860> us<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.130> far<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
players who have played for us so far a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
players who have played for us so far a
very<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> first<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.810> games<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.350> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
very well in the first two games so it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.789 
very well in the first two games so it's
it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> combination<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:14.670> things<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
it's a combination of those two things I

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's a combination of those two things I
expect<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> England<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.729> kick<00:01:17.970> very<00:01:18.210> well

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
expect that England will kick very well

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
expect that England will kick very well
I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.170> Danny<00:01:19.380> Care<00:01:19.650> kicking<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I think with Danny Care kicking from the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
I think with Danny Care kicking from the
base<00:01:20.540> Owen<00:01:21.540> Farrell<00:01:21.900> mixing<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.470> his<00:01:22.619> kicking

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
base Owen Farrell mixing up his kicking

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
base Owen Farrell mixing up his kicking
game<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.430> he's<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> real<00:01:23.880> variety<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
game I think he's got a real variety in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
game I think he's got a real variety in
this<00:01:24.630> kicking<00:01:24.900> game<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.700> from<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> deep

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this kicking game and then from the deep

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.690 
this kicking game and then from the deep
you've<00:01:27.659> got<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.740> long<00:01:28.920> left<00:01:29.159> foot<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> Mike

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you've got the long left foot of Mike

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.050 
you've got the long left foot of Mike
Brown<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> I've<00:01:32.009> no<00:01:32.310> doubt<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
Brown so I've no doubt at all that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
Brown so I've no doubt at all that
they're<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.439> prepared<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they're going to have to be prepared to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.109 
they're going to have to be prepared to
to<00:01:35.430> cover<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> ground<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.420> defend<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:36.990> well

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
to cover the ground and defend very well

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
to cover the ground and defend very well
both<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> ball<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.140> air<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.920> ball

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
both with the ball in the air the ball

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.280 
both with the ball in the air the ball
and<00:01:41.280> behind<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.570> big<00:01:42.750> runners<00:01:43.079> running

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and behind and with big runners running

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.670 
and behind and with big runners running
at<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.090> yo<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.960> fear<00:01:46.170> against<00:01:46.470> Wales

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
at them and yo to be fear against Wales

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.469 
at them and yo to be fear against Wales
I<00:01:46.890> thought<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.369> did<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> reason<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.119> well<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I thought they did that reason we well I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
I thought they did that reason we well I
think<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.860> conference<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> decide<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
think the conference to decide is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.590 
think the conference to decide is
realistic<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:53.180> where's<00:01:54.180> team<00:01:54.450> would

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
realistic I think where's team would

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.380 
realistic I think where's team would
beat<00:01:54.780> last<00:01:55.079> week<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> little<00:01:57.270> bit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
beat last week I think was a little bit

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.429 
beat last week I think was a little bit
after<00:01:57.540> best<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.450> i<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
after best i think and i think it's the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.760 
after best i think and i think it's the
lads<00:02:01.890> realize<00:02:02.340> how<00:02:03.210> big<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> step<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.740> game

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
lads realize how big a step up the game

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.730 
lads realize how big a step up the game
against<00:02:05.430> england<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.590> then

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
against england is going to be and then

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.290 
against england is going to be and then
to<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.979> playing<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.459> Twickenham<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.119> well

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
to be playing them in Twickenham as well

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350 
to be playing them in Twickenham as well
and<00:02:10.489> so<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.520> think<00:02:11.670> there's<00:02:12.000> kind<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and so I think there's kind of a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.430 
and so I think there's kind of a
realistic<00:02:12.690> level

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
realistic level

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
realistic level
of<00:02:13.650> where<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.070> need<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.730> weekend<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of where we need to be the weekend I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.690 
of where we need to be the weekend I
think<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> guys<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.100> good<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.460> can<00:02:17.490> be

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
think the guys know how good we can be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 
think the guys know how good we can be
but<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.110> lot<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> things<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.650> need<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
but there's a lot of things we need to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.820 
but there's a lot of things we need to
