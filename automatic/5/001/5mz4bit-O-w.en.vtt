00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.890
 It is difficult to go on stage for the first time in 27 years this season 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.109
 Infield status 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.489
 It became a topic 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.029
 I was convinced that I wanted to cry in the flow 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.649
 Prices went up 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.620
 Sorry sorry 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.220
 I decided what I wanted to say 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.500
 Currently uncovered 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.440
 what 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.940
 To Kawai 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.830
 It is also java based 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.630
 Learned from it 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.290
 Selling price 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.980
 How can I put it out for each theme 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.450
 Completely within the prefecture 180 from -7 o'clock 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.650
 I'm doing nothing 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.670
 The frustration itself 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 But this is on 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 discussion 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.710
 Even if I try to hold it down with force I always say no 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.260
 I guess 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.130
 Please stop the family of children and more 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.120
 Clearly 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.960
 I can not show you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 Do things as long as you have children without a reason 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.420
 If you decide more than that, it will hold down with force and the tournament adviser says 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.720
 Did not ask 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.880
 First think whether your way is correct 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.540
 The cause of not listening to say 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 There are about 70% and about 70% 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 After college leaving in the university campus 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.009
 Inside 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.310
 But whatever the scale 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.270
 I will pick you up 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 Look at everyone 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.259
 To third place 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.339
 Let's make a fiery fire 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.339
 Go inside and eat with everyone 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.400
 Can't wait 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.529
 It will be forced to defend now 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 Already 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 Thin 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.979
 Good cherry blossoms 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.309
 so 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
 About 3000 small villages 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.389
 Investigate 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.389
 Tohoku Gakuin University 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.449
 It is about this 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.489
 Switch to keynote speech 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.059
 so 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.379
 One hundred thirty four 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 Lock is me 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.279
 One more word 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.699
 I'm sorry 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.509
 I knew 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.989
 head 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.989
 There is a necessary broadcast on the park 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.579
 Where did you meet 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.459
 That day 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.409
 Purchasing stagnation 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.240
 86 years old 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.350
 9th 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.350
 dmr-br500 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.330
 It becomes tax reduction of corporation tax 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.969
 Operated last spring 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.779
 Middle strike 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.110
 Exceed 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
 Furthermore the crew 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.319
 But not 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.900
 Incense
