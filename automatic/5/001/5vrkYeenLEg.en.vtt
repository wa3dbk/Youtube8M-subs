 5 what is this item here that would be the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.149
 capture and capture is as follows 1 bi tem 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.310
 a force for example - one day he 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.560
 It's 50 of life but I can 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.560
 increase I can upgrade in attack 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.240
 in the real life of zombie 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.020
 except that I only upgrade if I 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.020
 kill zombie 1 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.430
 I'm going to kill this one and hope to die 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.520
 and now do Huse 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:32.150
 this item or 12 in the body and I made a 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.150
 catch 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 faithful I captured his body I type 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.090
 catches exclamation catches ó I have 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 the catches I have 79 capture the attack 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.900
 he is - an attack two tries less 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.260
 two is life - 50 and at least one 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.510
 so what is this the other one is of 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.400
 new catch is the number of catches of 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.120
 bodies I captured using the item 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.700
 catch and if you have here 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.110
 attack one is the attack i type 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:16.140
 exclamation to have an actual complaint 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.140
 Even I need a look training. 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.550
 I will say up to 1 to 11 thousand under the plate 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.930
 as I have little attack of up to 1 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.420
 so he attacks little. 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.310
 how will I do to increase the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.870
 my zombie attack or life so much does 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.490
 So I have to go back, I do not know. 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.550
 here I go there in dp 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.800
 I met Andréia here and I'll talk to him. 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.220
 he will exchange capture points for 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 me capture point i want to increase 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.470
 I'll tell you one then I'll tell you there's a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.760
 I increased capture points not 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.130
 catches 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.990
 My attack was less 1 now 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.590
 It happened to 9 I'm going to hit a little bit 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.020
 more 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.330
 I spent 50 capture points had 79 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.310
 so this is where you make you progress 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.810
 do you know npc here he will charge you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.040
 capture points you will use 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.530
 You'll get the capture points. 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:25.270
 using this item in the monster's body and 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:26.710

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.660
 this item 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.810
 so it's time to start from the moment you 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.160
 he died of the plant in the body or 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.940
 zombie that you kill you from the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.729
 body must're dead and you will do 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.849
 a catch for your pet gets more 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.389
 strong 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:52.009
 this is it people basically this 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:57.740

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.849
 can reach five life cases and can 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:06.050
 if it reveals itself or 800 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.709
