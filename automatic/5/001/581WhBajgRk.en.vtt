00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 hi friends in touch pashkin frazer and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.010
 now I want to share a small 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.700
 a little trick it concerns 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.389
 turntable whether it's sinus either 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.609
 simple ordinary flat table 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.240
 expose means detail expose 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.289
 torment you try to catch her 8 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 get around some technological 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.390
 fishing line either hole would seem and kind 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.649
 would all fit but when it comes to 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 setting zero on the indicator on this one 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 here is the indicator it turns out let's say that not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:51.230
 indicator risk comes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.170
 to the desired position any there 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.149
 what is there one degree and how not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.829
 try not twist do not twist anything 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 won't get me in this case it's in 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.539
 In general, everything turns out but just want 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 show a little example of what's possible 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.470
 make to combine 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 indicator risk in order to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 so that you can control degrees 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.979
 I use this one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.759
 thin elastic springy foil 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.280
 the thickness is about 3-4 weave and 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.240
 I put it under this one here 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 clamp chick will be this one indicator i 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 I use it as a clamp and here it is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.689
 way putting up at night at risk 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.259
 I press to the right place 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.220
 this foil directly as needed 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 it was to press this indicator itself into 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.030
 the reconciliation process and this is what we have 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.560
 we have mapping so to say zero 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.759
 points with indicator so 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.979
 get out of when 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.920
 risk does not match the required point 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.900
 such a small trick 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.739
 I hope it is useful to someone thanks for 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.739
 attention goodbye
