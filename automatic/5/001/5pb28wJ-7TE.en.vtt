00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.100
 To ensure that the progress of the base is not lost on Android devices 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
 You need your own equipment and base 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
 And a Google account used in Google Play Games. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.000
 Google Play Games is a universal Android app 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.400
 You can use it to save the progress of the game. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
 And friends in the game 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.700
 Share achievements and experiences. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
 This is my base. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 I have a Google account, but my game is not connected to it yet. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 Make sure my game progress is always saved 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700
 I want to enter my game settings 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 And go to your account, then tap "Google Play Sign In" 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.800
 As you can see, there are currently several accounts on this device in use. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 Therefore, before proceeding to the next step, you must make sure that you have chosen your own account. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 This is very important! 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.500
 This is because in the Island Raiders, your base can only be connected to a Google account. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.800
 That is, it will always be connected to any base that was not connected to the first one you selected. 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000
 The account is connected. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 Commander, your responsibility when defending the base! 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 So tap "Add Account" to create an account 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 Then follow the required steps. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.940
 Or log in with your Google account! 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.200
 I have an account before, so here I choose my account. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 The loading indicator will appear and prompt you with the "Welcome Text". 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.800
 Please make sure that your username is included in this message. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.100
 Now your base is ready to be bombed. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800
 Want to bomb with a shiny new Android device? 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 Or would you like to transfer your base to the device you are using? 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400
 To transfer the base to this device you should first use your Google account. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.030
 Set up the device. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000
 Now I will log in to my account and set my device preferences. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 After the device is started 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 Go to the Play Store and download "The Island Raiders." 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300
 After opening the game, a pop-up window will appear 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.500
 Remind you that the base has been 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
 The Google account you use when setting up your device is connected. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
 Tap “Load” to go to the base, the base should belong to you! 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.300
 Don't worry if you don't see the pop-up window 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.200
 Different Android devices usually work differently. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.599
 Just complete the novice player tutorial and enter the game settings 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.400
 Connect to your Google account as shown previously in this video. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100
 Please double-check that your username is in the "Welcome Text". 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.800
 Don't forget to safely destroy the Black Guard on your Android device. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 Please have your device, base and Google account ready.
