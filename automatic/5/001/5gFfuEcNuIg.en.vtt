hether<00:00:01.949> Gary<00:00:02.490> here<00:00:02.700> again<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.689> video

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hether Gary here again and in this video

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.210 
hether Gary here again and in this video
I<00:00:04.049> want<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> talk<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.009> core

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I want to talk about the core

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.360 
I want to talk about the core
competencies<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.859> thought<00:00:07.859> it'd<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.010> easier<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
competencies I thought it'd be easier to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.560 
competencies I thought it'd be easier to
show<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> slide<00:00:08.940> show<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.269> talk<00:00:09.450> you

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
show you the slide show and talk you

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
show you the slide show and talk you
through<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.889> on<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.490> that's<00:00:11.610> what

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
through that on this one so that's what

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.749 
through that on this one so that's what
we're<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.590> so<00:00:13.590> core<00:00:14.099> competencies

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we're going to do so core competencies

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.829 
we're going to do so core competencies
what<00:00:14.910> are<00:00:15.059> they<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.269> probably<00:00:15.509> heard<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
what are they you probably heard the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.570 
what are they you probably heard the
term<00:00:16.020> before<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.680> they're<00:00:17.279> probably<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
term before and they're probably the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.150 
term before and they're probably the
most<00:00:17.699> important<00:00:18.240> part<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.500> marking<00:00:19.949> sheet

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
most important part of the marking sheet

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.269 
most important part of the marking sheet
on<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> part<00:00:20.820> 3<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:22.020> consist<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> thought

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
on the part 3 and the consist of thought

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630 
on the part 3 and the consist of thought
and<00:00:23.430> identification<00:00:24.920> fault<00:00:25.920> analysis<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and identification fault analysis and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.960 
and identification fault analysis and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
fault correction or remedial action so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
fault correction or remedial action so
I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> go<00:00:30.300> through<00:00:30.510> each<00:00:30.750> part<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
I'm going to go through each part in a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
I'm going to go through each part in a
bit<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> detail<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.520> hopefully<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
bit of detail so that hopefully you can

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
bit of detail so that hopefully you can
understand<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.899> better<00:00:34.370> fault

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
understand it a little better fault

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.840 
understand it a little better fault
identification<00:00:36.770> how<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> spot<00:00:38.219> faults<00:00:38.610> well

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
identification how to spot faults well

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
identification how to spot faults well
you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> spot<00:00:39.690> faults<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> lot<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
you can spot faults in a lot of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.430 
you can spot faults in a lot of
different<00:00:40.710> ways<00:00:41.660> make<00:00:42.660> sure<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.320> all

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
different ways make sure first of all

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.110 
different ways make sure first of all
that<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.850> something

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that you know how to do something

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.040 
that you know how to do something
correctly<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.550> apasher<00:00:47.850> part<00:00:48.149> 2

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
correctly so you will apasher part 2

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.420 
correctly so you will apasher part 2
hopefully<00:00:49.680> it'll<00:00:49.860> kept<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.160> driving

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
hopefully it'll kept your driving

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
hopefully it'll kept your driving
standards<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.090> part<00:00:51.329> 2<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> need<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
standards up to part 2 but you need to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.369 
standards up to part 2 but you need to
be<00:00:52.920> conscious<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.750> something<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
be conscious of how you do something and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
be conscious of how you do something and
why<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
why you do it and when you do it in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
why you do it and when you do it in
order<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> support<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> Fault<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:00.059> people's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
order to support a Fault in a people's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
order to support a Fault in a people's
driving<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.289> they're<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.949> doing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
driving if they're not actually doing

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
driving if they're not actually doing
what<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.180> doing<00:01:03.229> then<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
what you would be doing then it's a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
what you would be doing then it's a
fault<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.369> compare<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> against<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.330> own

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
fault so compare it against your own

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
fault so compare it against your own
driving<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.260> sure<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> do

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
driving and make sure you know how to do

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.510 
driving and make sure you know how to do
something<00:01:09.090> correctly<00:01:10.310> compared<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
something correctly compared with your

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
something correctly compared with your
own<00:01:11.610> driving<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.510> said<00:01:13.369> pupil

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
own driving like have just said pupil

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
own driving like have just said pupil
observation<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.090> important<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:16.320> ok

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
observation is very important it's ok

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.899 
observation is very important it's ok
given<00:01:16.890> instructions<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.490> instructions

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
given instructions your instructions

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.149 
given instructions your instructions
might<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.330> perfect<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> might<00:01:19.860> excel<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
might be perfect and you might excel in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.999 
might be perfect and you might excel in
exactly<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.259> but<00:01:22.259> unless<00:01:22.860> you're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
exactly what to do but unless you're

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
exactly what to do but unless you're
looking<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.360> whether

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
looking at them you don't know whether

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.670 
looking at them you don't know whether
they're<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.750> doing<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
they're actually doing it or not and you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
they're actually doing it or not and you
can't<00:01:25.920> trust<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> pupil<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.909> something

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
can't trust the pupil to do something

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
can't trust the pupil to do something
just<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:27.810> you've<00:01:28.170> said<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.820> make<00:01:29.820> sure

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just because you've said it so make sure

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520 
just because you've said it so make sure
that<00:01:30.150> you're<00:01:30.270> watching<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> pupil<00:01:31.020> very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that you're watching the pupil very

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.460 
that you're watching the pupil very
carefully<00:01:32.299> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.630> times<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.320> will

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
carefully at the right times and I will

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
carefully at the right times and I will
go<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.740> pupil<00:01:35.579> observation<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.450> separate

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
go into pupil observation in a separate

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
go into pupil observation in a separate
video<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.560> explain<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.009> how<00:01:38.340> best<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
video to explain about how best to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.679 
video to explain about how best to
observe<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> pupil<00:01:40.909> use<00:01:41.909> your<00:01:42.060> instincts<00:01:42.540> as

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
observe the pupil use your instincts as

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.350 
observe the pupil use your instincts as
well<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.890> does<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.009> mean<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.850> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
well so what does that mean well if you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.730 
well so what does that mean well if you
had<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.630> eyes<00:01:45.750> shut<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> you're<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
had your eyes shut and you're a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
passenger driving along you can actually

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
passenger driving along you can actually

don't<00:01:50.040> feel<00:01:50.189> quite<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.600> relax

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
don't feel quite right if you just relax

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
don't feel quite right if you just relax
and<00:01:53.180> close<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.240> eyes<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.340> what

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and close your eyes and think about what

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
and close your eyes and think about what
it<00:01:56.430> feels<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.790> does<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.149> feel<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> gear

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it feels like does it feel like the gear

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
it feels like does it feel like the gear
changes<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.560> rough<00:01:58.740> does<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> feel<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
changes are rough does it feel like the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
changes are rough does it feel like the
braking<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.240> harsh<00:02:00.530> accelerations

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
braking is very harsh accelerations

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.170 
braking is very harsh accelerations
harsh<00:02:01.799> does<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> feel<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.030> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
harsh does it feel like when you go

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.760 
harsh does it feel like when you go
around<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.420> corner<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.259> doesn't<00:02:04.500> feel<00:02:04.590> quite

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
around a corner it doesn't feel quite

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
around a corner it doesn't feel quite
stable<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> bit<00:02:05.610> fast<00:02:06.409> everything<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
stable or a bit fast everything like

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
stable or a bit fast everything like
that<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.310> instincts<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.629> feel

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that you can use your instincts to feel

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.669 
that you can use your instincts to feel
and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.099 
and
you<00:02:10.769> wouldn't<00:02:11.039> need<00:02:11.219> to<00:02:11.879> particularly<00:02:12.540> look

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
you wouldn't need to particularly look

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.550 
you wouldn't need to particularly look
at<00:02:13.200> anything<00:02:14.090> because<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.390> tell<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
at anything because you can tell that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.770 
at anything because you can tell that
something's<00:02:17.040> wrong<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.909> use<00:02:18.269> your<00:02:18.420> instinct

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
something's wrong so use your instinct

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.390 
something's wrong so use your instinct
just<00:02:18.810> take<00:02:19.530> your<00:02:19.650> time<00:02:19.769> relax<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.370> I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
just take your time relax with it I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.099 
just take your time relax with it I
think<00:02:20.640> when<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.939> tense<00:02:21.120> up<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.689> easy<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
think when you tense up it's easy to

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.530 
think when you tense up it's easy to
miss<00:02:22.260> things<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.370> relax<00:02:24.269> as

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
miss things like that so just relax as

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.879 
miss things like that so just relax as
you're<00:02:25.730> instructing<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.109> try<00:02:28.109> and<00:02:28.260> use<00:02:28.769> your

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
you're instructing and try and use your

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.940 
you're instructing and try and use your
instincts<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> find<00:02:29.549> faults<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:29.969> well<00:02:30.950> also

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
instincts to find faults as well also

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.009 
instincts to find faults as well also
you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.250> find<00:02:32.400> faults<00:02:32.730> by<00:02:32.879> asking<00:02:33.599> questions

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
you can find faults by asking questions

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.330 
you can find faults by asking questions
so<00:02:35.120> particularly<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.329> second<00:02:36.689> phase<00:02:37.340> you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
so particularly on second phase you

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.459 
so particularly on second phase you
might<00:02:38.549> look<00:02:38.819> at<00:02:38.939> it<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.599> drive<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.139> think<00:02:40.319> it

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
might look at it the drive and think it

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.899 
might look at it the drive and think it
looks<00:02:40.650> pretty<00:02:40.769> good<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.250> unless<00:02:41.730> you're

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
looks pretty good but unless you're

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.699 
looks pretty good but unless you're
asking<00:02:42.139> questions<00:02:43.139> you<00:02:43.349> wouldn't<00:02:43.590> really

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
asking questions you wouldn't really

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.349 
asking questions you wouldn't really
know<00:02:43.799> what<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.129> people<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.519> thinking<00:02:44.909> and

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
know what the people was thinking and

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.309 
know what the people was thinking and
you<00:02:45.480> might<00:02:45.599> be<00:02:45.689> thinking<00:02:45.720> something's

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
you might be thinking something's

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.199 
you might be thinking something's
something<00:02:46.859> totally<00:02:47.069> different<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.120> they

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
something totally different to what they

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.270 
something totally different to what they
should<00:02:48.389> be<00:02:48.480> thinking<00:02:48.510> or<00:02:49.079> what<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.620> presume

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
should be thinking or what you presume

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.920 
should be thinking or what you presume
they're<00:02:50.459> thinking<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.419> by<00:02:51.569> asking<00:02:51.810> questions

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
they're thinking so by asking questions

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.990 
they're thinking so by asking questions
you<00:02:52.709> might<00:02:52.889> be<00:02:53.010> able<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.280> find<00:02:53.489> faults<00:02:53.849> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you might be able to find faults that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.490 
you might be able to find faults that
way<00:02:54.859> for<00:02:55.859> analysis<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:58.049> what<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.290> fault

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
way for analysis so what is fault

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.970 
way for analysis so what is fault
analysis<00:02:59.010> well<00:02:59.669> fault<00:03:00.329> analysis<00:03:00.719> is<00:03:00.980> finding

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
analysis well fault analysis is finding

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.979 
analysis well fault analysis is finding
the<00:03:02.099> reason<00:03:02.430> behind<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.969> fault<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.629> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
the reason behind the fault that the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.979 
the reason behind the fault that the
faults<00:03:04.319> are<00:03:04.409> aid<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> cause<00:03:04.919> of<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
faults are aid the cause of it

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.629 
faults are aid the cause of it
this<00:03:06.989> could<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.379> down<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> psychomotor<00:03:08.280> skills

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
this could be down to psychomotor skills

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.479 
this could be down to psychomotor skills
physical<00:03:09.150> ability<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.469> on<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.829> first<00:03:11.099> phase<00:03:11.280> in

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
physical ability so on a first phase in

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.979 
physical ability so on a first phase in
particular<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.150> pupils<00:03:12.510> not<00:03:12.689> got<00:03:12.840> very

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
particular when the pupils not got very

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.069 
particular when the pupils not got very
much<00:03:14.090> physical<00:03:15.090> ability<00:03:15.419> to<00:03:15.510> drive<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.870> car

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
much physical ability to drive the car

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.199 
much physical ability to drive the car
then<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.979> could<00:03:17.159> be<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> cause<00:03:17.579> of<00:03:17.879> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
then that could be the cause of the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.280 
then that could be the cause of the
fault

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
fault

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.789 
fault
could<00:03:19.919> also<00:03:20.069> be<00:03:20.250> cognitive<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:21.000> knowledge<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
could also be cognitive or knowledge and

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.580 
could also be cognitive or knowledge and
understanding<00:03:23.430> reasons<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.599> if<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.260> pupil

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
understanding reasons so if the pupil

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.140 
understanding reasons so if the pupil
doesn't<00:03:25.859> know<00:03:26.340> about<00:03:26.579> something<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.060> they

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
doesn't know about something or they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.539 
doesn't know about something or they
don't<00:03:27.239> fully<00:03:27.540> understand<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.229> then<00:03:28.829> that

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
don't fully understand it then that

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.219 
don't fully understand it then that
could<00:03:29.729> cause<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> fault<00:03:30.299> as<00:03:30.479> well<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:31.139> that's

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
could cause the fault as well and that's

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.740 
could cause the fault as well and that's
what<00:03:31.439> we<00:03:31.530> call<00:03:31.650> cognitive<00:03:31.889> or<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:33.510> could<00:03:33.659> be

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
what we call cognitive or it could be

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.539 
what we call cognitive or it could be
behavioral<00:03:34.049> could<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.859> attitude<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:35.400> might

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
behavioral could be attitude they might

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.179 
behavioral could be attitude they might
know<00:03:35.729> perfectly<00:03:36.120> well<00:03:36.439> how<00:03:37.439> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.739> something

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
know perfectly well how to do something

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.219 
know perfectly well how to do something
and<00:03:38.370> they've<00:03:39.209> been<00:03:39.359> taught<00:03:39.569> why<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.079> should

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
and they've been taught why they should

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.199 
and they've been taught why they should
do<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:40.979> that<00:03:41.189> issue<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.699> well<00:03:41.939> I<00:03:42.150> just

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
do it but that issue it is well I just

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.809 
do it but that issue it is well I just
can't<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.810> order<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.109> do<00:03:43.229> it<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.470> that

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
can't the order to do it like that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.670 
can't the order to do it like that
so<00:03:44.819> attitude<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.930> probably<00:03:46.169> one<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.349> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
so attitude is probably one of the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.860 
so attitude is probably one of the
hardest<00:03:47.129> things<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.519> change<00:03:47.790> with<00:03:48.479> the<00:03:48.569> pupil

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
hardest things to change with the pupil

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.509 
hardest things to change with the pupil
what<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.739> one<00:03:49.949> of<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.099> things<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.459> you

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
what it is one of the things that you

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.399 
what it is one of the things that you
might<00:03:50.639> have<00:03:50.699> to<00:03:50.879> come<00:03:51.030> across<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.019> there<00:03:52.259> could

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
might have to come across so there could

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.149 
might have to come across so there could
be<00:03:52.609> some<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.729> the<00:03:53.819> key<00:03:54.109> reasons<00:03:55.109> why<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.859> fault

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
be some of the key reasons why the fault

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.719 
be some of the key reasons why the fault
was<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.870> when<00:03:57.870> you're<00:03:57.989> analyzing<00:03:58.729> you

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
was there and when you're analyzing you

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.929 
was there and when you're analyzing you
need<00:03:59.879> to<00:04:00.030> never<00:04:00.720> assume<00:04:01.459> because<00:04:02.459> he<00:04:02.639> makes<00:04:02.819> an

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
need to never assume because he makes an

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.170 
need to never assume because he makes an
ass<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.599> at<00:04:03.720> me<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:05.129> always<00:04:05.310> find<00:04:05.970> out

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
ass out of you at me and always find out

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.909 
ass out of you at me and always find out
from<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.509> pupil<00:04:06.870> what<00:04:07.199> they're<00:04:07.349> thinking<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
from the pupil what they're thinking and

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.649 
from the pupil what they're thinking and

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
what they know what they understand

what they know what they understand
about<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.290> try<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.220> change<00:04:11.549> their

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
about it and try and change their

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.240 
about it and try and change their
attitude<00:04:13.169> about<00:04:13.290> something<00:04:13.829> if<00:04:13.919> that's<00:04:14.129> the

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
attitude about something if that's the

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.129 
attitude about something if that's the
problem

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
problem

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.499 
problem
poor<00:04:16.139> instruction<00:04:16.650> also<00:04:16.979> causes<00:04:17.549> faults<00:04:17.909> so

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
poor instruction also causes faults so

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.959 
poor instruction also causes faults so
the<00:04:19.440> analysis<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.099> fault<00:04:20.310> could<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.700> it

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
the analysis of the fault could be it

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.110 
the analysis of the fault could be it
was<00:04:21.060> your<00:04:21.359> fault

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
was your fault

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.700 
was your fault
and<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:23.169> don't<00:04:23.350> give<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.620> right

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
and if you don't give the right

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.260 
and if you don't give the right
instructions<00:04:24.280> at<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.610> right<00:04:24.820> time<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.210> I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
instructions at the right time and I

have covered instructions and positive

and proactive instructions in a separate
video<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.190> look<00:04:30.729> out<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:31.290> but<00:04:32.290> if

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
video so look out for that one but if

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.810 
video so look out for that one but if
you're<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:32.590> using<00:04:32.770> positive<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.639> proactive

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
you're not using positive and proactive

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.909 
you're not using positive and proactive
instruction<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.960> can<00:04:35.139> quite<00:04:35.380> easily<00:04:35.560> cause

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
instruction that can quite easily cause

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.980 
instruction that can quite easily cause
false<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.300> marking<00:04:37.630> sheet<00:04:37.840> the

false and so on the marking sheet the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.900 
false and so on the marking sheet the
examiner<00:04:38.380> would<00:04:38.470> mark<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:38.919> down<00:04:39.100> as<00:04:39.160> faults

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
examiner would mark that down as faults

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.050 
examiner would mark that down as faults
that<00:04:40.090> were<00:04:40.270> occurring<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:42.400> shouldn't<00:04:42.850> have

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
that were occurring but shouldn't have

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.270 
that were occurring but shouldn't have
occurred<00:04:43.449> in<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.690> first<00:04:43.900> place<00:04:44.110> because<00:04:44.800> you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
occurred in the first place because you

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.530 
occurred in the first place because you
know<00:04:45.370> struction<00:04:45.729> wasn't<00:04:46.000> good<00:04:46.120> enough<00:04:46.150> so

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
know struction wasn't good enough so

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.760 
know struction wasn't good enough so
you'd<00:04:46.900> see<00:04:47.729> for<00:04:48.729> identification<00:04:49.389> would<00:04:49.510> be

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
you'd see for identification would be

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.040 
you'd see for identification would be
quite<00:04:50.770> poor<00:04:51.120> analysis<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.300> poor<00:04:52.540> public

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
quite poor analysis of a poor public

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.600 
quite poor analysis of a poor public
correction<00:04:53.560> would<00:04:53.650> as<00:04:53.800> well<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.130> then

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
correction would as well and then

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.040 
correction would as well and then
further<00:04:54.970> down<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.300> sheet<00:04:55.479> you've<00:04:55.660> got<00:04:55.810> level

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
further down the sheet you've got level

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
sure that your instruction is good and

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.070 
sure that your instruction is good and
that<00:05:03.610> will<00:05:03.789> prevent<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.270> faults<00:05:04.570> rather<00:05:04.870> than

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
that will prevent the faults rather than

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.400 
that will prevent the faults rather than
call<00:05:05.260> them<00:05:05.410> faults<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:07.510> fault<00:05:07.750> correction<00:05:08.229> now

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
call them faults so fault correction now

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.230 
call them faults so fault correction now
once<00:05:09.100> we've<00:05:09.250> seen<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.520> fault<00:05:09.729> we've<00:05:09.850> analyzed

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
once we've seen the fault we've analyzed

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.210 
once we've seen the fault we've analyzed
it<00:05:10.389> correctly<00:05:10.690> we<00:05:11.380> know<00:05:11.500> why<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.740> happened

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
it correctly we know why it happened

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.000 
it correctly we know why it happened
then<00:05:12.669> we<00:05:12.760> need<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.030> collect<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.510> so<00:05:14.010> the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
then we need to collect it so the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.760 
then we need to collect it so the
analysis<00:05:15.400> must<00:05:15.580> be<00:05:15.729> correct<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:17.410> level<00:05:17.680> of

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
analysis must be correct the level of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.680 
analysis must be correct the level of
instruction<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:18.970> use<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.389> correct<00:05:19.479> the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
instruction that you use to correct the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.330 
instruction that you use to correct the
fault<00:05:19.930> depends<00:05:20.350> on<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.530> level<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.919> pupil

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
fault depends on the level of the pupil

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.490 
fault depends on the level of the pupil
but<00:05:21.370> generally<00:05:22.300> speaking<00:05:22.360> if<00:05:22.960> it's<00:05:23.289> first

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
but generally speaking if it's first

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.200 
but generally speaking if it's first
phase<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.100> would<00:05:24.430> go<00:05:24.550> back<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:24.789> guided

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
phase you would go back to guided

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.120 
phase you would go back to guided
instruction<00:05:25.449> and<00:05:26.380> guide<00:05:26.650> them<00:05:26.860> through<00:05:26.889> it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
instruction and guide them through it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.420 
instruction and guide them through it
then<00:05:27.580> move<00:05:27.789> on<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:27.940> prompted<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:28.860> if<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:30.190> can

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
then move on to prompted and if you can

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.520 
then move on to prompted and if you can
you<00:05:30.669> could<00:05:30.849> pass<00:05:31.389> it<00:05:31.539> over<00:05:31.599> to<00:05:31.750> them<00:05:31.990> as

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
you could pass it over to them as

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.440 
you could pass it over to them as
independent<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.370> usually<00:05:34.060> you're<00:05:34.210> gonna<00:05:34.270> be

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
independent but usually you're gonna be

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.270 
independent but usually you're gonna be
using<00:05:34.660> guided<00:05:34.840> and<00:05:35.110> prompted<00:05:35.470> on<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.889> second

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
using guided and prompted on a second

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.920 
using guided and prompted on a second
phase<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.970> might<00:05:37.240> be<00:05:37.419> that<00:05:37.539> you're<00:05:37.690> just<00:05:37.840> using

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
phase it might be that you're just using

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.650 
phase it might be that you're just using
a<00:05:38.410> few<00:05:39.160> more<00:05:39.280> questions<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.389> people

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
a few more questions and the people

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.060 
a few more questions and the people
might<00:05:40.840> then<00:05:41.110> be<00:05:41.229> able<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.530> manage<00:05:41.740> it<00:05:41.830> on<00:05:41.950> their

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
might then be able to manage it on their

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.190 
might then be able to manage it on their
own<00:05:42.160> but<00:05:42.340> there<00:05:42.760> are<00:05:42.849> times<00:05:43.090> if<00:05:43.599> it's<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:43.870> habit

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
own but there are times if it's a habit

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.050 
own but there are times if it's a habit
in<00:05:44.320> particular<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.460> pupil<00:05:45.760> is<00:05:45.820> going<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
in particular that the pupil is going to

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.219 
in particular that the pupil is going to
need<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.450> go<00:05:46.570> back<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:46.810> guided

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
need you to go back to guided

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.100 
need you to go back to guided
instruction<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:48.280> don't<00:05:48.460> be<00:05:48.550> afraid<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:49.930> going

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
instruction so don't be afraid of going

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.320 
instruction so don't be afraid of going
back<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.470> guidance<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:51.099> a<00:05:51.160> second<00:05:51.520> phase<00:05:51.729> a<00:05:52.000> lot

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
back to guidance on a second phase a lot

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.270 
back to guidance on a second phase a lot
of<00:05:52.419> people<00:05:52.660> think<00:05:52.900> about<00:05:52.990> that<00:05:53.740> being<00:05:53.919> over

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
of people think about that being over

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.610 
of people think about that being over
instruction<00:05:54.990> but<00:05:55.990> it's<00:05:56.139> not<00:05:56.349> if<00:05:56.500> it's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
instruction but it's not if it's

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.770 
instruction but it's not if it's
relevant<00:05:56.919> and<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:57.310> necessary<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.970> again<00:05:58.630> in

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
relevant and it's necessary and again in

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.170 
relevant and it's necessary and again in
another<00:05:58.900> video<00:05:59.289> I'll<00:05:59.500> talk<00:05:59.650> about<00:06:00.120> over<00:06:01.120> an

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
another video I'll talk about over an

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.469 
another video I'll talk about over an
instruction<00:06:01.660> and<00:06:02.250> hopefully<00:06:03.360> explain<00:06:04.360> that

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
instruction and hopefully explain that

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.279 
instruction and hopefully explain that
in<00:06:04.570> a<00:06:04.599> bit<00:06:04.630> more<00:06:04.810> detail<00:06:06.720> use<00:06:07.720> questions<00:06:08.169> as

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
in a bit more detail use questions as

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.980 
in a bit more detail use questions as
well<00:06:08.440> to<00:06:08.680> correct<00:06:09.340> faults<00:06:09.699> this<00:06:10.599> is<00:06:10.780> mainly

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
well to correct faults this is mainly

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.839 
well to correct faults this is mainly
again<00:06:11.560> on<00:06:11.680> second<00:06:12.010> phase<00:06:12.220> but<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:12.580> can<00:06:12.729> use

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
again on second phase but you can use

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.430 
again on second phase but you can use
questions<00:06:13.150> on<00:06:13.240> first<00:06:13.449> phase<00:06:13.660> you've<00:06:14.229> got<00:06:14.349> to

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
questions on first phase you've got to

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.670 
questions on first phase you've got to
be<00:06:14.500> careful<00:06:14.860> that<00:06:15.039> you're<00:06:15.400> not<00:06:16.080> moving<00:06:17.080> at<00:06:17.530> the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
be careful that you're not moving at the

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.870 
be careful that you're not moving at the
same<00:06:17.860> time<00:06:18.099> you're<00:06:18.250> asking<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.580> questions

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
same time you're asking the questions

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.760 
same time you're asking the questions
because<00:06:19.120> you'll<00:06:19.210> be<00:06:19.330> losing<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.169> control<00:06:20.349> so

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
because you'll be losing the control so

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.170 
because you'll be losing the control so
do<00:06:20.919> that<00:06:21.099> portal<00:06:21.460> at<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.610> side<00:06:21.820> of<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.000> road

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
do that portal at the side of the road

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.180 
do that portal at the side of the road
but<00:06:22.900> on<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.080> second<00:06:23.650> phase<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:23.800> can<00:06:24.010> ask

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
but on a second phase you can ask

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.700 
but on a second phase you can ask
questions<00:06:24.250> on<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.789> move<00:06:24.970> and<00:06:25.500> usually<00:06:26.500> the

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
questions on the move and usually the

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.339 
questions on the move and usually the
pupil<00:06:27.039> should<00:06:27.220> know<00:06:27.900> what<00:06:28.900> they<00:06:28.990> should<00:06:29.020> do

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
pupil should know what they should do

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:30.610 
pupil should know what they should do
and<00:06:29.590> they<00:06:29.650> should<00:06:29.889> know<00:06:30.039> the<00:06:30.190> reasons

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
and they should know the reasons

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.200 
and they should know the reasons
behind<00:06:30.830> why<00:06:30.979> they<00:06:31.100> should<00:06:31.250> do<00:06:31.400> it<00:06:31.520> so<00:06:32.090> by

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
behind why they should do it so by

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.060 
behind why they should do it so by
asking<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:32.600> questions<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.380> you're<00:06:33.979> gonna

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
asking the questions and you're gonna

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.250 
asking the questions and you're gonna
find<00:06:34.340> out<00:06:34.520> and<00:06:34.760> also<00:06:34.910> be<00:06:35.630> able<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.900> correct<00:06:36.169> the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
find out and also be able to correct the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.770 
find out and also be able to correct the
fault<00:06:36.500> by<00:06:37.090> asking<00:06:38.090> questions<00:06:38.449> about<00:06:38.540> what

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
fault by asking questions about what

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.290 
fault by asking questions about what
they're<00:06:38.870> going<00:06:38.960> to<00:06:39.020> do<00:06:39.199> this<00:06:39.380> time<00:06:40.300> in

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
they're going to do this time in

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.260 
they're going to do this time in
comparison<00:06:41.479> to<00:06:41.870> what<00:06:42.020> they<00:06:42.139> did<00:06:42.290> last<00:06:42.470> time<00:06:42.680> so

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
comparison to what they did last time so

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.340 
comparison to what they did last time so
questions<00:06:44.270> are<00:06:44.389> quite<00:06:44.540> important<00:06:45.050> to<00:06:45.080> follow

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
questions are quite important to follow

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.280 
questions are quite important to follow
to<00:06:45.560> correct<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:45.830> false<00:06:46.040> as<00:06:46.220> well<00:06:46.370> and<00:06:47.300> here

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
to correct the false as well and here

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.439 
to correct the false as well and here
we're<00:06:48.410> them<00:06:48.530> off<00:06:48.620> to<00:06:48.710> again<00:06:48.919> 20<00:06:49.580> letters<00:06:49.729> ten

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
we're them off to again 20 letters ten

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.439 
we're them off to again 20 letters ten
words<00:06:50.660> one<00:06:51.440> meaning<00:06:51.800> if<00:06:52.280> it<00:06:52.430> is<00:06:52.550> to<00:06:52.729> be<00:06:52.850> it<00:06:53.270> is

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
words one meaning if it is to be it is

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.930 
words one meaning if it is to be it is
up<00:06:53.570> to<00:06:53.600> me<00:06:53.780> so<00:06:54.740> practice<00:06:55.430> and<00:06:55.850> prepare<00:06:56.090> to<00:06:56.540> pass
