00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello dear and two we left 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.500
 have a not old game here 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 but also not completely new game link and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 Let's just show what you do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
 can or must be there 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.620
 a short guide in english 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 and you can read that once 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.369
 otherwise he is now what I am 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 here we do this and we play this here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 Young girl showing a flashlight 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 here in this dark forest on the way 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.050
 is and on the way there is here 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.150
 various objects animals fall 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 and so we do not go in there thus 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 you can finish the game with one click 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.660
 on display our flashlight quasi 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.129
 Disable and then have the quasi 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 black screens can then over 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.590
 just run these objects away and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.420
 You can also do a few 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 to complete challenges 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 when you get to the example of combo 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.020
 now I believe her very close 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.180
 now this is still stupid 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 ball rolled and we have only the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.719
 possibility of our bags limited 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 use and get here now for 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.079
 for example, an overview how many 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.789
 points we have reached here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 the distance here is unfortunately yards 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.000
 maybe you can say that in 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000
 kilometers to calculate if you want 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 but you do not have to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 we just play again and like you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.290
 Do you see the white bar below when I am down 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.060
 on this presses he reduced himself 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 and many have been playing since I did 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.729
 to get far 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 the problem is of course that you have the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 bags can use the concept of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.689
 and you just have to estimate how 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 the way is still gone without you then 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.970
 yes this trap occurs you see you on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.229
 holes in the floor straight is a ball 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.540
 come to meet 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.200
 There is also something from above 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 down field look what we find there 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 top of the stone is now one 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.649
 a little bit bigger and now it's me 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.360
 faster in a row 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.760
 and that's why you have to feel 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.230
 for what you get here 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.950
 is exactly the flashlight on and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.940
 turns off that works fine now 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.860
 we'll see how far we can get 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.630
 the objects and objects that the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.610
 of course, come faster now 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.800
 in a row and so it is 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.960
 more difficult to have sense here now 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.070
 we do the trap caught and are there 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.530
 really always be entered 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.640
 difficult 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.090
 There is a list here once 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.070
 what you all yes yes what are they 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 There are and which fall in which 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.540
 case has occurred and which not 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.590
 besides, the Christians are still here 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.770
 challenges or 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.120
 Successes as you can see we have two of 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.620
 three managed and now have one here 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.350
 multiplier of 10 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 if you get all met then 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.040
 you keep better multiplier 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 but also gets a better one 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 Best pay or clubs around 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 79 is something else is natural 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.330
 Here again an endless takeover 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.570
 It's a bit different 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.360
 than usual than usual knows 170 you can 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.709
 Definitely dare to leave here 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.709
 And that makes fun in any case
