00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.730
 every race look at being opening one of 

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.880
 my 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.190
 favorite treats so I was 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.990
 eating some bars to the neighbor of 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.480
 celeste this thing is a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.600
 ticket to scratch a gift that according to 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.140
 They give you sabritas and burger king 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.740
 but to win the prize you have to 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.329
 scratch one of the three one of the four 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.940
 of four this 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.859
 this part is that they put you to scratch and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.350
 depending on the one who was the one 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.620
 scratch that is what you earn but then 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.339
 we are seeing that for example scratching the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.719
 scholarship scholarship 3 and scholarship 4 then not in 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.119
 you 're really earning us nothing because 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.290
 you really have to pay you have to 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.990
 pay one of the translations 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.760
 the offer that would serve would be the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.710
 scholarship 1 that actually if you are 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 giving away a regular combo the whopper 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.540
 juniors with cheese 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.090
 good as we are going to do to know 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.189
 which one I'm scratching if we've given ourselves 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.170
 the task of investigating a bit and then the 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.930
 correct way to know what it is that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 you're winning is to use 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.109
 this is a led flash from another cell 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 what we are going to do is put the flash 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.299
 led 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.039
 and put the label flipped with what 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.880
 white down 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.880
 for this it is necessary to use 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 a place where there is not much light where 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 there is not much light that is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.060
 dark preference completely and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.020
 then you put the label with the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.439
 white towards you 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.929
 then put it on top of the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.909
 led light 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.509
 and that will help you see what the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.810
 the options you have to choose a 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.810
 of them 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 Now let's see what we are going to change 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.140
 the video to put it in dark mode 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.090
 because the phone ldl was turned on 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.040
 I'm taking video is that we're going to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.489
 do it again right now we'll see you in the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.489
 next video 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.370
 good very good now we already paid for it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 gives you the phone now let's try 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.800
 see if by pure chance you see 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.800
 the gift that to show us winning 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.090
 I said a while ago that it was the other way around but in 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.250
 reality is this way 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.290
 yes 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.290
 if they manage to see if you can see 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.520
 here it is not going to achieve to see good we are going to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.390
 try to do it in the dark 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.390
 here is a little view 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.390
 offer 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.709
 beckham 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.940
 [Music] 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.640
 decade of america 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:20.280
 scholarship 4 and the first one is scholarships 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.819
 the second is scholarship offer 4 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.430
 the third scholarship offer 3 and the last one is 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:33.219
 scholarship offer 3 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 if it is offer 2 4 3 and 3 we are going to 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.590
 start it to see if it's really 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.920
 true 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.610
 I will be impossible for me Latin 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.739
 without anything else I'm trying to hit if 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.330
 they are going to realize really if yes 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.560
 you can see even with the phone 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
 that I am taking the video is not reached 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.830
 to see if you are going to catch up to see 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.340
 if they use it the way I told them 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.830
 this would be scholarship scholarship 4 scholarship 3 and scholarship 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.460
 3 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.460
 a coin 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.200
 this key 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.770
 let's say this was a scholarship 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.770
 two 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.150
 and indeed if you are watching 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.150
 is 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.609
 scholarship this we said that it was a scholarship 4 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.190
 it's a 24 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.590
 yes 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.770
 We said it was a scholarship in March as 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.770
 the last 23 scholarship 3 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.500
 so 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:45.599
 if you if you touch them or have 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.979
 the intention to be able to win the prize what 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.979
 that all they have to do is 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.080
 use your led 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.569
 and put the in 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.770
 and that's the led and led flash is going to 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.419
 help to know what the prize nothing 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.659
 more would be a matter of looking for 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.659
 obviously 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:14.560
 the bec to one and flush that in that so that 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.020
 are done in the regular combo and that would be 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.340
 totally free 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.630
 Well, they liked the video because it did not 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.870
 like and if you liked it 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.390
 if not only so they can win 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.090
 with the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.690
 with this filth that they put us you would know us 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.240
