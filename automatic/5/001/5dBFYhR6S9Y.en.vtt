that's<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> cool<00:01:06.780> part<00:01:07.020> though<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> cool

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's not the cool part though the cool

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
that's not the cool part though the cool
part<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.190> two<00:01:08.430> gyros<00:01:09.030> mounted

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
part is there's two gyros mounted

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
part is there's two gyros mounted
beneath<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> passenger<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.800> driver<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
beneath the passenger and driver and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
beneath the passenger and driver and
that<00:01:11.850> allows<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.750> c1<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.680> stay<00:01:13.860> upright<00:01:14.220> no

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that allows the c1 to stay upright no

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
that allows the c1 to stay upright no
matter<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> condition<00:01:15.510> is<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
matter what the condition is so you can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.930 
matter what the condition is so you can
literally<00:01:16.530> push<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> weight<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
literally push on it with a weight of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.610 
literally push on it with a weight of
about<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.150> baby<00:01:18.420> elephant<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> it'll<00:01:19.409> stay

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
about a baby elephant and it'll stay

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.550 
about a baby elephant and it'll stay
bolt<00:01:19.920> upright<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.930> through<00:01:22.229> corners

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bolt upright you can go through corners

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
bolt upright you can go through corners
relatively<00:01:23.010> quickly<00:01:23.370> and<00:01:23.640> there's<00:01:24.060> no<00:01:24.180> worry

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
relatively quickly and there's no worry

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
relatively quickly and there's no worry
about<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:25.040> capsizing<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.159> toppling<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:26.670> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
about it capsizing or toppling over if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
about it capsizing or toppling over if
another<00:01:27.240> vehicle<00:01:27.510> hits<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.770> stay

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
another vehicle hits it it can stay

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
another vehicle hits it it can stay
upright<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.400> entire<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
upright the entire time so this is the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
upright the entire time so this is the
first<00:01:34.469> prototype<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> c1<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.939> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
first prototype of the c1 it's kind of a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
first prototype of the c1 it's kind of a
rolling<00:01:36.630> proof<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.289> concept<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> lab<00:01:38.250> for
