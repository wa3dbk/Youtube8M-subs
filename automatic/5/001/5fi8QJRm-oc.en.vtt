of<00:01:34.759> cook<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.330> about<00:01:35.439> anywhere<00:01:36.439> from<00:01:36.530> like

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
of cook it for about anywhere from like

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.620 
of cook it for about anywhere from like
20<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.130> 30<00:01:37.340> minutes<00:01:37.580> depending<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.240> how<00:01:38.360> thick

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
20 to 30 minutes depending on how thick

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.389 
20 to 30 minutes depending on how thick
you<00:01:38.750> want<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.990> yogurt<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.860> longer<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.189> cook

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
you want the yogurt the longer you cook

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.850 
you want the yogurt the longer you cook
it<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.580> thicker<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.030> it'll<00:01:41.720> be<00:01:41.750> because<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
it the thicker it it'll be because the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.340 
it the thicker it it'll be because the
more<00:01:43.159> water<00:01:43.280> dissipates<00:01:43.819> out<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.350> I'm

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
more water dissipates out of it I'm

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.840 
more water dissipates out of it I'm
gonna<00:01:45.470> do<00:01:45.619> mine<00:01:45.740> about<00:01:45.950> 30<00:01:46.340> minutes<00:01:46.700> because

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
gonna do mine about 30 minutes because

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.820 
gonna do mine about 30 minutes because
we<00:01:47.000> like<00:01:47.149> figure<00:01:47.450> yogurt<00:01:47.780> here<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.200> think<00:01:48.770> I

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
we like figure yogurt here I think I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.289 
we like figure yogurt here I think I
might<00:01:48.979> actually<00:01:49.130> divide<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:49.880> into<00:01:49.940> two

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
might actually divide this into two

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.490 
might actually divide this into two
batches<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:50.780> we're<00:01:50.899> done<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.200> do<00:01:51.289> like<00:01:51.470> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
batches when we're done and do like a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.490 
batches when we're done and do like a
Greek<00:01:51.770> yogurt<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.310> once<00:01:52.490> more<00:01:52.729> regular<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.500> so

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
Greek yogurt and once more regular so so

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.050 
Greek yogurt and once more regular so so
we'll<00:01:54.590> let<00:01:54.709> this<00:01:54.830> go<00:01:55.429> on<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.610> as<00:01:55.789> soon<00:01:55.819> as<00:01:55.970> it

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we'll let this go on there as soon as it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.719 
we'll let this go on there as soon as it
gets<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.539> galata<00:01:57.530> point<00:01:57.890> let<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.610> cook

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
gets to the galata point let it cook

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.059 
gets to the galata point let it cook
about<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> half<00:01:59.209> an<00:01:59.330> hour<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.039> you

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
about a half an hour and just so you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.190 
about a half an hour and just so you
know<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.630> looks<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:02.869> at<00:02:03.020> about

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
know this is what it looks like at about

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.440 
know this is what it looks like at about
185<00:02:03.799> degrees<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:04.759> really<00:02:04.970> frothy

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
185 degrees it's really really frothy

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.650 
185 degrees it's really really frothy
and<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:07.190> started<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.729> get<00:02:07.850> sort<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.269> frothy

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and and it started to get sort of frothy

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.809 
and and it started to get sort of frothy
on<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.869> outsides<00:02:09.289> around<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:09.890> 150<00:02:10.640> five

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
on the outsides around like 150 five

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.880 
on the outsides around like 150 five
hundred<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.269> sixty<00:02:11.569> degrees<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.680> it's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
hundred and sixty degrees but it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.069 
hundred and sixty degrees but it's
really<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:13.670> frothy<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.570> what

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
really really frothy now so that's what

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.080 
really really frothy now so that's what
it's<00:02:15.230> at<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.370> think<00:02:16.549> we're<00:02:16.760> probably<00:02:16.850> going

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it's at so I think we're probably going

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.590 
it's at so I think we're probably going
to<00:02:17.150> go<00:02:17.269> about<00:02:17.420> 20<00:02:17.780> minutes<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.600> my

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
to go about 20 minutes like this my

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.410 
to go about 20 minutes like this my
timer<00:02:20.840> went<00:02:21.170> off<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:21.920> I've<00:02:22.100> got<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.609> milk

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
timer went off and now I've got the milk

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.229 
timer went off and now I've got the milk
here<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.380> ice<00:02:24.560> bath<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.160> our<00:02:25.250> sink<00:02:25.579> and

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
here and the ice bath and our sink and

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.340 
here and the ice bath and our sink and
I'm<00:02:26.329> going<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.540> go<00:02:26.660> ahead<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.959> just<00:02:27.079> sort<00:02:27.230> of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
I'm going to go ahead and just sort of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.740 
I'm going to go ahead and just sort of
stir<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.280> try<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.459> cool<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.820> down<00:02:28.850> we

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
stir this and try to cool it down we

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.270 
stir this and try to cool it down we
want<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.049> be<00:02:30.230> colder<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.799> we<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.010> put<00:02:31.160> in

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
want it to be colder so we can put in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.530 
want it to be colder so we can put in
the<00:02:31.400> yogurt<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.820> somewhere<00:02:32.329> between

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the yogurt and somewhere between

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.170 
the yogurt and somewhere between
probably<00:02:33.200> about<00:02:33.290> 100<00:02:33.709> degrees<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.400> where<00:02:34.940> we

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
probably about 100 degrees is where we

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.670 
probably about 100 degrees is where we
want<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.019> then<00:02:36.320> we'll<00:02:36.470> go<00:02:36.590> ahead

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
want to be at and then we'll go ahead

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.000 
want to be at and then we'll go ahead
and<00:02:36.859> put<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> yogurt<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.680> during<00:02:39.920> this

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and put the yogurt in so during this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.830 
and put the yogurt in so during this
whole<00:02:40.220> time<00:02:40.370> I've<00:02:40.609> had<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.760> crock<00:02:41.090> pot<00:02:41.329> on<00:02:41.540> just

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
whole time I've had a crock pot on just

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.229 
whole time I've had a crock pot on just
set<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.049> warm<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:43.400> added<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.820> milk<00:02:44.030> now

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
set it warm and I added the milk now

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.360 
set it warm and I added the milk now
that<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.540> all<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.810> these<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.560> ice<00:02:45.739> bath<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
that it's all of these the ice bath and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.699 
that it's all of these the ice bath and
i<00:02:46.940> added<00:02:47.150> also<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.690> yogurt<00:02:47.989> i<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.590> went

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
i added also the yogurt i just went

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.170 
i added also the yogurt i just went
ahead<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:48.950> added<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.430> whole<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:50.120> whole

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
ahead and added this whole this whole

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.890 
ahead and added this whole this whole
cup<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.230> i<00:02:52.100> think<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.090> because<00:02:53.480> i<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.720> more

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
cup and i think that because i have more

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.059 
cup and i think that because i have more
than<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.140> half<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> gallon<00:02:54.769> that'll<00:02:54.980> be

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
than a half of the gallon that'll be

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.830 
than a half of the gallon that'll be
better<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.819> only<00:02:55.940> need<00:02:56.120> really<00:02:56.450> about<00:02:56.569> three

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
better you only need really about three

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.830 
better you only need really about three
tablespoons<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.799> yogurt<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.720> do<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
tablespoons of the yogurt to do the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.050 
tablespoons of the yogurt to do the
whole<00:02:59.959> half<00:03:00.200> gallon<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.980> you've<00:03:01.880> got<00:03:01.910> that

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
whole half gallon so you've got that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.780 
whole half gallon so you've got that
going<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.690> pretty<00:03:02.930> well<00:03:03.109> mixed<00:03:03.319> up<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.829> i'm

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
going it's pretty well mixed up and i'm

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.780 
going it's pretty well mixed up and i'm
going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.269> ahead<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:05.510> cover<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.100> it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
going to go ahead and cover this and it

do is take about half of this and I'm

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.910 
do is take about half of this and I'm
putting<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.390> strainer<00:03:48.260> over<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.650> bowl

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920

with<00:03:49.790> some<00:03:49.880> coffee<00:03:50.090> filters<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.780> can

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
with some coffee filters in it you can

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.420 
with some coffee filters in it you can
also<00:03:51.020> use<00:03:51.290> cheesecloth<00:03:51.620> if<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.100> have<00:03:52.280> that

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.400 
also use cheesecloth if you have that
but<00:03:52.640> we<00:03:52.760> run<00:03:52.910> out<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:54.080> going<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.260> go<00:03:54.380> ahead

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
but we run out so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.590 
but we run out so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:54.530> put<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:55.700> here<00:03:56.000> I'm<00:03:56.209> going<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.420> let<00:03:56.570> it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
and put that in here I'm going to let it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600 
and put that in here I'm going to let it
just<00:03:56.810> kind<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.050> drip<00:03:57.380> out<00:03:57.590> until<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.400> gets<00:03:58.520> to

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
just kind of drip out until it gets to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.460 
just kind of drip out until it gets to
the<00:03:58.730> right<00:03:58.820> consistency<00:03:59.110> can<00:04:00.110> take<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> few

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
the right consistency can take a few

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.110 
the right consistency can take a few
hours<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:01.160> once<00:04:01.310> that's<00:04:01.459> done<00:04:01.700> I'm

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
hours and then once that's done I'm

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.730 
hours and then once that's done I'm
going<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.600> mix<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.020> with<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.350> little<00:04:03.410> bit<00:04:03.650> of

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
going to mix it with a little bit of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.800 
going to mix it with a little bit of
honey<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.400> i<00:04:04.820> think<00:04:05.180> i'm<00:04:05.300> going<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.450> do<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> few

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
honey and i think i'm going to do a few

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.990 
honey and i think i'm going to do a few
of<00:04:05.900> them<00:04:05.990> maybe<00:04:06.140> like<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.380> peach<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:07.010> blackberry

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
of them maybe like a peach a blackberry

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.060 
of them maybe like a peach a blackberry
and<00:04:08.480> we'll<00:04:09.230> see<00:04:09.440> what<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.709> with<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
and we'll see what I do with the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.290 
and we'll see what I do with the
flavoring<00:04:10.400> maybe<00:04:10.580> something<00:04:10.850> with<00:04:10.940> cinnamon

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
flavoring maybe something with cinnamon

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.170 
flavoring maybe something with cinnamon
and<00:04:11.390> then<00:04:12.080> put<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.350> into<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.560> containers<00:04:13.180> old

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
and then put it into the containers old

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180 
and then put it into the containers old
yogurt<00:04:14.510> containers<00:04:14.959> work<00:04:15.350> really<00:04:15.530> great<00:04:15.860> or

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
yogurt containers work really great or

you can use some glass i think i'm going
to<00:04:17.690> do<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> little<00:04:17.930> mixture<00:04:18.230> of<00:04:18.380> both<00:04:18.530> but<00:04:19.489> that

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
to do a little mixture of both but that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.560 
to do a little mixture of both but that
is<00:04:20.239> how<00:04:20.390> you<00:04:20.450> make<00:04:20.720> our<00:04:20.930> homemade<00:04:21.230> yogurt
