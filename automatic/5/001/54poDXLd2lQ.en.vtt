00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.040
 versatility is a feature that many seek to find in a vehicle 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.560
 and making the car cross rivers and dams is a very strange task but 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.530
 completely possible for some models is what the reporter paula nem 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 to show us this week 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.220
 people look curious 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.289
 but it seems from another planet but what will be this affection so different 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.350
 this was your car that looks more like a boat mix with an example 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.789
 was built in 1944 in Germany at the request of Washington to combat 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.989
 World War II it has a number of functions as the car of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.339
 recognition of fighting cars 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.339
 the car browser 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 the result is an evolution of the fusca that was created by Ferdinand Porsche and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.720
 to provide the German troops 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.090
 there are still many American tip but can develop a number of other 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.010
 functions 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.070
 were in a car was prepared to see right 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.450
 when I'm counting 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.600
 a lighthouse his name only has lighting on the floor 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 he did not give a plane he can not detect it is she on the front he has 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.840
 even two tanks to avoid a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.970
 g1 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.120
 had not even gone 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.880
 who stuck a tank he got in the second tank and the third quiet out 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620
 he is retractable 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.590
 to have a greater 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.850
 visibility it has oar which I have used several times it has the support 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850
 machine gun in front and back 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.230
 manual windshield wipers 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.490
 back also he has power support and machine gun 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090
 they have an elixir behind them 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.660
 retractable 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.550
 It's darn good for you to move around inside the store until 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.210
 lantern you saw is a little lantern to look bigger 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.870
 with which the person is reading an apa and has no light director the enemy who 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 they are up there and andrÃ© you are not there is also something even camouflaged 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.909
 this year ago has a flashlight that is a very interesting thing 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.479
 when they made a train travel of 40 50 cases 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.650
 There's a little light there that's a very interesting thing for them to keep. 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.539
 distance between one car of the other 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.650
 at the end of the war most of these combat vehicles 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.169
 he was beaten 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.810
 but thanks to its versatility 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.040
 the way was still widely used by the police 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.760
 who is the fire department and even by farmers 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.639
 nowadays it is estimated that only 125 southern specimens 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.779
 can be found all over the world 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.869
 here in Brazil there are only three units 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.919
 but only herceptin is in perfect condition 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.290
 thanks to your property 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.509

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.199
 Marketplace 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.699
 world 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.719
 I think it's worth 400,000 a year 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.659
 amphibian october that at 77 was created to guide the fight against enemies today 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.949
