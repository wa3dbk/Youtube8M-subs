suspension McPherson struts in the front
Multi<00:03:37.989> leek<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.320> rear<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.980> does<00:03:39.100> have

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
Multi leek in the rear and it does have

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.740 
Multi leek in the rear and it does have
a<00:03:39.340> limited<00:03:39.670> slip<00:03:39.820> differential<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.600> back

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
a limited slip differential in the back

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.120 
a limited slip differential in the back
so<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:40.989> can't<00:03:41.260> put<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> power<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
so you can't put all the power on the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.800 
so you can't put all the power on the
ground<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.820> nice<00:03:43.030> thing<00:03:43.209> about<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.570> way<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
ground the nice thing about the way the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.060 
ground the nice thing about the way the
Suzuki<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.350> put<00:03:44.530> together<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
Suzuki is put together and the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.740 
Suzuki is put together and the
performance<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:45.820> vehicle<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
performance of this vehicle is the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.900 
performance of this vehicle is the
chassis<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.350> feels<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:47.830> solid<00:03:48.250> though<00:03:48.760> it's

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
chassis it feels very solid though it's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.310 
chassis it feels very solid though it's
a<00:03:49.000> sheer<00:03:49.239> platform<00:03:49.810> with<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.989> couple<00:03:50.290> other

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
a sheer platform with a couple other

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.660 
a sheer platform with a couple other
vehicles<00:03:50.800> they've<00:03:50.920> done<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.070> good<00:03:51.340> job<00:03:51.400> of

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
vehicles they've done a good job of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.030 
vehicles they've done a good job of
making<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.270> feel<00:03:52.900> as<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.530> connected<00:03:53.950> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
making it feel as if it's connected to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.229 
making it feel as if it's connected to
the<00:03:54.160> road<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.520> think<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.850> has<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> lot<00:03:55.209> to

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the road and I think that has a lot to

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.360 
the road and I think that has a lot to
do<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.510> just<00:03:55.870> good<00:03:56.500> engineering<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.190> good

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
do with just good engineering and good

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.620 
do with just good engineering and good
thought<00:03:57.670> through<00:03:57.940> when<00:03:58.150> you're<00:03:58.270> talking

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
thought through when you're talking

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.050 
thought through when you're talking
about<00:03:58.720> giving<00:03:59.410> someone<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.040> multi-use<00:04:00.610> vehicle

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
about giving someone a multi-use vehicle

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.539 
about giving someone a multi-use vehicle
you<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.140> look<00:04:02.290> at<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.650> from<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.160> aspect

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
you have to look at it from the aspect

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.250 
you have to look at it from the aspect
of<00:04:03.730> how<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.000> drives<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.420> street<00:04:04.780> how<00:04:05.140> it

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
of how it drives on the street how it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.750 
of how it drives on the street how it
drives<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.680> freeway<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.280> how<00:04:06.580> it'll

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
drives on the freeway and how it'll

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.280 
drives on the freeway and how it'll
handle<00:04:07.090> off<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.390> road<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.810> think<00:04:08.019> it<00:04:08.110> does

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
handle off the road and I think it does

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.050 
handle off the road and I think it does
all<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.530> those<00:04:08.860> well<00:04:09.100> yeah<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.580> think<00:04:09.790> it's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
all of those well yeah I think it's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.670 
all of those well yeah I think it's
drivability<00:04:10.690> is<00:04:10.870> definitely<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.350> strength

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
drivability is definitely a strength

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.830 
drivability is definitely a strength
that<00:04:11.890> when<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.580> take<00:04:12.730> five<00:04:13.120> passengers<00:04:13.720> or

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
that when you take five passengers or

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.210 
that when you take five passengers or
the<00:04:13.900> average<00:04:14.230> family<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.769> drive<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.130> around

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
the average family and drive it around

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.590 
the average family and drive it around
it's<00:04:15.459> fine<00:04:15.640> it's<00:04:15.850> when<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.120> load<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.390> with<00:04:16.479> the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
it's fine it's when you load it with the

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.940 
it's fine it's when you load it with the
seven<00:04:16.900> pastors<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.590> needs<00:04:17.769> more

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
seven pastors that it needs more

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.680 
seven pastors that it needs more
horsepower<00:04:18.340> you're<00:04:18.459> being<00:04:18.669> too<00:04:18.820> picky<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.299> am

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
horsepower you're being too picky I am

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.000 
horsepower you're being too picky I am
let's<00:04:19.840> do<00:04:19.989> three<00:04:20.140> points<00:04:20.470> two<00:04:20.560> five<00:04:20.799> for

suggestion like we did in the last
segment<00:04:31.479> fit<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.169> finish<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.500> also<00:04:32.710> up<00:04:33.070> for

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
segment fit and finish is also up for

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.040 
segment fit and finish is also up for
suzuki<00:04:33.760> as<00:04:33.850> well<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> i<00:04:34.510> think<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.780> made<00:04:34.930> good

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
suzuki as well and i think you made good

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.320 
suzuki as well and i think you made good
points<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.560> mean<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.919> believe<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.180> way

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
points I mean I believe that the way

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.790 
points I mean I believe that the way
that<00:04:37.479> this<00:04:37.600> vehicle<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.020> put<00:04:38.140> together<00:04:38.290> can

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
that this vehicle is put together can

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.650 
that this vehicle is put together can
really<00:04:39.100> show<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.460> future<00:04:39.790> for<00:04:39.970> suzuki<00:04:40.390> as<00:04:40.510> an

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
really show the future for suzuki as an

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.480 
really show the future for suzuki as an
auto<00:04:40.840> manufacturer<00:04:41.380> they've<00:04:42.040> already<00:04:42.220> come

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
auto manufacturer they've already come

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.310 
auto manufacturer they've already come
in<00:04:42.640> with<00:04:42.760> some<00:04:42.940> really<00:04:43.210> inexpensive<00:04:43.479> baseline

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
in with some really inexpensive baseline

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.140 
in with some really inexpensive baseline
vehicles<00:04:44.800> now<00:04:45.190> they're<00:04:45.340> starting<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.729> move<00:04:45.910> up

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
vehicles now they're starting to move up

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.820 
vehicles now they're starting to move up
scale<00:04:46.419> when<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.840> move<00:04:47.080> up<00:04:47.290> scale<00:04:47.590> with<00:04:47.770> a

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
scale when you move up scale with a

scale when you move up scale with a
vehicle<00:04:48.220> lineup<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.760> have<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.180> be<00:04:49.300> able<00:04:49.510> to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
vehicle lineup you have to be able to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.760 
vehicle lineup you have to be able to
make<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.930> that<00:04:50.140> much<00:04:50.380> better

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
make it that much better

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100 
make it that much better
people<00:04:51.250> expect<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.090> it's<00:04:52.450> under<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.780> little

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
people expect it and it's under a little

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.080 
people expect it and it's under a little
bit<00:04:53.229> more<00:04:53.440> scrutiny<00:04:53.919> than<00:04:53.950> say<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.460> mercedes

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
bit more scrutiny than say a mercedes

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.700 
bit more scrutiny than say a mercedes
banz<00:04:55.330> where<00:04:55.660> they<00:04:55.780> just<00:04:55.930> kind<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.200> assume<00:04:56.530> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
banz where they just kind of assume the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.170 
banz where they just kind of assume the
quality<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.160> there<00:04:57.340> they've<00:04:57.760> done<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:57.970> great

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
quality is there they've done a great
