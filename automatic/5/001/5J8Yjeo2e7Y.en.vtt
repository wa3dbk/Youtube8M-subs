gentlemen<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.639> another<00:00:02.850> video<00:00:03.030> why<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.449> this

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
gentlemen to another video why is this

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.639 
gentlemen to another video why is this
video<00:00:04.140> called<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.830> Sun<00:00:05.190> fall<00:00:05.490> theory

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
video called the Sun fall theory

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.799 
video called the Sun fall theory
interesting<00:00:07.649> isn't<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:08.040> yes<00:00:08.610> after<00:00:09.480> releasing

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
interesting isn't it yes after releasing

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.270 
interesting isn't it yes after releasing
the<00:00:10.340> 100<00:00:11.340> level<00:00:11.880> 100<00:00:12.509> druid<00:00:12.929> talents<00:00:13.650> video<00:00:13.980> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the 100 level 100 druid talents video I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.849 
the 100 level 100 druid talents video I
give<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> more<00:00:15.480> thought<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.770> actually

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
give it more thought and I actually

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.769 
give it more thought and I actually
looked<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> new<00:00:17.730> dream<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> scenarios<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
looked at the new dream of scenarios and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.010 
looked at the new dream of scenarios and
I<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> thinking<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:21.020> could

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I was kind of thinking about how could

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740 
I was kind of thinking about how could
these<00:00:22.199> towns<00:00:22.529> possibly<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.519> viable<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.660> know

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
these towns possibly be viable you know

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970 
these towns possibly be viable you know
compared<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> equinox<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.980> found

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
compared to equinox I think I found

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.139 
compared to equinox I think I found
something<00:00:29.630> ok<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.990> theory<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> based<00:00:32.430> on

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
something ok so this theory is based on

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.350 
something ok so this theory is based on
a<00:00:33.780> synergy<00:00:34.649> from<00:00:34.980> sold<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> forest<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.210> can

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a synergy from sold the forest you can

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
a synergy from sold the forest you can
see<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> proc<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> screen<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:37.550> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
see a proc on the screen right now the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.970 
see a proc on the screen right now the
new<00:00:38.850> rework<00:00:39.420> dream<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> scenarios<00:00:40.469> Ford<00:00:40.739> run

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
new rework dream of scenarios Ford run

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.470 
new rework dream of scenarios Ford run
or<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> son<00:00:41.879> fall<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:44.239> what<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.390> about

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
or and son fall and what it's about

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
or and son fall and what it's about
basically<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.280> dancing<00:00:47.969> between

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
basically is you dancing between

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.330 
basically is you dancing between
eclipses<00:00:49.020> no<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.800> forth<00:00:50.070> back

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
eclipses no going back and forth back

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.029 
eclipses no going back and forth back
and<00:00:50.370> forth<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.030> forth<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.690> fast

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
and forth back and forth as fast

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
and forth back and forth as fast
possible<00:00:53.039> via<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> usage<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.079> soul<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
possible via the usage of the soul of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
possible via the usage of the soul of
the<00:00:55.469> forest<00:00:55.829> proc<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.180> only<00:00:57.449> problem<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the forest proc the only problem with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
the forest proc the only problem with
this<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> forest

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this right now is that so the forest

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
this right now is that so the forest
only<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.289> eight<00:01:01.530> percent<00:01:02.100> chance<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.969> proc

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
only has an eight percent chance to proc

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960 
only has an eight percent chance to proc
which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> biggest<00:01:04.409> issue<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
which is the biggest issue right now so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
which is the biggest issue right now so
I<00:01:06.510> either<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.159> random<00:01:08.580> prox

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I either got you know some random prox

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.200 
I either got you know some random prox
or<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> series<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:11.130> frequent<00:01:11.880> prox

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
or I got a series of very frequent prox

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
or I got a series of very frequent prox
I<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> has<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> global<00:01:13.530> cooldown

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I don't think it has a global cooldown

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
I don't think it has a global cooldown
or<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:15.420> time<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.930> went<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
or one time I actually went with a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.429 
or one time I actually went with a
minute<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> half<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.479> window<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.140> nope

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
minute and a half just window of nope

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.410 
minute and a half just window of nope
rocks<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.150> eclipse

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rocks I was just going from an eclipse

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.789 
rocks I was just going from an eclipse
to<00:01:21.570> an<00:01:21.659> eclipse<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.259> eclipse<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> an

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to an eclipse to an eclipse to an

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
to an eclipse to an eclipse to an
eclipse<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.580> getting<00:01:23.880> any<00:01:24.000> prog<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
eclipse not getting any prog so it's the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
eclipse not getting any prog so it's the
only<00:01:25.590> issue<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.070> very<00:01:26.400> reliable<00:01:27.049> now

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
only issue it's not very reliable now

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.149 
only issue it's not very reliable now
the<00:01:28.110> new<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> reword<00:01:29.520> dream<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> scenarios

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
the new and reword dream of scenarios

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
the new and reword dream of scenarios
it's<00:01:32.159> actually<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:32.939> cool<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.630> balance

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it's actually pretty cool for balance

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's actually pretty cool for balance
and<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.570> very<00:01:36.869> competitive

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and I think it will be very competitive

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.950 
and I think it will be very competitive
against<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> wild<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> nature's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
you use that healing touch to heal

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.990 
you use that healing touch to heal
either<00:01:52.990> yourself<00:01:53.140> or<00:01:53.650> someone<00:01:53.890> else<00:01:54.040> your

either yourself or someone else your

either yourself or someone else your
next<00:01:55.300> Star<00:01:55.810> Search<00:01:56.110> will<00:01:56.440> not<00:01:56.710> trigger<00:01:57.070> its

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
next Star Search will not trigger its

next Star Search will not trigger its
cool<00:01:57.640> down<00:01:58.170> okay<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.380> can<00:01:59.410> cause<00:01:59.740> 2<00:02:00.040> star

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.010 
surges instead of one and it triggering
the<00:02:03.580> cooldown<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.030> can<00:02:04.210> cast<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the cooldown you can cast to and the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.640 
the cooldown you can cast to and the
second<00:02:05.410> one<00:02:05.530> will<00:02:05.710> trigger<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.040> coulomb<00:02:07.650> the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
second one will trigger the coulomb the

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.130 
second one will trigger the coulomb the
idea<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.070> this<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.840> are<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:14.050> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
idea of this is that you are going to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.200 
idea of this is that you are going to
use<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.440> instant<00:02:14.890> healing<00:02:15.040> touch<00:02:15.430> when<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
use this instant healing touch when you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.620 
use this instant healing touch when you
enter<00:02:16.510> an<00:02:16.660> eclipse<00:02:17.050> okay<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.280> after<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.330> fire

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
enter an eclipse okay or after you fire

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.650 
enter an eclipse okay or after you fire
off<00:02:19.660> an<00:02:20.140> instant<00:02:20.650> star<00:02:20.860> search<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.480> let's<00:02:22.480> just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
off an instant star search so let's just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.230 
off an instant star search so let's just
say<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.870> start<00:02:23.260> off<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.710> solar<00:02:24.160> eclipse<00:02:24.550> okay

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
say you start off in solar eclipse okay

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.630 
say you start off in solar eclipse okay
so<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.540> use<00:02:25.900> your<00:02:25.930> Healing<00:02:26.440> Touch<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:27.160> two

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
so you use your Healing Touch use two

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.570 
so you use your Healing Touch use two
star<00:02:27.910> surges<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.840> fire<00:02:29.140> up<00:02:29.170> some<00:02:29.560> fall<00:02:29.890> you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
star surges you fire up some fall you

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.550 
star surges you fire up some fall you
have<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.880> dots<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.510> start<00:02:31.780> casting<00:02:32.020> wrath

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
have your dots you start casting wrath

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.690 
have your dots you start casting wrath

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and you keep going towards lunar if at

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.300 
and you keep going towards lunar if at
any<00:02:36.970> given<00:02:37.240> time<00:02:37.420> before<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.140> leave<00:02:38.410> lunar<00:02:39.100> or

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
solar sorry you get so the forest proc

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.870 
solar sorry you get so the forest proc
you<00:02:43.660> jump<00:02:44.110> into<00:02:44.320> lunar<00:02:45.040> eclipse<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.640> use

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
you jump into lunar eclipse and use

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.740 
you jump into lunar eclipse and use
starfall<00:02:47.190> maybe<00:02:48.190> even<00:02:48.550> before<00:02:48.850> your<00:02:49.240> son<00:02:49.480> fall

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
starfall maybe even before your son fall

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.620 
starfall maybe even before your son fall
runs<00:02:50.110> off<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:51.640> here<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.510> interesting

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
runs off now here is the interesting

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
runs off now here is the interesting
thing<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.800> use<00:02:54.070> your<00:02:54.310> instant<00:02:54.820> healing

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
thing you will use your instant healing

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.560 
thing you will use your instant healing
touch<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:57.190> will<00:02:57.310> cost<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.820> star<00:02:58.120> surges

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
touch and you will cost to star surges

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.750 
touch and you will cost to star surges
and<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> will<00:02:58.930> keep<00:02:59.170> casting<00:02:59.500> wrath<00:02:59.980> because

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
and you will keep casting wrath because

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.900 
and you will keep casting wrath because
it's<00:03:01.060> much<00:03:01.239> faster<00:03:01.480> much<00:03:01.930> much<00:03:02.830> faster<00:03:03.040> so

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
it's much faster much much faster so

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.210 
it's much faster much much faster so
you're<00:03:04.330> basically<00:03:04.989> by<00:03:05.530> doing<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.160> are

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
you're basically by doing this you are

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.670 
you're basically by doing this you are
trying<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.700> force<00:03:07.150> another<00:03:07.500> soul<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
trying to force another soul of the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.320 
trying to force another soul of the
forest<00:03:09.040> proc

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
forest proc

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.400 
forest proc
now<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.700> will<00:03:12.880> still<00:03:13.240> use<00:03:13.270> star<00:03:13.720> surges<00:03:14.200> and

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
now you will still use star surges and

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.430 
now you will still use star surges and
you're<00:03:14.920> shooting<00:03:15.370> stars<00:03:15.730> prox<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.960> move<00:03:17.200> you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
you're shooting stars prox to move you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580 
you're shooting stars prox to move you
toward<00:03:17.890> zero<00:03:18.190> lunar<00:03:18.880> energy<00:03:19.270> once<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.410> reach

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
toward zero lunar energy once you reach

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.280 
toward zero lunar energy once you reach
zero<00:03:20.950> lunar<00:03:21.400> energy<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.420> will<00:03:22.450> start<00:03:22.900> start

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
zero lunar energy you will start start

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.770 
zero lunar energy you will start start
casting<00:03:23.530> Starfire's<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.880> get<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.210> back<00:03:25.480> into

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
casting Starfire's to get you back into

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.940 
casting Starfire's to get you back into
solar<00:03:26.670> now<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.960> I've<00:03:29.350> been<00:03:29.530> playing

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
solar now you know I've been playing

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.590 
solar now you know I've been playing
around<00:03:30.100> with<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.460> for<00:03:30.730> an<00:03:30.820> hour<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.390> don't

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
around with this for an hour and I don't

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.990 
around with this for an hour and I don't
have<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.870> new<00:03:32.020> spell<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.620> this<00:03:33.520> is<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:33.850> a

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
have the new spell so this is just a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.960 
have the new spell so this is just a
theory<00:03:34.360> but<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.960> might<00:03:35.140> actually<00:03:35.970> do

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
theory but it might actually do

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.620 
theory but it might actually do
something<00:03:37.590> okay<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.090> idea<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.570> is

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
something okay so the idea of this is

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.510 
something okay so the idea of this is
that<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:42.400> want<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.700> cast<00:03:43.000> as<00:03:43.300> many<00:03:43.600> spells<00:03:43.960> as

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
that you want to cast as many spells as

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520 
that you want to cast as many spells as
possible<00:03:45.520> in<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.420> short<00:03:46.870> amount<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.140> time<00:03:47.230> as

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
possible in a short amount of time as

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.530 
possible in a short amount of time as
possible<00:03:47.710> so<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:50.650> forcing<00:03:51.130> more<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
possible so you are forcing more so the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.870 
possible so you are forcing more so the
forest<00:03:52.840> products<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.100> get<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> cascade

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
forest products and if you get a cascade

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.300 
forest products and if you get a cascade
of<00:03:55.180> just<00:03:55.840> solve<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.380> forest<00:03:56.709> Prague<00:03:56.950> after

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
of just solve the forest Prague after

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.520 
of just solve the forest Prague after
Prague<00:03:57.580> after<00:03:57.970> Prague<00:03:58.209> after<00:03:58.570> proc<00:03:58.840> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
Prague after Prague after proc this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.750 
Prague after Prague after proc this
could<00:03:59.830> be<00:04:00.040> insane<00:04:01.560> okay<00:04:02.560> couple<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.310> times<00:04:03.340> I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
could be insane okay couple of times I

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.010 
could be insane okay couple of times I
think<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.600> video<00:04:04.840> as<00:04:04.990> well

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
think it's in this video as well

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.300 
think it's in this video as well
somewhere<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.130> got<00:04:06.820> like<00:04:07.090> five<00:04:07.510> prox<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.980> one

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
somewhere I got like five prox just one

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.190 
somewhere I got like five prox just one
after<00:04:09.580> another<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:10.480> jumping<00:04:10.900> from<00:04:11.050> an

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
after another just jumping from an

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.390 
after another just jumping from an
eclipse<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.680> an<00:04:11.770> eclipse<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.250> when<00:04:12.340> I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
eclipse to an eclipse to when I

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.180 
eclipse to an eclipse to when I
clipstone<00:04:12.850> eclipse<00:04:13.240> if<00:04:13.990> that<00:04:14.350> happens<00:04:14.620> and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
clipstone eclipse if that happens and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.430 
clipstone eclipse if that happens and
you<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.519> sunfall<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.690> have<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.049> new<00:04:17.200> dream

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
you have sunfall you have the new dream

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.720 
you have sunfall you have the new dream
of<00:04:17.560> scenario<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.100> you're<00:04:18.220> going<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.430> do<00:04:18.519> some

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
of scenario so you're going to do some

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.260 
of scenario so you're going to do some
serious<00:04:19.060> damage<00:04:19.269> with<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.919> okay<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.270> think

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
serious damage with that okay I think

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.450 
serious damage with that okay I think
it's<00:04:22.450> here<00:04:22.840> maybe

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
it's here maybe

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.180 
it's here maybe
here<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.180> jump<00:04:25.509> into<00:04:25.690> an<00:04:25.840> eclipse<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.740> start

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
here I jump into an eclipse I start

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.030 
here I jump into an eclipse I start
casting<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.960> here<00:04:29.259> or<00:04:29.289> not

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
casting is it here or not

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.100 
casting is it here or not
I<00:04:31.130> don't<00:04:31.790> think<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.560> no<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:35.210> already<00:04:35.720> happened

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I don't think so no it already happened

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.550 
I don't think so no it already happened
or<00:04:36.820> it's<00:04:37.820> gonna<00:04:38.000> happen<00:04:38.270> doesn't<00:04:38.840> matter<00:04:38.930> so

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
or it's gonna happen doesn't matter so

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.110 
or it's gonna happen doesn't matter so
the<00:04:39.920> idea<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.550> want<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.790> cast<00:04:41.000> as

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
the idea is that you want to cast as

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.810 
the idea is that you want to cast as
many<00:04:41.330> spells<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.350> short<00:04:42.680> period<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:43.370> time<00:04:43.430> as

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
many spells in a short period of time as

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.460 
many spells in a short period of time as
possible<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:47.420> basically<00:04:47.570> go<00:04:47.930> from<00:04:48.170> solar

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
possible so you basically go from solar

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.430 
possible so you basically go from solar
to<00:04:48.800> lunar<00:04:49.160> then<00:04:49.850> lunar<00:04:50.390> you're<00:04:50.660> casting<00:04:51.140> rats

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
to lunar then lunar you're casting rats

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.400 
to lunar then lunar you're casting rats
and<00:04:51.860> you're<00:04:51.980> moving<00:04:52.220> towards<00:04:53.030> solar<00:04:53.450> with

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
and you're moving towards solar with

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.810 
and you're moving towards solar with
star<00:04:54.770> surges<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:57.190> you're<00:04:58.190> basically<00:04:58.550> trying

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
star surges and you're basically trying

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.960 
star surges and you're basically trying
to<00:04:59.000> utilize<00:04:59.270> son<00:05:00.080> fall<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.620> starfall<00:05:01.250> plus

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
to utilize son fall and starfall plus

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.090 
to utilize son fall and starfall plus
your<00:05:02.240> dream<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.630> scenarios<00:05:03.170> healing<00:05:03.650> touches

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
your dream of scenarios healing touches

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.200 
your dream of scenarios healing touches
and<00:05:04.280> additional<00:05:05.060> star<00:05:05.300> surges<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:06.890> just<00:05:07.670> do<00:05:08.030> as

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
and additional star surges to just do as

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.630 
and additional star surges to just do as
much<00:05:08.480> damage<00:05:08.510> as<00:05:08.990> possible<00:05:09.050> that's<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.160> idea

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
much damage as possible that's the idea

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.620 
much damage as possible that's the idea
ok<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.830> cannot<00:05:12.830> test<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.580> which<00:05:14.180> is<00:05:14.360> rather

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
ok I cannot test it which is rather

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.070 
ok I cannot test it which is rather
irritating<00:05:16.090> but<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.150> think<00:05:17.600> this<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.750> gonna<00:05:17.930> be

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
irritating but I think this is gonna be

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.060 
irritating but I think this is gonna be
the<00:05:18.170> first<00:05:18.500> thing<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.040> will<00:05:19.100> do<00:05:19.810> when<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:21.590> get

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
the first thing I will do when I get

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.070 
the first thing I will do when I get
into<00:05:22.490> beta<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.210> actually<00:05:23.360> get<00:05:23.750> up<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:24.050> a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
into beta and I actually get up to a

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.560 
into beta and I actually get up to a
little<00:05:24.290> 100<00:05:24.770> because<00:05:25.580> I'm<00:05:25.700> really<00:05:26.000> curious<00:05:26.330> to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
little 100 because I'm really curious to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.220 
little 100 because I'm really curious to
see<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.770> results<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:28.670> because<00:05:29.330> if<00:05:29.900> the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
see the results of this because if the

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.260 
see the results of this because if the
synergy<00:05:30.740> works<00:05:31.400> as<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:32.660> think<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.710> will<00:05:34.270> this

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
synergy works as I think it will this

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.890 
synergy works as I think it will this
might<00:05:35.600> be<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:37.100> top<00:05:37.430> dps<00:05:37.730> thing<00:05:38.240> ok<00:05:38.570> this<00:05:38.720> might

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
might be the top dps thing ok this might

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.680 
might be the top dps thing ok this might
be<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.230> micromanaging<00:05:40.100> thing<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:41.210> feral

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
be the micromanaging thing that feral

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.570 
be the micromanaging thing that feral
druids<00:05:41.990> are<00:05:42.140> doing<00:05:42.560> with<00:05:42.740> dream<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.100> scenarios

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
druids are doing with dream of scenarios

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.060 
druids are doing with dream of scenarios
ok<00:05:43.850> we<00:05:44.000> can<00:05:44.030> have<00:05:44.330> something<00:05:44.690> similar

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
ok we can have something similar

ok we can have something similar
and<00:05:47.080> it's<00:05:48.080> great<00:05:48.260> because<00:05:48.320> it<00:05:48.770> raises<00:05:49.100> the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
and it's great because it raises the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.250 
and it's great because it raises the
moon<00:05:49.580> concealing<00:05:50.180> even<00:05:50.510> higher<00:05:50.720> nomu

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
moon concealing even higher nomu

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
concealing you know the skill ceiling is

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.780 
concealing you know the skill ceiling is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.390 
also had a minute and a half window
where<00:06:22.670> I<00:06:22.700> got<00:06:23.030> zero<00:06:23.510> blocks<00:06:23.840> precisely<00:06:24.400> so

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
where I got zero blocks precisely so

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.890 
where I got zero blocks precisely so
yeah<00:06:25.490> this<00:06:25.730> will<00:06:25.880> be<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.060> first<00:06:26.240> thing<00:06:26.510> I<00:06:26.720> will

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
yeah this will be the first thing I will

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.870 
yeah this will be the first thing I will
try<00:06:27.200> when<00:06:27.740> I<00:06:27.800> get<00:06:27.920> into<00:06:28.220> beta<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.790> I'm

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
try when I get into beta and I'm

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.640 
try when I get into beta and I'm
actually<00:06:29.000> over<00:06:29.330> 100<00:06:29.510> if<00:06:29.960> this<00:06:30.230> energy

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
actually over 100 if this energy

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.890 
actually over 100 if this energy
actually<00:06:30.890> works<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.790> if<00:06:32.710> somehow<00:06:33.710> I<00:06:34.900> can

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
actually works and if somehow I can

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.740 
actually works and if somehow I can
create<00:06:36.620> a<00:06:36.950> viable<00:06:37.220> way<00:06:37.670> or<00:06:37.970> I<00:06:38.000> can<00:06:38.240> think<00:06:38.510> of<00:06:38.630> a

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
create a viable way or I can think of a

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.130 
create a viable way or I can think of a
viable<00:06:39.230> way<00:06:39.440> to<00:06:39.470> proc<00:06:40.160> so<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.670> forest<00:06:41.150> you

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
viable way to proc so the forest you

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.900 
viable way to proc so the forest you
know<00:06:42.170> kind<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.650> reliably<00:06:43.220> it's<00:06:43.520> always<00:06:43.820> going

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
know kind of reliably it's always going

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.540 
know kind of reliably it's always going
to<00:06:43.970> be<00:06:44.030> unreliable<00:06:44.570> because<00:06:45.230> a<00:06:45.710> percentage

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
to be unreliable because a percentage

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.230 
to be unreliable because a percentage
chance<00:06:46.850> proc<00:06:47.620> but<00:06:48.620> I<00:06:49.070> think<00:06:49.880> this<00:06:49.970> might<00:06:50.210> be

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
chance proc but I think this might be

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.200 
chance proc but I think this might be
actually<00:06:50.510> pretty<00:06:50.870> good<00:06:51.250> so<00:06:52.250> yeah<00:06:52.760> what<00:06:53.090> do<00:06:53.150> you

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
actually pretty good so yeah what do you

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.960 
actually pretty good so yeah what do you
think<00:06:53.480> about<00:06:53.570> this<00:06:53.930> I<00:06:54.230> think<00:06:55.040> this<00:06:55.520> might<00:06:55.760> be<00:06:55.790> a

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
think about this I think this might be a

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.210 
think about this I think this might be a
good<00:06:56.180> thing<00:06:56.320> eventually<00:06:57.320> by<00:06:57.920> the<00:06:57.980> way<00:06:58.100> this

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
good thing eventually by the way this

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.040 
good thing eventually by the way this
this<00:06:58.430> is<00:06:58.580> how<00:06:58.790> I<00:07:00.370> basically<00:07:01.370> learned<00:07:01.850> the<00:07:02.630> tips

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
this is how I basically learned the tips

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.560 
this is how I basically learned the tips
and<00:07:03.200> tricks<00:07:03.530> of<00:07:03.860> you<00:07:04.490> know<00:07:04.610> moon<00:07:05.180> kidding

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.570 
and tricks of you know moon kidding

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.600 
and tricks of you know moon kidding
around<00:07:05.720> I<00:07:06.260> just<00:07:06.950> stand<00:07:07.160> in<00:07:07.250> front<00:07:07.310> of<00:07:07.520> a

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
around I just stand in front of a

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.160 
around I just stand in front of a
training<00:07:07.850> dummy<00:07:08.240> and<00:07:08.390> I<00:07:08.480> just<00:07:08.660> play<00:07:08.990> with

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
training dummy and I just play with

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.280 
training dummy and I just play with
something<00:07:09.650> until<00:07:10.400> it<00:07:10.700> either<00:07:11.030> works<00:07:11.390> in<00:07:12.080> which

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
something until it either works in which

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.230 
something until it either works in which
case<00:07:12.500> i<00:07:12.740> will<00:07:12.800> make<00:07:13.040> a<00:07:13.070> guide<00:07:13.400> or<00:07:13.430> a<00:07:13.700> video<00:07:13.850> for

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
case i will make a guide or a video for

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.810 
case i will make a guide or a video for
you<00:07:14.270> guys<00:07:14.360> or<00:07:14.920> I'm<00:07:15.920> like<00:07:16.130> yep<00:07:16.310> this<00:07:16.610> doesn't

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
you guys or I'm like yep this doesn't

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.580 
you guys or I'm like yep this doesn't
work<00:07:17.090> and<00:07:17.300> I<00:07:17.330> will<00:07:17.450> bury<00:07:17.690> it<00:07:17.840> under<00:07:18.290> the<00:07:18.410> ground

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
work and I will bury it under the ground

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.700 
work and I will bury it under the ground
and<00:07:18.950> now<00:07:19.040> we'll<00:07:19.220> never<00:07:19.340> talk<00:07:19.550> about<00:07:19.730> it<00:07:19.850> again

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
and now we'll never talk about it again

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.160 
and now we'll never talk about it again
so<00:07:21.710> this<00:07:22.010> is<00:07:22.040> just<00:07:22.340> an<00:07:22.520> idea<00:07:22.700> I<00:07:23.300> don't<00:07:23.930> have<00:07:24.020> any

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.170 
so this is just an idea I don't have any

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.160 
so this is just an idea I don't have any
numbers<00:07:24.230> i<00:07:24.920> have<00:07:25.100> nothing<00:07:25.400> I<00:07:25.910> am<00:07:26.360> I<00:07:26.720> just<00:07:27.050> have

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
numbers i have nothing I am I just have

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.820 
numbers i have nothing I am I just have
this<00:07:27.290> theory<00:07:27.590> that<00:07:27.740> it<00:07:28.160> might<00:07:29.000> work

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
this theory that it might work

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.890 
this theory that it might work
eventually<00:07:30.830> oh<00:07:31.120> yeah<00:07:32.120> I<00:07:32.240> almost<00:07:32.270> forgot<00:07:32.480> I

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:32.900 
eventually oh yeah I almost forgot I

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.550 
eventually oh yeah I almost forgot I
want<00:07:33.230> your<00:07:33.380> feedback<00:07:34.120> comment<00:07:35.200> all<00:07:36.200> of<00:07:36.410> them
