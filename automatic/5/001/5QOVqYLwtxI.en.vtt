 beginning of the March edition of 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.050
 our list with the best programs and 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.109
 games for windows that have painted or been 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.730
 updated on the site bajaki continue with 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.949
 Let's go and check out a lot of cool things. 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.329
 Our first tip is that of pa mini esse 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.279
 is an audio player with a visual 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.779
 interesting even he can 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.840
 follow the style that your windows 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.730
 Does the program work with libraries? 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 then you need to indicate the folders 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.280
 where your songs are and then the domain 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.050
 organize content by artist or album 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.969
 this player is still in the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.219
 development, then it can 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.300
 have some flaws and will still have 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.309
 many functions implemented in the future 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.140
 this month's selection continues with avast 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.539
 for business considered the first 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.699
 multi-platform security solution 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.039
 for small and medium companies 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.929
 According to the developer, it is also 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.030
 free and has the same features of 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.220
 individual version of antivirus 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.869
 The difference is that it has a 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 control online that an administrator 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.970
 you can use to perform actions on 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.189
 any computer on a network and that is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.439
 the most interesting feature because everything 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.079
 can be done from anywhere and the 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.909
 any time 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.280
 our video can also help those 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.290
 that deleted a file by accident 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.240
 dial a tool that you can 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.490
 to use to recover data to disks 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.219
 internal or external and also 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 participations an advantage of the 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.630
 vinyl is that it keeps a record of 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 files that have been deleted but it is always 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.369
 good advise for better than a software 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.180
 recovery is not always possible 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.189
 Recover what you need 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.700
 his work in the field of digital security 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.649
 the company used the same open source 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.170
 gave rise to the cone and added 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.780
 unique technologies to give more 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 security for the user similarity 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.840
 with google's browser is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 giant 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.959
 page checker 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.010
 an optimizer that leaves the most 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.280
 insurance 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.310
 It's time to talk about cool games. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.470
 As heroes the magicians this game was made 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.750
 by a chrono trigger fan with the idea 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.640
 to tell the trajectory of magicians or 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.920
 player accompanies the character from 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.170
 when he was a subordinate of ozzy 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.830
 even when he wins fame that he has 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.709
 in the RPG game released in 1995 for the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 super nintendo and more bitter do not have the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.330
 same chrono trigger mechanics of 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.170
 fact the game has different style with 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.019
 elements of rpg platform games of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.540
 glory is another game of the gen mobo them 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.160
 here are more dynamic since 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.140
 a team needs to master locations 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.290
 strategies to reduce barriers to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.200
 of the opposing page and thus 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.690
 time starts with 100% power and goes 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.180
 losing a little of it each time the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.700
 opposing team dominates at least one of 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.340
 three strategic points a team 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.739
 when you destroy the two 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 protection towers and then the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.049
 main opponent 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.120
 sonic extreme is a sega project 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.250
 abandoned many years ago 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.500
 the developer first thought of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.900
 a 2D game for the mega drive 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.420
 but the title was postponed and transferred from 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.590

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 game development files and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.650
 decided to launch it for computers 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.170
 as it is still in production in the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.829
 moment has only one phase 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.130
