00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.840
 news for you guys but I was going to tie 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.330
 your tall and sweet sax 23 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.850
 you state of conservation 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.850
 This instrument is very good, it comes 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.650
 accompanied as elmer six mouthpieces 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.059
 around the world and also one of the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.309
 I'll play just a little bit I 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.040
 I would like you to forgive me that I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.800
 I'm not a sax player I'm a flute player 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.969
 and sometimes I try to venture into 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 saxophone 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.539
 when I have a little time but it's the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.000
 tenor sax with high sax does not have a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 new experience and then this is a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.140
 instrument 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.649
 You see that you can see that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 her that the pain is very good almost 100% 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.010
 only with some risks in this part of the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 instrument 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 some small risks here but nothing that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 disrupts the performance of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.409
 instrument is also very good 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.229
 all the notes are being 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.180
 The only problem is the musician. 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.530
 here come're'm a little 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.530
