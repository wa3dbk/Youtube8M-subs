00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.680
 good 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.189
 Y 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.189
 good 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.120
 there are not good times for many 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.549
 they consider the best player of all 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.350
 Argentine Leo Messi is not a year 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.730
 of the world cup, therefore, all of Barcelona club 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.359
 It is the perfect platform to demonstrate 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.460
 which is back and that 2014-2015 is the 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.870
 year of his reconquest why adidas 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.789
 wants to collaborate with this moment so 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.680
 important for the Argentine player and 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.260
 has created a new one says the f50 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.750
 exclusive for its first 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.910
 matches with FC Barcelona not 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.770
 it's just one more boot with one 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.120
 decoration of exclusive tests but 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.399
 that in the template area we can 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.199
 see the decoration more than a booty where 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.789
 highlights the azulgrana color that is going to 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.839
 dress during the season with the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.839
 Catalan team 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.440
 the rest of the characteristics of the boot 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600
 Well, what we usually see 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.059
 there are 10,050 who have worn the player 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.250
 the last two years is the new 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.020
 10 050 generation is the boot 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.210
 synthetic made of material and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.769
 bridgetown with small inserts 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.509
 of text driver in the areas that enter 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.600
 in contact with the ball to get 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.460
 a good grip between the booty and the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 ball is a totally material 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.240
 Waterproof is manufactured in one piece 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.820
 is the smallest weight that we can 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.229
 find in a soccer boot and the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.060
 most important feature is the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.720
 union between the housing and the sole that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.720
 we will explain below 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.540
 The first thing we have to say is that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 the boot is presented with two templates 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.170
 different on the one hand the template 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.090
 conventional one that comes mounted 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.980
 directly on the boot that is a 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.600
 extremely lightweight template 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.520
 light that is what the player asks 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 Argentine but for the players that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.420
 look for a more conventional adidas thing 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.620
 gives a second option a second game 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.230
 of templates that comes within the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 box the comfort template that you name 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.760
 the brand that is a little more fluffy and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.620
 above all it has this finish with a 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.150
 velvet- like fabric that makes 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.940
 that when we put our foot on top of the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.310
 boot in no time we have any 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.770
 movement between the actions more 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.960
 aggressive however the most part 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.869
 important really to get this 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.760
 boot is the sprint frame this technology 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.340
 that we have been seeing for several seasons 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.780
 at 10,050 and characterized by 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.460
 direct connection of the heel and the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
 soles creating a sole of a profile 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.900
 very low a single perfectly flexible 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.910
 and stable twists with certain 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.160
 cushioning and especially on which 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.590
 you can ride the incredible sole with 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.540
 cast of tacos speed traction that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 means speed traction bending like 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.159
 we have been watching in previous seasons 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 It puts three edges of each control 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.269
 of the in each of the tacos the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.400
 finishing speed makes the edge more 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.959
 great is always the one that is going to have 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.939
 traction when we run to maximum 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.439
 speed in this way the support of 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.590
 the players at maximum speed is 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.540
 perfect with 50 difference already 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 you know the boots with which I read messi 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.280
 is going to start the season you have already 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.049
 approved and now we hope you get served 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.370
 so that we finally recover the talent 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.670
 that we have seen other years in the player 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.670
 Argentinian 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.019
 how
