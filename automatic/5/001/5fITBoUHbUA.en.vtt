00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 true media watch fake media 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.689
 that's how it happens in the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.689
 zoned 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:14.160
 yes here we have the merdias with 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.330
 we next to the media on the other side 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 the merdias we are guarding you are 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.810
 came in hidden camera ie 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.640
 there behind us so we have a chain of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 television which is probably the rtbf 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 so who introduced us to that to present 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.610
 his thesis this event that qualifies 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 as historical as the greatest 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 antisemitic congress since the second 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.059
 world war to you to tell you he 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 clear and tell ourselves we had not seen more 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 big before so I think they are 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 come filming us a bit like at the zoo 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.260
 so we on movies it's a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.680
 exchange 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.140
 So here we are at the rtbf before us so 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 here is my path that does not consume 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.469
 see this face to face is enough 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.199
 fantastic 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.600
 it shows see the kisses my rent 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
 on one side a second trip this world of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 the imagination and on the other side the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.010
 reality this is not bad like face to face 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 face 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:16.920
 he gave up besides full one goes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:20.350
 can win then here we have here the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.670
 French cream that came quickly 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 understands who is not too much of a dial 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.820
 the avenue of the polar circle all these people 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.350
 there are paid with our money 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.350
 small precision not bad 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 36 'anal canal then these are the sounds 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.540
 Russia are you going out you're not going 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.950
 this critical look at your work 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.480
 palma do not have the same meaning 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.040
 you find normal to treat by 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.720
 people whose example he set you 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.250
 think that there are people who will turn 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.880
 you on the fascists the march are 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.620
 Swiss and mittal has gone down but why 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.640
 is it if the crif and a10 by 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.890
 example I would like to understand the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 meaning of the phrase the far right 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.920
 pan-African as it has been described 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330
 strictly prescribes you do not know 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.649
 nothing yet you came here 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.090
 yes it was to see past month 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.680
 that's where you see the direct vision 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.030
 it's still a way 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 refused to answer questions when 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.170
 I answer that our days are reserved in 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.310
 his name I do not know the question one 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
 ask you why come if they 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 want to avoid the question why you 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 have come here while in the press 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.310
 and a campaign of slander against 7 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.769
 like this event by dealing 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.510
 of a congress rally between a 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.930
 hoard meeting is what my 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.150
 fascist heads 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.769
 we feel the dispatch I do not know where 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.540
 does not know what the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:48.010
 fascination too many stories I surrender 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.819
 account that unites them to other people are 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.409
 the kind of questions you are at the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.879
 face of each other's heart you feel a 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.650
 little bit reversed dallku trÃ©voux price 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.659
 who led the prom acquired show this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.889
 that you want to the rest of the people 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.989
 unfortunately who is obliged to you 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.280
 believe and where we will be able to will show 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.840
 the other face ie see 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.609
 distressed media as soon as they are asked the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.139
 good serious questions they are a 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.139
 little destabilized it's normal 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.920
 never breeds and trees 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.610
 it's at masters france with the brothers 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.610
 body it will be mine 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.480
 it's like that 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.950
 so I would like to understand why 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 bfm is a chain that constantly 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.430
 of propaganda and kines that is 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.230
 never in a hint of objectivity 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.209
 in any case something that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.439
 close to one of a real fact but 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.629
 always in a lie 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.829
 and for that it is enough to see the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.629
 many examples and we can ask 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.950
 for what is going on how do you 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.780
 did the treatment for example of 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.459
 the war in libya a game we had 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.810
 never explained cao cao that a moment 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.489
 that they were real 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.290
 jihadists of terrorists who were 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.060
 supported by NATO why is that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.889
 the NATO massacres were 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.389
 constantly hidden by bfm ie 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.919
 that there was still almost 200 thousand 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.319
 dead in this case but if I 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.969
 look bfm absolutely not a people who 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.739
 get free I would like to understand too 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.750
 why bfm when it comes to the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.969
 Syria makes us a treatment in us 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.859
 never explaining that these are 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.319
 terrorists of the companions nostra de al 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.989
 qaeda that are introduced by turkey 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.120
 who are infiltrated by aircraft from 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.009
 un its not because this is Anna 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.099
 financed by qatar by arabia 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.440
 Arabia that explains why fm 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.360
 never tell us more about 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.520
 the Ukrainian sphere there are parties 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.840
 as svoboda of the real Nazi because 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.070
 that the ease these are there low 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.580
 coming in but looking to 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.990
 Brussels 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.550
 now you have to go to Kiev that 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.159
 go get them there says she will own 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.300
 also ask why bfm no no this 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.740
 is not information about 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.110
 which snipers were found 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.880
 Israelis and NATO snipers on 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.650
 instead but to annex them who had 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.729
 shot at the crowd and who sowed the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.949
 chaos in which and Ukraine 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.349
 here I wish that bfm a little 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.120
 hold true media role 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.380
 journalists and explains to us what 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.380
 really goes around the world 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 then the employees 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.760
 how do you feel about work 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.729
 deceive the people is a vocation or 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.729
 do what is natural is not 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:21.860
 the arrival but on the other hand we know 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.050
 natural death or you are forced 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 it's just food or you 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.150
 do you really have convictions 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.139
 in what you say you do not have 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.240
 nothing to say bah you journalists 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.830
 have never to come obviously to note 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.180
 that bullshit so necessarily when 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.590
 we ask you smart questions 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.139
 you must silencer but me I 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.630
 ask a question madam 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.759
 so madam and it was natural kelly the 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.380
 collaboration of the merdias is what 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.360
 this distortion of reality that 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.919
 seems like I practice it and if 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.199
 Forcing or you have 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:06:01.280
 brothers the transie crowd of breeding 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:02.750
 you do not just mark the bank 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.729
 live see the atmosphere is pretty 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.759
 tense here it is tied the face-to-face 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.949
 media beats there is going to accentuate 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.650
 that is the beginning of a 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.479
 new era now the media are going 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.819
 face each other directly there will be two 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.130
 really pictures so as well 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.440
 we have this dichotomy at level two 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.620
 country between resistant collaborators 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.110
 low 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.630
 look here and the old ladies in her 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.440
 cotton center or simply we 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.199
 start serving 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.699
 it makes me think of the Indians 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.830
 of america that we start to resist 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.300
 today street shot and ben us 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.860
 we have our rifles they still have the time 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.000
 in front we'll have done their 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.620
 scared anyway 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.370
 blow there it is necessary that the fear changes of 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.370
 here is 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.520
 in the case 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900
 at 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.770
 or not 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.390
 finally 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.930
 no 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.930
 yes in fact
