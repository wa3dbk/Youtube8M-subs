00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.770 
feature with us but at this time we had
to<00:01:28.380> make<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> tough<00:01:28.979> decision<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.659> have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to make that tough decision and we have

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
to make that tough decision and we have
the<00:01:30.930> ability<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> set<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> molten

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the ability to set them down to a molten

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.550 
the ability to set them down to a molten
so<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.759> more<00:01:33.090> playing<00:01:33.299> times<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> also

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
so they get more playing times and also

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
so they get more playing times and also
but<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.369> know<00:01:35.490> they're<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.880> part<00:01:36.090> our

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
but we know they're going to be part our

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
but we know they're going to be part our
team<00:01:36.420> moving<00:01:36.570> forward<00:01:36.710> Brian<00:01:37.710> Flynn<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
team moving forward Brian Flynn what is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.830 
team moving forward Brian Flynn what is
it<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> bring<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it that you like about him to bring it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.359 
it that you like about him to bring it
is<00:01:40.079> smart<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.070> smart

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
is smart I think it's a very smart

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
is smart I think it's a very smart
hockey<00:01:41.549> player<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.390> right-hand<00:01:42.810> shot<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hockey player is a right-hand shot that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
hockey player is a right-hand shot that
could<00:01:43.290> play<00:01:43.439> center<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.009> wing<00:01:44.720> kill

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could play center and right wing kill

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
could play center and right wing kill
penalties<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.130> brings<00:01:47.310> uh<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
penalties also I think he brings uh I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.240 
penalties also I think he brings uh I
think<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.930> always<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> smart<00:01:49.710> smart<00:01:50.130> hockey

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
think we always like smart smart hockey

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
think we always like smart smart hockey
players<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.509> why<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.720> bring<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> our

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
players and that's why they bring to our

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.830 
players and that's why they bring to our
key<00:01:52.200> club<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.680> guess<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.329> playoff

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
key club and I guess with the playoff

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.399 
key club and I guess with the playoff
push<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> run<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.810> think

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
push we like to have in the run I think

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.649 
push we like to have in the run I think
that<00:01:58.890> position<00:01:59.640> yep<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.119> always<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> key

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that position yep it's always a key

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
that position yep it's always a key
factor<00:02:00.860> second<00:02:01.860> deal<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> Sabres<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
factor second deal with the Sabres is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
factor second deal with the Sabres is

excited there's a really good skater I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.570 
excited there's a really good skater I
think

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
think

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.090 
think
spin<00:02:10.759> mode<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.150> career<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.540> San<00:02:11.720> Jose

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
spin mode of this career in San Jose

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.640 
spin mode of this career in San Jose
also<00:02:13.100> could<00:02:13.280> play<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.460> wing<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.650> center

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
also could play the wing in the center

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.520 
also could play the wing in the center
position<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.160> right<00:02:16.310> shot<00:02:16.810> speed<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> key

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
position the right shot speed is a key

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.350 
position the right shot speed is a key
and<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:18.770> helps<00:02:19.460> really<00:02:19.640> push<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.000> defense

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
and that helps really push that defense

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.750 
and that helps really push that defense
back<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.840> he<00:02:21.560> plays<00:02:21.770> our<00:02:21.950> style<00:02:22.220> hockey<00:02:22.640> with

back and he plays our style hockey with

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.460 
back and he plays our style hockey with
the<00:02:22.850> high<00:02:22.940> pace<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.930> these<00:02:23.990> moves<00:02:24.200> have

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
the high pace some of these moves have

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.690 
the high pace some of these moves have
really<00:02:24.710> created<00:02:24.890> some<00:02:25.190> more<00:02:25.310> internal
