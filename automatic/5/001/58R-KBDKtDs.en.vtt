sitting<00:00:30.280> peaks<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.670> weak<00:00:30.820> do<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.770> right<00:00:32.770> now

sitting peaks and weak do and right now
we<00:00:33.039> see<00:00:33.430> that<00:00:34.030> tester<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:35.159> spawning<00:00:36.159> in<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
we see that tester is spawning in the

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.509 
we see that tester is spawning in the
bottom<00:00:36.879> left<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.359> i<00:00:38.109> love<00:00:38.469> OV<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.039> spawning<00:00:39.339> on

the top right now tell me good Joe do
you<00:00:44.469> think<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.899> map<00:00:47.170> had<00:00:48.420> being<00:00:49.420> a

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
you think that this map had being a

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.069 
you think that this map had being a
two-player<00:00:49.960> map<00:00:50.199> has<00:00:50.829> any<00:00:51.149> effect<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:52.479> the

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
two-player map has any effect on the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.349 
two-player map has any effect on the
early<00:00:53.409> gameplay<00:00:53.620> since<00:00:54.549> you<00:00:54.670> know<00:00:54.879> where<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
early gameplay since you know where the

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.110 
early gameplay since you know where the
opponent<00:00:56.139> is<00:00:58.889> well<00:00:59.889> I<00:00:59.920> think<00:01:00.309> any<00:01:00.760> two<00:01:00.969> player

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
opponent is well I think any two player

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.380 
opponent is well I think any two player
matic<00:01:01.539> makes<00:01:01.719> a<00:01:01.839> big<00:01:02.579> makes<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.699> big<00:01:03.879> deal<00:01:04.059> on

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
matic makes a big makes a big deal on

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.990 
matic makes a big makes a big deal on
the<00:01:04.770> play<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:05.979> happens<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.610> early<00:01:06.820> game

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
the play that happens in the early game

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.910 
the play that happens in the early game
but<00:01:07.240> really<00:01:07.570> since<00:01:07.840> peaks<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.289> big<00:01:08.500> do<00:01:08.680> have

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
but really since peaks that big do have

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.639 
but really since peaks that big do have
some<00:01:09.100> weird<00:01:09.310> pathing<00:01:09.759> issues<00:01:10.119> for<00:01:10.990> terran

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
some weird pathing issues for terran

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.950 
some weird pathing issues for terran
especially<00:01:12.189> except<00:01:13.000> for<00:01:13.180> smaller<00:01:13.420> units<00:01:13.810> such

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
especially except for smaller units such

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.160 
especially except for smaller units such
as<00:01:13.990> Marines<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:14.710> zealots<00:01:15.070> um<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.509> it's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
as Marines and zealots um and it's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.779 
as Marines and zealots um and it's
pretty<00:01:17.439> far<00:01:17.770> oh<00:01:17.829> you're<00:01:18.219> pretty<00:01:18.460> far<00:01:18.670> away

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
pretty far oh you're pretty far away

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.359 
pretty far oh you're pretty far away
from<00:01:19.060> your<00:01:19.210> opponent<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.810> don't<00:01:20.590> think<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:21.100> mean

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
from your opponent I don't think I mean

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.219 
from your opponent I don't think I mean
cheese<00:01:21.640> rush<00:01:21.909> is<00:01:22.060> definitely<00:01:22.570> viable<00:01:23.020> since

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
cheese rush is definitely viable since

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.690 
cheese rush is definitely viable since
it's<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.439> two-player<00:01:23.799> map<00:01:24.039> if<00:01:24.250> that's<00:01:24.579> what

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
it's a two-player map if that's what

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.999 
it's a two-player map if that's what
you're<00:01:24.880> asking<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:26.289> yeah<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:26.859> definitely

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
you're asking so yeah that definitely

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.760 
you're asking so yeah that definitely
affects<00:01:27.539> play<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.719> on<00:01:28.930> any<00:01:29.109> two<00:01:29.320> player<00:01:29.439> now

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
affects play it on any two player now

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.459 
affects play it on any two player now
the<00:01:30.369> early<00:01:30.640> gameplay<00:01:30.820> daiquiri<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.960> right<00:01:35.439> now

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
the early gameplay daiquiri so right now

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.899 
the early gameplay daiquiri so right now
we<00:01:35.710> see<00:01:36.280> some<00:01:36.490> pretty<00:01:36.759> nice<00:01:37.890> pro<00:01:38.890> passing<00:01:39.609> here

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
we see some pretty nice pro passing here

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.040 
we see some pretty nice pro passing here
by<00:01:40.530> tester<00:01:41.530> and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
by tester and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.560 
by tester and
um<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.100> delay<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.400> barracks<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> little

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
um this will delay the barracks a little

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.590 
um this will delay the barracks a little
bit<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.640> would<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.760> say<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:47.970> I'd<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.420> any

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
bit but would you say that I'd have any

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.680 
bit but would you say that I'd have any
long-term<00:01:49.320> effects<00:01:50.000> since<00:01:51.000> usually<00:01:51.480> we<00:01:51.570> don't

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
long-term effects since usually we don't

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.100 
long-term effects since usually we don't
really<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.230> any<00:01:52.850> early<00:01:53.850> game<00:01:54.060> pushes<00:01:54.900> or

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
really see any early game pushes or

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.310 
really see any early game pushes or
pressures<00:01:55.610> pressure<00:01:56.610> attacks<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.450> early<00:01:58.140> game

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
pressures pressure attacks in early game

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.490 
pressures pressure attacks in early game
by<00:01:58.560> both<00:01:58.830> Terran<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.820> Protoss<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> think

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
by both Terran and Protoss do you think

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
by both Terran and Protoss do you think
that<00:02:01.680> delaying<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.280> barracks<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.910> have<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that delaying that barracks will have a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.290 
that delaying that barracks will have a
bad<00:02:04.100> long-term<00:02:05.100> effect<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.910> just<00:02:06.000> be

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
bad long-term effect or would it just be

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.200 
bad long-term effect or would it just be
a<00:02:06.450> small<00:02:06.900> disadvantage<00:02:07.800> for<00:02:08.130> i<00:02:08.190> love<00:02:08.490> OV<00:02:11.210> he

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
a small disadvantage for i love OV he

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.660 
a small disadvantage for i love OV he
only<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.570> delayed<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.170> by<00:02:13.320> maybe<00:02:13.560> 5-10<00:02:14.250> seconds

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
only be delayed it by maybe 5-10 seconds

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.250 
only be delayed it by maybe 5-10 seconds
so<00:02:14.820> i<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.390> was<00:02:15.600> anything<00:02:15.840> really

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so i think that was anything really

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410 
so i think that was anything really
significant<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.100> mean<00:02:17.250> it'll<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.940> most<00:02:18.180> light

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
significant I mean it'll get most light

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960 
significant I mean it'll get most light
early<00:02:19.380> game<00:02:19.530> advantage<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.280> i<00:02:20.400> said<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
early game advantage but like i said the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.660 
early game advantage but like i said the
pathing<00:02:21.360> issues<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.960> map<00:02:22.260> um<00:02:23.100> usually

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
pathing issues on this map um usually

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.190 
pathing issues on this map um usually
doing<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.240> barracks<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.050> make<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
doing a barracks like that can make a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720 
doing a barracks like that can make a
difference<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.860> map<00:02:26.010> such<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.370> launching

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
difference on the map such as launching

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.630 
difference on the map such as launching
this<00:02:26.850> we're<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.570> there's<00:02:28.560> no<00:02:28.770> ramp<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.490> it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
this we're on there's no ramp so it's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.580 
this we're on there's no ramp so it's
really<00:02:29.850> hard<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.240> defend<00:02:30.510> against<00:02:30.840> ranges<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
really hard to defend against ranges and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.220 
really hard to defend against ranges and
goons<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.190> early<00:02:32.490> game<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.690> i<00:02:33.720> don't<00:02:34.080> think

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
goons in the early game so i don't think

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.480 
goons in the early game so i don't think
that<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.530> made<00:02:34.680> any<00:02:34.860> significant

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
that really made any significant

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.830 
that really made any significant
advantage<00:02:35.850> giving<00:02:36.150> them<00:02:36.240> out<00:02:37.250> yeah<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.810> i

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
advantage giving them out yeah and so i

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.250 
advantage giving them out yeah and so i
don't<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.500> i<00:02:40.770> love<00:02:40.980> o<00:02:41.130> V<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.610> walling<00:02:42.060> in

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
don't see that i love o V is walling in

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.930 
don't see that i love o V is walling in
mmm<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.770> going<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> prevent<00:02:44.370> early<00:02:44.640> game

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
mmm this is going to prevent early game

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.900 
mmm this is going to prevent early game
rushes<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> think<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.220> walling<00:02:47.640> in

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
rushes do you think that walling in

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.550 
rushes do you think that walling in
would<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.690> any<00:02:48.900> sort<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:50.959> wood<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.050> try<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
would have any sort of wood it try and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.150 
would have any sort of wood it try and
hit<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> hint<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.940> tester<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:55.530> possibly

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
hit what a hint to tester that possibly

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
hit what a hint to tester that possibly
i<00:02:56.250> love<00:02:56.520> OV<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.330> be<00:02:57.450> checking<00:02:57.600> to

Terrence wall in that much except on

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.760 
Terrence wall in that much except on
games<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.030> map<00:03:09.209> Longinus<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.620> it's

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
games like on the map Longinus or it's

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.490 
games like on the map Longinus or it's
very<00:03:10.980> easy<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.310> take<00:03:11.550> your<00:03:11.700> fast<00:03:11.910> expansion<00:03:12.500> so

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
very easy to take your fast expansion so

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.160 
very easy to take your fast expansion so
do<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.610> wall<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:14.940> would<00:03:15.330> hint<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
do you think this wall and would hint to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.840 
do you think this wall and would hint to
tester<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.860> something<00:03:17.340> strange<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.820> going

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
tester that something strange is going

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.390 
tester that something strange is going
on<00:03:18.180> or<00:03:18.360> not<00:03:20.510> whoa<00:03:21.510> less<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.739> for

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
on or not whoa less I don't think for

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100 
on or not whoa less I don't think for
what<00:03:23.550> he's<00:03:23.790> saying<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.120> he's<00:03:24.480> only<00:03:24.660> seen<00:03:24.870> one

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
what he's saying now he's only seen one

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.900 
what he's saying now he's only seen one
factory<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.920> his<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> probe<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.670> he's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
factory with his a probe that he's

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.850 
factory with his a probe that he's
keeping<00:03:27.209> alive<00:03:27.390> they're<00:03:27.600> very<00:03:27.870> well<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:28.770> it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
keeping alive they're very well but it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.830 
keeping alive they're very well but it
just<00:03:29.040> died<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.790> don't<00:03:30.300> think<00:03:30.450> he<00:03:30.690> would

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
just died but I don't think he would

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.810 
just died but I don't think he would
really<00:03:31.020> suspect<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.770> whole<00:03:32.160> lot<00:03:32.370> coming<00:03:32.700> from

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
really suspect a whole lot coming from

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.240 
really suspect a whole lot coming from
olive<00:03:33.270> OB<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> mean<00:03:34.020> even<00:03:34.680> though<00:03:34.800> walling<00:03:35.130> is

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
olive OB I mean even though walling is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
olive OB I mean even though walling is
it<00:03:35.400> too<00:03:35.520> common<00:03:35.880> nowadays<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.570> still<00:03:36.870> it's

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
it too common nowadays it's still it's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.740 
it too common nowadays it's still it's
still<00:03:37.260> done<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.980> perform<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.730> given<00:03:39.720> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
still done and perform and given that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.509 
still done and perform and given that
that<00:03:40.140> barracks<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.769> built<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.160> little<00:03:41.310> bit

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
that barracks was built a little bit

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.550 
that barracks was built a little bit
late<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.910> think<00:03:42.209> walling<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.050> bigger

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
late I think walling in right now bigger

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.130 
late I think walling in right now bigger
the<00:03:43.860> fov<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:45.150> case<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.660> any<00:03:45.780> sort<00:03:46.050> of

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
the fov just in case of any sort of

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.350 
the fov just in case of any sort of
early<00:03:46.320> game<00:03:46.590> pressure

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
early game pressure

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.630 
early game pressure
so<00:03:49.440> another<00:03:50.440> thing<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.890> was<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.190> wondering

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
so another thing I was just wondering

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.340 
so another thing I was just wondering
about<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.270> see<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.480> most<00:03:52.870> Terrans

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
about is that we see that most Terrans

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.440 
about is that we see that most Terrans
make<00:03:53.740> about<00:03:53.950> four<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.430> six<00:03:54.460> Marines<00:03:54.880> early

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
make about four to six Marines early

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.360 
make about four to six Marines early
game<00:03:55.660> but<00:03:56.380> they<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:56.710> use<00:03:57.010> them<00:03:57.190> for

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
game but they really don't use them for

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.730 
game but they really don't use them for
anything<00:03:57.580> they<00:03:58.570> just<00:03:58.600> keep<00:03:58.870> them<00:03:59.110> at<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.320> ramp

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
anything they just keep them at the ramp

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.710 
anything they just keep them at the ramp
or<00:03:59.950> their<00:04:00.070> choke<00:04:00.340> are<00:04:00.940> they<00:04:01.270> there<00:04:01.390> just<00:04:01.630> for

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
or their choke are they there just for

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.020 
or their choke are they there just for
defense<00:04:02.080> or<00:04:02.490> what<00:04:03.490> would<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.670> call<00:04:03.850> these

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
defense or what would you call these

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.660 
defense or what would you call these
units<00:04:04.360> because<00:04:04.870> I've<00:04:05.800> pretty<00:04:06.250> much<00:04:06.340> never

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
units because I've pretty much never

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.040 
units because I've pretty much never
seen<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:06.940> game<00:04:07.180> where<00:04:07.450> they've<00:04:07.600> been<00:04:07.630> used

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
seen a game where they've been used

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.250 
seen a game where they've been used
aggressively<00:04:08.910> except<00:04:09.910> in<00:04:10.150> innovative<00:04:10.900> builds

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
aggressively except in innovative builds

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.550

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.640 
such as when people such as nada or up
magic<00:04:14.980> are<00:04:15.130> playing<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:16.390> what<00:04:17.290> do<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.470> think

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
magic are playing so what do you think

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.070 
magic are playing so what do you think
the<00:04:17.800> early<00:04:18.160> game<00:04:18.310> use<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.330> marine<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.780> well

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080

really just in case a tester decides to

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
early game pressure on and we know if he

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.090 
early game pressure on and we know if he
moved<00:05:03.310> if<00:05:03.550> all<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.660> expands<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.470> puts<00:05:05.530> his

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
tank and his marines outside puts a tank

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.050 
tank and his marines outside puts a tank
if<00:05:08.500> he<00:05:08.710> only<00:05:08.890> had<00:05:09.100> a<00:05:09.130> tank<00:05:09.400> outside<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.820> ramp

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
if he only had a tank outside of ramp

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.270 
if he only had a tank outside of ramp
two<00:05:10.960> or<00:05:11.110> three<00:05:11.140> two<00:05:11.410> guns<00:05:11.590> could<00:05:11.770> easily<00:05:12.130> take

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
two or three two guns could easily take

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.550 
two or three two guns could easily take
out<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:13.180> tank<00:05:13.720> is<00:05:13.870> called<00:05:14.050> serious

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
out that a tank is called serious

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.890 
out that a tank is called serious
problems<00:05:15.010> for<00:05:15.190> OV<00:05:15.610> he<00:05:16.300> would<00:05:16.450> have<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> pull<00:05:16.870> a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
problems for OV he would have to pull a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.440 
problems for OV he would have to pull a
CVS<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.590> all<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:17.830> counts<00:05:17.980> of<00:05:18.160> crazy<00:05:18.490> so

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
CVS and all that counts of crazy so

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.240 
CVS and all that counts of crazy so
having<00:05:20.290> those<00:05:20.380> Marines<00:05:20.740> there<00:05:20.920> is<00:05:21.010> really

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
having those Marines there is really

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.040 
having those Marines there is really
just<00:05:21.460> in<00:05:21.640> case<00:05:21.850> tester<00:05:22.270> decides<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:22.720> put<00:05:22.930> on

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
just in case tester decides to put on

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.090 
just in case tester decides to put on
early<00:05:23.350> game<00:05:23.650> pressure<00:05:23.950> I<00:05:24.280> see<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:26.100> another

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
early game pressure I see and another

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.870 
early game pressure I see and another
question<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.610> have<00:05:28.860> we<00:05:29.860> saw<00:05:30.100> that<00:05:30.130> tester<00:05:30.700> got<00:05:30.850> a

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
question I have we saw that tester got a

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.670 
question I have we saw that tester got a
really<00:05:31.150> early<00:05:31.540> natural<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.470> really

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
really early natural and you really

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.080 
really early natural and you really
didn't<00:05:32.890> have<00:05:32.920> many<00:05:33.160> units<00:05:33.520> he<00:05:33.640> only<00:05:33.850> had<00:05:34.060> a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
didn't have many units he only had a

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.760 
didn't have many units he only had a
good<00:05:34.660> or<00:05:34.810> two<00:05:35.190> hmm<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:37.320> would<00:05:38.320> this<00:05:38.500> be<00:05:38.740> a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
good or two hmm so would this be a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.410 
good or two hmm so would this be a
little<00:05:39.010> bit<00:05:39.160> risky<00:05:39.580> as<00:05:39.790> you<00:05:40.000> said<00:05:40.210> those

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
little bit risky as you said those

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.930 
little bit risky as you said those
remains<00:05:40.840> were<00:05:41.140> just<00:05:41.500> in<00:05:41.650> case<00:05:41.860> units

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.910 

well<00:05:47.600> I<00:05:47.630> really<00:05:48.110> think<00:05:48.320> since<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:48.890> was

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
well I really think since I was

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.680 
well I really think since I was
explaining<00:05:49.400> earlier<00:05:49.670> that<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.120> pathing<00:05:50.570> on

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
explaining earlier that the pathing on

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.110 
explaining earlier that the pathing on
this<00:05:50.810> math<00:05:51.020> is<00:05:51.260> so<00:05:51.410> strange<00:05:51.770> that<00:05:52.010> no<00:05:52.550> big<00:05:52.790> unit

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
this math is so strange that no big unit

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.530 
this math is so strange that no big unit
such<00:05:53.330> as<00:05:53.540> vultures<00:05:54.200> or<00:05:54.530> on<00:05:55.210> tanks<00:05:56.210> can<00:05:56.420> go

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
such as vultures or on tanks can go

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.880 
such as vultures or on tanks can go
through<00:05:56.720> the<00:05:56.810> middle<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.230> any<00:05:57.410> Marines<00:05:57.800> that

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
through the middle and any Marines that

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.020 
through the middle and any Marines that
went<00:05:58.130> through<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.310> middle<00:05:58.550> really<00:05:58.790> wouldn't

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
went through the middle really wouldn't

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.680 
went through the middle really wouldn't
be<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.120> threat<00:05:59.920> but<00:06:01.000> yeah<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:02.030> don't<00:06:02.210> think<00:06:02.390> test

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
be a threat but yeah I don't think test

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.480 
be a threat but yeah I don't think test
is<00:06:02.810> really<00:06:03.080> too<00:06:03.230> worried<00:06:03.440> about<00:06:03.530> any<00:06:03.830> early

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
is really too worried about any early

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.770 
is really too worried about any early
game<00:06:04.640> pressure<00:06:04.880> since<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.330> natural<00:06:05.720> is

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
game pressure since that natural is

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.330 
game pressure since that natural is
really<00:06:06.050> easy<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.440> defend<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:07.040> could<00:06:07.190> stay

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
really easy to defend you could stay

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.950 
really easy to defend you could stay
fairly<00:06:07.640> close<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.090> your<00:06:08.210> ramp<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.630> your<00:06:08.780> main

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
fairly close to your ramp to your main

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.530 
fairly close to your ramp to your main
so<00:06:09.320> Walters<00:06:09.710> don't<00:06:09.920> run<00:06:10.070> up<00:06:10.220> and<00:06:10.430> still<00:06:11.420> be

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
so Walters don't run up and still be

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.820 
so Walters don't run up and still be
able<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.780> defend<00:06:11.960> your<00:06:12.140> natural<00:06:12.500> fairly

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
able to defend your natural fairly

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.620 
able to defend your natural fairly
easily<00:06:14.920> yeah<00:06:15.920> i<00:06:15.950> think<00:06:16.250> that<00:06:16.520> early<00:06:17.180> natural

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
easily yeah i think that early natural

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.470 
easily yeah i think that early natural
was<00:06:18.020> really<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.680> small<00:06:19.580> turning<00:06:20.000> point<00:06:20.240> in<00:06:20.360> the

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
was really a small turning point in the

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.320 
was really a small turning point in the
game<00:06:20.510> because<00:06:21.580> tester<00:06:22.580> would<00:06:22.730> be<00:06:22.850> able<00:06:22.940> to<00:06:23.150> get

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
game because tester would be able to get

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.160 
game because tester would be able to get
his<00:06:23.570> macro<00:06:24.140> up<00:06:24.200> quite<00:06:25.040> a<00:06:25.070> bit<00:06:25.280> better<00:06:25.610> than<00:06:26.540> I

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
his macro up quite a bit better than I

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.750 
his macro up quite a bit better than I
love<00:06:27.590> ov<00:06:28.040> what<00:06:28.250> would<00:06:28.700> because<00:06:29.540> I<00:06:29.780> love<00:06:29.960> ovies

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
love ov what would because I love ovies

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.640 
love ov what would because I love ovies
command<00:06:31.760> center<00:06:32.030> was<00:06:32.150> a<00:06:32.180> bit<00:06:32.420> later<00:06:32.660> though<00:06:33.590> it

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
command center was a bit later though it

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.270 
command center was a bit later though it
wasn't<00:06:33.800> that<00:06:34.100> much<00:06:34.370> behind<00:06:34.670> so<00:06:36.190> do<00:06:37.190> you<00:06:37.250> think

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
wasn't that much behind so do you think

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.180 
wasn't that much behind so do you think
that<00:06:38.380> tester<00:06:39.380> got<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:39.590> little<00:06:39.770> bit<00:06:39.950> of<00:06:40.070> an

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
that tester got a little bit of an

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.560 
that tester got a little bit of an
advantage<00:06:40.430> or<00:06:40.910> do<00:06:40.970> you<00:06:41.030> think<00:06:41.180> they're<00:06:41.300> sort

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
advantage or do you think they're sort

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.960 
advantage or do you think they're sort
of<00:06:41.600> Ian<00:06:41.930> even<00:06:42.290> at<00:06:42.410> this<00:06:42.530> point<00:06:45.670> it's<00:06:46.670> a<00:06:46.760> very

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
of Ian even at this point it's a very

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.240 
of Ian even at this point it's a very
small<00:06:47.150> advantage<00:06:47.810> but<00:06:48.470> I<00:06:48.650> do<00:06:48.770> think<00:06:49.160> that

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
small advantage but I do think that

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.100 
small advantage but I do think that
tester<00:06:49.730> would<00:06:50.000> be<00:06:50.240> ahead<00:06:50.330> right<00:06:50.540> about<00:06:50.930> now

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
tester would be ahead right about now

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.810 
tester would be ahead right about now
just<00:06:51.740> because<00:06:52.040> he's<00:06:52.190> about<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.430> take<00:06:52.700> his

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
just because he's about to take his

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.630 
just because he's about to take his
third<00:06:53.000> expansion<00:06:53.270> as<00:06:53.570> we<00:06:53.720> can<00:06:53.870> see<00:06:53.990> here<00:06:54.400> but<00:06:55.400> I

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
third expansion as we can see here but I

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.390 
third expansion as we can see here but I
mean<00:06:55.820> it's<00:06:56.150> really<00:06:56.690> not<00:06:57.230> too<00:06:57.290> big<00:06:57.620> of<00:06:57.650> a<00:06:57.890> lead

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
mean it's really not too big of a lead

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.700 
mean it's really not too big of a lead
tester<00:06:58.940> has<00:06:59.120> it's<00:06:59.510> not<00:06:59.780> it's<00:07:00.050> nothing<00:07:00.470> to

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
tester has it's not it's nothing to

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.400 
tester has it's not it's nothing to
really<00:07:00.950> say<00:07:01.850> that<00:07:02.090> OB<00:07:02.540> had<00:07:02.780> such<00:07:03.080> a<00:07:03.110> late

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
really say that OB had such a late

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.020 
really say that OB had such a late
command<00:07:03.740> center<00:07:03.980> or<00:07:04.040> such<00:07:04.310> a<00:07:04.340> late<00:07:04.610> factory

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
command center or such a late factory

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.580 
command center or such a late factory
that<00:07:05.300> it<00:07:05.390> really<00:07:05.570> caught<00:07:05.900> it's<00:07:06.169> going<00:07:06.350> to<00:07:06.440> cost

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
that it really caught it's going to cost

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.830 
that it really caught it's going to cost
him<00:07:06.770> the<00:07:06.860> game<00:07:06.950> or<00:07:07.250> anything<00:07:07.580> so<00:07:08.390> something

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
him the game or anything so something

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.900 
him the game or anything so something
really<00:07:09.050> significant<00:07:10.570> yeah<00:07:11.570> and<00:07:12.400> a<00:07:13.400> little<00:07:13.850> bit

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
really significant yeah and a little bit

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.339 
really significant yeah and a little bit
earlier<00:07:14.210> I<00:07:14.300> just<00:07:14.390> saw<00:07:14.720> an<00:07:15.020> academy<00:07:15.650> and

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.200 

that's<00:07:20.349> actually<00:07:21.160> actually<00:07:21.580> something<00:07:22.030> I

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
that's actually actually something I

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.270 
that's actually actually something I
have<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.330> say<00:07:22.539> right<00:07:22.690> now<00:07:22.870> is<00:07:22.900> that<00:07:23.080> I<00:07:23.500> love<00:07:24.130> oh

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 
have to say right now is that I love oh

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.430 
have to say right now is that I love oh
he<00:07:24.639> really<00:07:24.940> has<00:07:25.210> a<00:07:25.240> very<00:07:25.569> low<00:07:25.870> amount<00:07:26.050> of

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
he really has a very low amount of

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.409 
he really has a very low amount of
factories<00:07:26.919> right<00:07:27.130> now<00:07:27.310> and<00:07:27.610> something<00:07:28.180> that<00:07:28.300> I

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
factories right now and something that I

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.140 
factories right now and something that I
think<00:07:28.750> really<00:07:28.810> affected<00:07:29.530> this<00:07:29.650> game<00:07:29.889> was<00:07:30.250> he

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
think really affected this game was he

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.919 
think really affected this game was he
just<00:07:31.330> did<00:07:31.509> oh<00:07:31.720> forgot<00:07:32.470> cause<00:07:32.740> this
