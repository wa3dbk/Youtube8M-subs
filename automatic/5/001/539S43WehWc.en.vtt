phases<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> turn<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.579> before<00:01:45.060> combat<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
phases in a turn one before combat and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.319 
phases in a turn one before combat and
one<00:01:46.140> actor<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.119> play<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
one actor it's my turn so I can play a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.660 
one actor it's my turn so I can play a
land<00:01:48.630> during<00:01:48.899> either<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.530> main<00:01:49.740> phases<00:01:50.009> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
land during either of my main phases but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.239 
land during either of my main phases but
only<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.539> land<00:01:51.810> per<00:01:52.200> turn<00:01:52.439> I'll<00:01:52.679> go<00:01:52.890> ahead<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
only one land per turn I'll go ahead and

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.310 
only one land per turn I'll go ahead and
play<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.429> forest<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.749> have<00:01:54.840> access<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
play a forest now so I have access to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
play a forest now so I have access to
that<00:01:55.439> mana<00:01:55.679> should<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.159> need<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> during<00:01:56.729> combat

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that mana should I need it during combat

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
that mana should I need it during combat
it's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> good<00:01:57.600> point<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.109> can<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.590> play<00:01:58.859> other

it's a good point I can also play other
spells<00:01:59.310> during<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.670> main<00:01:59.880> phase<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:01.140> I'll

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
attack now would be the time to do so

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.759 
attack now would be the time to do so
well<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.359> move<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.659> to<00:02:46.810> declare<00:02:47.019> attackers

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
well then move on to declare attackers

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.860 
well then move on to declare attackers
it's<00:02:48.129> my<00:02:48.370> turn<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.120> choose<00:02:49.329> which<00:02:49.659> of<00:02:49.690> my

can't attack because it has summoning
thickness<00:02:54.819> meaning<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.780> entered<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
thickness meaning it just entered the

features can't attack though and that
sounds<00:02:59.859> like<00:02:59.889> a<00:03:00.040> good<00:03:00.220> idea<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.579> make<00:03:00.790> only

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
sounds like a good idea to make only

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.300 
sounds like a good idea to make only
untapped<00:03:01.840> creatures<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.379> attack<00:03:02.650> when<00:03:03.220> you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
untapped creatures can attack when you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.309 
untapped creatures can attack when you

has a couple of steps the first is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.570 
has a couple of steps the first is
called<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.660> end<00:05:25.870> step<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:27.160> is<00:05:27.220> another

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
called the end step and this is another

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.430 
called the end step and this is another
one<00:05:27.790> of<00:05:27.880> those<00:05:27.970> steps<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.630> something<00:05:29.229> might

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
one of those steps that something might

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.469 
one of those steps that something might
not<00:05:29.590> always<00:05:29.770> happen<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.669> cards<00:05:31.180> can<00:05:31.330> say

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
not always happen but cards can say

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.420 
not always happen but cards can say
otherwise<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.770> also<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.190> last

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
otherwise and this is also the last

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.700 
otherwise and this is also the last
chance<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.970> either<00:05:34.150> player<00:05:34.510> has<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:35.289> cast<00:05:35.530> an

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
chance that either player has to cast an

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.800 
chance that either player has to cast an
instant<00:05:36.070> or<00:05:36.280> activate<00:05:36.789> an<00:05:36.850> ability<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.539> finish

up the turn we now go to the cleanup
step<00:05:39.669> first<00:05:40.630> because<00:05:41.050> it's<00:05:41.169> my<00:05:41.320> turn<00:05:41.350> I<00:05:41.860> check

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
step first because it's my turn I check

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.040 
step first because it's my turn I check
to<00:05:42.430> see<00:05:42.460> if<00:05:42.610> I<00:05:42.789> have<00:05:42.940> more<00:05:43.360> than<00:05:43.510> seven<00:05:43.780> cards

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
in my hand if I do then I need to choose

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.750 
in my hand if I do then I need to choose
and<00:05:47.080> discard<00:05:47.440> cards<00:05:47.650> until<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:48.280> only<00:05:48.520> have

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
steps now only Dylan has to do this

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.950 
steps now only Dylan has to do this
because<00:05:51.010> it's<00:05:51.280> his<00:05:51.430> turn<00:05:51.669> right<00:05:52.270> now<00:05:52.390> I<00:05:52.660> can
