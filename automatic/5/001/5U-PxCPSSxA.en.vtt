00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.539
 in the second I want to teach you a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.670
 nail style that I loved and said 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.310
 good why not do this style is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.759
 super easy and nice to do this is the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.669
 network style and the truth I will not put my 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.220
 10 minutes in making this decoration is 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.960
 super easy and very beautiful and the best of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 yes since it is done with this kind of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.400
 Take off that is good that I have my 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 house just grabs it and cut some 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.199
 small pieces but you can put to use and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 you can make many designs with this or 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.280
 the colors that you want to use and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.500
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.390
 let's start by putting an advance of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 dark varnish in this case I used 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.710
 black and one fingernail and paint it another color 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.809
 so that I would not be seen in all the same 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.550
 then I'm going to grab a sponge 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.559
 sponges are good bathroom what 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.479
 we need is the network then I'm going to 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.479
 cut a piece of the same sheet of bath 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.180
 since I have this I am going to stretch it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 not so much so that they open a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.440
 little now I will use a sponge 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
 makeup and a clear varnish in this 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.940
 I'm going to use silver I'm going to put 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 a little varnish and in this part of 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.890
 our sponge does not have to be so 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 wet then I will remove the excess 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 of varnish now asks for help area for 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 that the network supports you and with small 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.110
 touches you're going to paint all yours does not matter 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.110
 if you pass after we clean it 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.810
 Now that you're done, you're going to remove the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.640
 network carefully and this way you will be 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.410
 and you do the same with all your nails 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.660
 it matters if you do not have all couples left 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.430
 for example look at this I do not stay the same 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.560
 than the others but still maintains the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.960
 This network effect happened because sometimes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.240
 we stretch the net more in some nails than in 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 others but do not worry it's still 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.170
 the same technique and you will have a good 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.120
 result now with a cotton and a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.880
 sponge with acetone let's clean 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.440
 around our nail take the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.509
 as long as you want in this part 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.880
 remember that when we decorate our 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.830
 dreams the details is the most important thing 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 and so our signs are with a 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.080
 beautiful network effect 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.939
 and they liked this beautiful idea 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.799
 because when I saw it I loved it 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.840
 direct then if I have the pater in my 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.360
 because I do not give it to him in signs and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 you can use it with colors that 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.769
 want you are thinking of various ideas of 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.540
 what can you teach them and 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.890

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.599
 fourth and if I do not like it so that you 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.579

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.180
 happy every time I do these 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 tutorials is to see that you do it and 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.319
 that they take a picture and send it to me 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.109
 my facebook to my twitter or my instagram 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.480
 I really love that and they do not do it 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.790
 like I want to teach them more things more 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.920

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.370
