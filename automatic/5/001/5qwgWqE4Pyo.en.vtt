00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.890

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.599
 it happened but they left it from the factory but 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.460
 looking online I found this 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.410
 recipe and today I will teach it to 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.540
 that you do it because internet 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.029
 it serves for that teaches you how to do 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.309
 from a Milanese to how to make a

 bomb and kill 50 people the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.640
 ingredients to make cookies 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.780
 they are flour baking powder 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 baking soda butter sugar 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.340
 eggs and vanilla essence and to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.340
 do we need foam vanilla 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.960
 water honey clear sugar and gelatin if not 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.450

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.540

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 this video is all the quantities 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.340
 exact of this recipe if you want to see

 better this video click here below and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.090
 change the configuration because hd is not going 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.810
 to see how 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.969
 of television in hd but something better is 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.700
 will see and before starting with this 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.859
 recipe I would like to tell you about the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.630
 silver and that a few days ago there was a 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.049
 great flood so if you want 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.209
 collaborate down here left some links for 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.549
 that can collaborate seven weeks 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.890
 thanks first thing to do is 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.439
 a sandblasted with butter and sugar 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.539
 then add the eggs and vanilla 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.530
 and finally all the ingredients 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.530
 sieved dry 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.930
 Y 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.159
 Once the dough is made, take it to 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.290
 rest to the hillside for 30 minutes a 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.150
 Once the dough is cold, the stretched ones 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.799
 of a thickness of approximately 2 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.120
 centimeters and the cut with a 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.170
 cutting 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.599
 circular in this case I use a number 4 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.840
 because it is an ideal size to eat a 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.000
 bocadito 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.000
 you cut the size you want 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 ah 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.070
 Y 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.590
 click all the caps and take it to a 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.590
 180 degree oven for about 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.730
 10 minutes to make the foam 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.099
 vanilla the first thing you have to do 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.019
 is to hydrate the gelatin in the water 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.909
 remember that the amount of water that 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.099
 you need to hydrate the gelatin is 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.340
 five times the weight of creatine without 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.340
 taste 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.850
 on the other hand we put in a saucepan the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.120
 sugar with water to make a syrup 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.910
 at 118 degrees when I put it is the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.190
 honey try to make it pure honey not that 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.750
 which has as corn syrup because it is 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.210
 andres pure honey and what's more 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.310
 horrible a way to know if your skin 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.200
 is pure or not is that at some point 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.000
 they call hardness if it never hardens is 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.150
 because it's mixed with corn syrup 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.940
 and it is also a technique to know if 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.800
 you're at 118 degrees is that 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.470
 you have to make bubbles with the same 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.860
 syrup for that we're going to use something 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.930
 similar to this a wire quoted or something 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.669
 have a circuit to be able to do 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.500
 bubbles can also be something of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.500
 wood this is the point of the syrup 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.690
 Y 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.970
 in the syrup we throw the gelatin 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.970
 hydrated 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.790
 ah 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.019
 once you touch the bowl of your blender 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.809
 and it's cold that means that the 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:40.149
 preparation is now ready and you are going to 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:42.509
 place in a sleeve with smooth beak as 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.509
 this time 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.110
 candy originally had in his 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.120
 center a strawberry heart so 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.150
 you put him 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.650
 in the center jam of strawberry 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.190
 raspberry or in this case I put it on 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.190
 ah 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.090
 ah 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.090
 a mine 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.979
 I do not like merengue 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.770
 once you complete all the bases 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.569
 there the cuckoo sounded once you complete 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.060
 of all the bases with the cream of 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.789
 vanilla let it dry at room temperature 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.830
 environment for an hour and if you're very 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.110
 anxious you take her for half an hour to the 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.970
 refrigerator once they are dry 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.970
 dipped in a cover 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.180
 Y 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.419
