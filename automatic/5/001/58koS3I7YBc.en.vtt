00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone quite often asked 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.309
 how to install the beta version here 10 10 4 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.450
 on although at the moment operating 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 system and remove 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.540
 latest version 1010 3 and honestly 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.560
 I don't know why you should test 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.100
 beta because firstly they 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 unstable and learn to wait 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 final release 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.519
 but still no one wants after all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 test who can not wait is done 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 it is very satisfied simple you go on 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 Appleâ€™s website, by the way, can 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.430
 link below video give 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 here it is recommended to create a backup 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 copying the thought function works for you 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.930
 time machines if not well then you will 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 install immediately no beta version without 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.050
 backup you download here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.629
 here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.090
 This utility is small 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.809
 utility 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.250
 it weighs less than one meter let me 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.250
 I'll see what we installed 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.230
 run the utility install in one 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.230
 username password 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.870
 after you are third with us 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 established we press update and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.210
 installation is already complete 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:40.610
 we have a badge 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.910
 this is apple's feedback we 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.230
 accept license agreement 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.230
 enter your and go 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.950
 here you can already write messages to write 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.740
 your feedback is generally all you think about 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.420
 new beta version 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.180
 well now let's go in 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.050
 update as you can see after i 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.720
 all made here, I had 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.070
 possibility to download in my update 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.290

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.010
 Makar I will at the moment 10 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.930
 10 4 version 14 sep on the 17th 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.330
 but again I do not advise you to do 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.240
 However, if you can not wait to see 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.330

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.760
