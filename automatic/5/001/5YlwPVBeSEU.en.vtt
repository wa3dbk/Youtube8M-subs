one reason the Whaler the old whalers
are<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.870> strong<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.890> last<00:02:33.340> forever<00:02:33.790> is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
are so strong and last forever is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.140 
are so strong and last forever is
because<00:02:34.680> he<00:02:35.680> did<00:02:35.890> not<00:02:36.070> subscribe<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> idea

because he did not subscribe to the idea

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
because he did not subscribe to the idea
use<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.350> up<00:02:38.500> throw<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:38.830> out<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.400> another<00:02:39.730> he

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
use it up throw it out get another he

use it up throw it out get another he
wanted<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:42.040> build<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.489> right<00:02:43.330> take<00:02:43.900> care<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.350> it

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
wanted to build it right take care of it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
wanted to build it right take care of it
and<00:02:44.620> make<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.950> last<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:47.170> was<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> lot<00:02:47.799> of

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
and make it last there was a lot of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.300 
and make it last there was a lot of
development<00:02:48.850> work<00:02:48.959> before<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:50.410> came<00:02:51.070> up

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310

with<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> concept<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.570> 13-footer<00:02:53.500> he

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
with the concept for the 13-footer he

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.210 
with the concept for the 13-footer he
initially<00:02:54.760> tried<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.600> make<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.100> a

I know that Ray Hunt looked at the Pope
and<00:03:04.640> advised<00:03:05.239> dad<00:03:05.660> there's<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.470> lot<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.890> sail

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
and advised dad there's a lot of sail

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.910 
and advised dad there's a lot of sail
fishes<00:03:07.940> around<00:03:08.269> but<00:03:08.540> there's<00:03:08.830> thousands<00:03:09.830> of

fishes around but there's thousands of
motor<00:03:10.129> boats<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.700> if<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.569> want<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.900> start<00:03:12.170> a

in<00:03:14.690> power<00:03:15.050> boats<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:17.000> must<00:03:17.239> have

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
in power boats and it must have

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.220 
in power boats and it must have

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.640 
convinced dad in ray hunt introduced
that<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:21.980> Hickman<00:03:22.519> see<00:03:22.849> slit<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.840> they

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
that to this Hickman see slit and they

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.470 
that to this Hickman see slit and they
work<00:03:24.830> together<00:03:25.040> on<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.700> design<00:03:26.090> which

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
work together on the design which

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.309 
work together on the design which
ultimately<00:03:27.349> became<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.700> 13-footer<00:03:29.599> they

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
ultimately became a 13-footer they

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.789 
ultimately became a 13-footer they
introduced<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.250> central<00:03:31.849> heat<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.230> hull<00:03:33.440> so

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
introduced a central heat to the hull so

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.740 
introduced a central heat to the hull so
it<00:03:33.860> became<00:03:34.250> kind<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> triple<00:03:35.330> V<00:03:35.480> instead

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
it became kind of but a triple V instead

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.539 
it became kind of but a triple V instead
of<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.319> two<00:03:36.730> parallel<00:03:37.730> sponsons<00:03:39.549> Boston

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
mix up the phone and pour it in a big

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.990 
mix up the phone and pour it in a big

valves and it's fill up that hall and in

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.570 
valves and it's fill up that hall and in
about<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.300> think<00:04:35.690> they<00:04:35.930> had<00:04:36.050> 30<00:04:36.320> seconds<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.070> mix

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
about I think they had 30 seconds to mix

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.020 
about I think they had 30 seconds to mix
the<00:04:37.850> stops<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.660> another<00:04:39.139> 30<00:04:39.590> or<00:04:39.740> minute<00:04:40.729> or<00:04:40.850> so

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
the stops and another 30 or minute or so

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.719 
the stops and another 30 or minute or so
to<00:04:41.090> get<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.479> pour<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.810> in

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
to get it pour it in

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.600 
to get it pour it in
that<00:04:43.330> came<00:04:43.539> out<00:04:43.749> the<00:04:44.080> little<00:04:44.349> vent<00:04:45.069> holes<00:04:45.309> in

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that came out the little vent holes in
