00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 naval engineering but today on the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.189
 option goes well away from the drawing boards and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.920
 calculations using modeling clay 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.160
 adami and a lot of skill 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.690
 besides the river produces handicrafts 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 comic book character 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 Japanese drawings and movies 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 the result is incredible just give a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 Look at these dolls Saved Jobs 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.590
 very big right? 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 They are made in a structure polystyrene 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 of this Styrofoam carved in the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.129
 stylus and styrofoam he will receive a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 treatment of plastic mass as the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.410
 internet or by isola agent is with plaster 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.649
 another had this figure she sums up well 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 these make everyone knows that styrofoam 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.489
 and a piece of it has already been plaster in some 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 earlier since the plastic mass 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 in the head and in the details 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 olindo uses another kind of dough 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 which is easier to model when you work 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.280
 very delicate that it is your Guarani that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 Give support to parties a little 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 used because almost nobody does this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.830
 kind of thumbnail like an ink can 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.350
 retelled in felipe simas sesi blades 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 to make the hair of a miniature 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 now one more pound of all this is that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.299
 the sculptures are made so in one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.790
 using only drawings such as 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.009
 reference this drawing the lane was 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 very old is that since then I found 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.430
 references 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.430
 I took the television one scene. 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.430
 it is a gift because it comes right 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.420
 in addition to all illustrations with the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.340
 color right 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 has a part they call annoying 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.450
 technique, right? 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.700
 so here we have a design in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.460
 black and white even with all 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.820
 details of the doll and it seems that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.950
 more information and has more 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.930
 character building 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.630
 This woman, for example, took too long. 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.760
 It was if I caught it straight that it did not lose 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.030
 Why robinson pereira has time? 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.790
 I leave in days or a month and another doll 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 along with the political dragon lion nothing 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.480
 less than a year is a year to 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.670
 work as painstakingly as 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.730
 this must have a quality 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.560
 fundamental is the courage to end one 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.780
 business of this month we start does not have 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.290
 Courage ends then I think patience 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:48.440
 is the fifth and most important 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.720
 Japanese characters his Julian colleague 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 works and has fun 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.989
 creating space-based spaceships 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.360
 fiction films your basic material with 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.130
 those who use plastics used by 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.410
 aeromodelling 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.120
 I make a certain selection of that. 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.800
 even buying with us until this 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.440
 leave the study at my disposal 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.209
 I'm going to ask to go. 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.860
 work something that we are looking for 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.880
 so it's the one who 's watching not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.040
 acknowledge 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.170
 as it used a plane here right but 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.090
 what ends up happening even I think 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.430
 that this one always looks really good that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.650
 it is made with the fuselage of a 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.140
 plane is upside down right he is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.450
 head down and was adding 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.880
 ship or which have shaped parts 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.070
 one out this plus a lot of pecks 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.239
 smaller ones that use for detailing 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.239
 Son, right? 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.870
 the high it helps so much to improve the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.030
 model can spoil it too 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.930
 and in my case in particular I use a 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.989
 finish is used neither I want to give a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.100
 Dude this came in and out of 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:03.360
 atmospheres had collided with things 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.190
 by space is chased takes shot and is 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.420
 more or less inspired by the work with 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:13.220
 the staff of jorge lucas his team 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.220
 I wanted to give the government an injury. 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:24.870
 so in this scheme and then see how 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.819
 It's going to get painted, more or less. 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.789
 I am seeking the same right 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:33.139
 and to realize the perfection of work 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.090
 Julian, just take a look at this davi 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.330
 just like the one in the movie 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.330
 aliens the ransom 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.650
 it's bullshit to think that I sure know 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.630
 but even then it was very do not have 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 I also did not end up with iron. 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.820
 confessing that much of this is happening and has 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.450
 things that we apprehend you finish 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.770
 experimenting and cool oil did not give 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.770
 ended up going the way I wanted
