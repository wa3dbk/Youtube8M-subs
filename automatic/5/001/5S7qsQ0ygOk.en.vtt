 Some of you also said that about my 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 audio my audio it was kind of bad 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.740
 in the latest videos I understand this 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 but my 77 is not a non-headset. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 I know what configuration I have to use 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.719
 For you, it is improving because the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.630
 the other is 7 that I had 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.840
 he spoiled that they were 21 fish that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.170
 2011 excellent audio fish and I am 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.679
 now with a 7.1 handset and another is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.120
 to get there but I do not know when and why 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.520
 while I'm going to have to record something 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.710
 right here 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.850
 but look and the audio has improved. I'm going 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.860
 believe in him here at Christmas of the acit 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.690

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.670
 and many of you have given me more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.960
 how to do this because before I recorded 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.380
 only with the grandparents freight and it was 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:45.230
 horrible even I saw the other gameplay 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.320
 of people and the audio was really bad 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.440
 I understand but I think I got it. 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.410
 it was born there in the middle of the same hope 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.300
 my new microphone arrives to be able to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.240
