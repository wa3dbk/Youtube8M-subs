Heather again this is the third video

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.039 
Heather again this is the third video
for<00:00:03.959> hematology<00:00:04.790> will<00:00:05.790> concentrate<00:00:06.089> on<00:00:06.540> base

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
for hematology will concentrate on base

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.379 
for hematology will concentrate on base
a<00:00:07.080> few<00:00:07.350> years<00:00:07.620> some<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.370> new<00:00:09.150> trophy

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
a few years some of you and new trophy

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.249 
a few years some of you and new trophy
is<00:00:09.570> going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> short<00:00:10.230> video<00:00:10.969> first<00:00:12.259> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
is going to be a short video first the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.259 
is going to be a short video first the
base<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.769> views<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.639> know<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> base<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> you

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
base of views you know the base of you

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.620 
base of views you know the base of you
by<00:00:15.420> itself<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.289> useful<00:00:17.300> so<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.359> know

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
by itself is not very useful so you know

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.250 
by itself is not very useful so you know
if<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:19.140> basal<00:00:20.130> filia<00:00:20.490> by<00:00:21.240> self<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.050> thing

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
if you see basal filia by self the thing

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.599 
if you see basal filia by self the thing
I<00:00:22.439> think<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.630> my<00:00:24.630> lap<00:00:24.840> relative

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
I think of is my lap relative

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.839 
I think of is my lap relative
proliferative<00:00:26.609> disorder<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.689> CML

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
proliferative disorder like you know CML

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.690 
proliferative disorder like you know CML
but<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.090> otherwise<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.700> very

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
but you know otherwise it's not very

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
but you know otherwise it's not very
useful<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> does

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
useful but you know one thing it does

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.920 
useful but you know one thing it does
turn<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.309> its<00:00:35.489> mass<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.600> said<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
turn into its mass so like we said it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.430 
turn into its mass so like we said it
for<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> does<00:00:37.680> contain<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> few<00:00:38.489> things<00:00:38.700> like

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
for so it does contain a few things like

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.310 
for so it does contain a few things like
histamine<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.530> also<00:00:41.489> look<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.760> Ryan<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:43.020> far

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
histamine and also look at Ryan as far

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.760 
histamine and also look at Ryan as far
as<00:00:43.410> happened<00:00:43.860> inside<00:00:44.219> those<00:00:44.460> granules<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
as happened inside those granules and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.700 
as happened inside those granules and
when<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> goes<00:00:47.100> inside<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> cell<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> becomes

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
when it goes inside the cell it becomes

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.799 
when it goes inside the cell it becomes
mast<00:00:49.710> cells<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.430> here's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.420> picture<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
mast cells and here's a good picture of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.680 
mast cells and here's a good picture of
that<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:53.360> picture<00:00:54.620> base<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.690> where

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that actually picture base of you where

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
that actually picture base of you where
the<00:00:57.780> arrow<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> pointing<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> middle

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the arrow is pointing to in the middle

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
the arrow is pointing to in the middle
of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> page<00:00:59.600> that's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> base<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:02.539> right

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
of the page that's a base of you right

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.010 
of the page that's a base of you right
off<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> bottom<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> page<00:01:06.750> here

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
off to the bottom of the page here

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.460 
off to the bottom of the page here
that's<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> band<00:01:10.409> cell<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that's a band cell and then that is a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
that's a band cell and then that is a
neutral<00:01:14.280> feel<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> wireframes

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
neutral feel right with the wireframes

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.270 
neutral feel right with the wireframes
so<00:01:17.540> basically<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.280> think

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so basically you know you have to think

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560 
so basically you know you have to think
you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.909> mast<00:01:21.180> cells<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you have to know about a mast cells that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
you have to know about a mast cells that
it<00:01:21.689> contains<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.280> middle<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.580> GE

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it contains it's the middle I GE

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
it contains it's the middle I GE
mediated<00:01:24.830> its<00:01:25.830> ige-mediated<00:01:27.530> degranulation

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
mediated its ige-mediated degranulation

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.929 
mediated its ige-mediated degranulation
processed<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.110> one<00:01:31.110> drug<00:01:31.530> give<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.670> drug

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
processed and one drug give me one drug

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.170 
processed and one drug give me one drug
that<00:01:32.970> could<00:01:33.240> inhibit<00:01:33.720> histamine<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that could inhibit histamine and that is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
that could inhibit histamine and that is
of<00:01:36.329> course<00:01:37.909> cromolyn<00:01:38.909> sodium<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.960> use

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of course cromolyn sodium which we use

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
of course cromolyn sodium which we use
for<00:01:40.229> asthma<00:01:40.950> okay<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> first<00:01:41.939> line<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
for asthma okay not the first line of

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.130 
for asthma okay not the first line of
treatment<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.829> uses<00:01:44.189> adjunct<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
treatment but we uses adjunct to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.190 
treatment but we uses adjunct to
contrast<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.950> patients<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.780> course<00:01:48.810> it's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
contrast my patients and of course it's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.179 
contrast my patients and of course it's
a<00:01:49.350> type<00:01:49.619> 1<00:01:49.860> hypersensitivity<00:01:50.780> reaction<00:01:52.189> used

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction used

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.910 
a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction used
mast<00:01:54.000> cell<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.659> looks<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.350> similar<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
mast cell which looks very similar to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
mast cell which looks very similar to
the<00:01:56.219> base<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the base of you and then here is the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.609 
the base of you and then here is the
eosinophil<00:01:58.950> eos<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.840> looks<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:01.380> much

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
eosinophil eos you know looks very much

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.760 
eosinophil eos you know looks very much
like<00:02:01.649> base<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> could<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.770> some

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
like base of here we could have some

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.370 
like base of here we could have some
like<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> by<00:02:05.490> lope<00:02:05.820> shape<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.229> main

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
like that by lope shape but the main

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
like that by lope shape but the main
thing<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.770> too<00:02:08.310> bad<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:08.849> day<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.060> now

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
thing here too bad the first day is now

eosinophil<00:02:19.890> okay<00:02:20.160> no<00:02:20.370> questions<00:02:20.730> asked<00:02:21.530> with

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
eosinophil okay no questions asked with

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.360 
eosinophil okay no questions asked with
grand<00:02:22.800> news<00:02:22.920> okay<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:24.720> course<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
grand news okay and of course the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.400 
grand news okay and of course the
different<00:02:26.670> types<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.209> condition<00:02:27.959> could<00:02:28.140> get

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
different types of condition could get

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.550 
different types of condition could get
us<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.800> few<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.340> they<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> mnemonic

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
us in a few here they have a mnemonic

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080 
us in a few here they have a mnemonic
NAACP<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.190> me<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.910> think

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
NAACP but you know for me just think

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690 
NAACP but you know for me just think
about<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.480> atopic<00:02:34.260> disorders<00:02:35.220> right<00:02:35.430> topic

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
about the atopic disorders right topic

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.760 
about the atopic disorders right topic
dermatitis<00:02:36.300> asthma<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.050> eczema<00:02:37.170> those<00:02:37.650> are

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
dermatitis asthma and eczema those are

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.100 
dermatitis asthma and eczema those are
the<00:02:37.830> triads<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.520> then<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.209> course<00:02:39.239> allergic

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the triads and then of course allergic

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.339 
the triads and then of course allergic
reactions<00:02:41.390> one<00:02:42.390> allergic<00:02:42.660> reaction<00:02:43.200> that's

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
reactions one allergic reaction that's

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.920 
reactions one allergic reaction that's
useful<00:02:43.590> clinically<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.310> if<00:02:44.550> someone<00:02:44.760> has<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> CT

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
useful clinically is if someone has a CT

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410 
useful clinically is if someone has a CT
scan<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> they<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.550> failure<00:02:48.000> you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
scan and they have we know failure you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
scan and they have we know failure you
know<00:02:48.540> getting<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.530> eosinophils<00:02:49.950> it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
know getting you and eosinophils it's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.090 
know getting you and eosinophils it's
actually<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.230> renal<00:02:52.620> failure<00:02:52.769> work

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
actually one of the renal failure work

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.210 
actually one of the renal failure work
up<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.670> if<00:02:53.850> they<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:55.220> allergic

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
up to see if they have allergic

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.680 
up to see if they have allergic
nephritis<00:02:56.940> from<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> CT<00:02:58.080> scan<00:02:58.350> contrast<00:02:58.830> okay

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
nephritis from the CT scan contrast okay

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.090 
nephritis from the CT scan contrast okay
that's<00:03:00.690> more<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.110> step<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.590> material

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
that's more of like a step to material

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.039 
that's more of like a step to material
but<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.340> helps<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.760> consolidate<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> concept<00:03:03.870> of

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
but it helps to consolidate a concept of

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.710 
but it helps to consolidate a concept of
Eos<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> then<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> course<00:03:05.459> parasites<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.569> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
Eos and then of course parasites is the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.050 
Eos and then of course parasites is the
other<00:03:06.840> big<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> step<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.519> any<00:03:08.760> kind

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
other big one for the step one any kind

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.630 
other big one for the step one any kind
of<00:03:09.120> warms<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> put<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> zones<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:13.640> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
of warms and put a zones here like you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.170 
of warms and put a zones here like you
know<00:03:15.890> trichomonas<00:03:16.890> stuff<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.430> also

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
know trichomonas stuff like that also

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.030 
know trichomonas stuff like that also
could<00:03:18.630> give<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.440> elevated<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.530> then<00:03:22.859> let's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
could give you elevated and then let's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
could give you elevated and then let's
move<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.850> neutral<00:03:24.540> fuels<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.109> we'll

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
move on to a neutral fuels here we'll

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.170 
move on to a neutral fuels here we'll
talk<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:25.890> about<00:03:25.980> those<00:03:26.220> specific<00:03:26.850> condition

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
talk more about those specific condition

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
talk more about those specific condition
wherein<00:03:27.299> get<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.600> their<00:03:27.720> systems<00:03:28.079> just

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
wherein get to their systems just

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.430 
wherein get to their systems just
brought<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.370> your<00:03:29.609> overview<00:03:30.209> right<00:03:30.570> now<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
brought of your overview right now the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.229 
brought of your overview right now the
Nutri<00:03:31.739> fuse<00:03:31.980> usual<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:32.730> three<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.030> five

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
Nutri fuse usual have three to five

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.870 
Nutri fuse usual have three to five
Lopes<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:34.769> know<00:03:34.859> if<00:03:34.980> have<00:03:35.130> illallah<00:03:35.609> lobes

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
Lopes you know if have illallah lobes

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.060 
Lopes you know if have illallah lobes
and<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.180> call<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> hyper<00:03:37.290> segmented<00:03:37.890> Newt

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
and we call it hyper segmented Newt

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.840 
and we call it hyper segmented Newt
refuse<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.480> then<00:03:39.630> b12<00:03:40.200> deficiency<00:03:40.890> okay

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
refuse you see then b12 deficiency okay

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.390 
refuse you see then b12 deficiency okay
and<00:03:42.090> basically<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:43.650> know<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.859> nutria<00:03:44.160> fuse

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
and basically you know the nutria fuse

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.840 
and basically you know the nutria fuse
or<00:03:45.470> these<00:03:46.470> cells<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.100> qualify<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> be<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
or these cells and to qualify to be a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.280 
or these cells and to qualify to be a
neutral<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.329> instead<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.810> band<00:03:49.019> cell

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
neutral for you instead of a band cell

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.289 
neutral for you instead of a band cell
or<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> metal<00:03:49.769> mallow<00:03:50.130> sites<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.150> see

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
or a metal mallow sites you have to see

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.330 
or a metal mallow sites you have to see
those<00:03:51.450> wires<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.320> here<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.799> do<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.190> those

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
those wires and here you do see those

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.520 
those wires and here you do see those
wife<00:03:53.579> does<00:03:54.510> wire<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> right<00:03:55.140> between<00:03:55.290> those

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
wife does wire is right between those

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.539 
wife does wire is right between those
slopes<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:57.000> that's<00:03:57.239> what<00:03:57.510> identifies<00:03:57.780> as<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
slopes so that's what identifies as a

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.460 
slopes so that's what identifies as a
neutral<00:03:59.549> field<00:03:59.790> basically<00:04:00.420> neutral<00:04:01.049> view<00:04:01.260> is

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
neutral field basically neutral view is

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069 
neutral field basically neutral view is
once<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.310> see<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.970> it's<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
once you see that you know it's a

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.259 
once you see that you know it's a
bacterial<00:04:04.560> infection<00:04:05.030> until<00:04:06.030> proven

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
bacterial infection until proven

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.490 
bacterial infection until proven
otherwise<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:08.750> that's<00:04:09.750> basically<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.319> for

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
otherwise and that's basically it for

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.870 
otherwise and that's basically it for
those<00:04:10.950> three<00:04:11.220> cells<00:04:11.489> and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
those three cells and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.100 
those three cells and
we'll<00:04:14.880> talk<00:04:15.030> about<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.270> monocyte<00:04:15.660> macrophage

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
we'll talk about a monocyte macrophage

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.930 
we'll talk about a monocyte macrophage
and<00:04:16.350> dendritic<00:04:16.620> cells<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.220> next<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
and dendritic cells in the next in the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.270 
and dendritic cells in the next in the
next<00:04:18.150> video
