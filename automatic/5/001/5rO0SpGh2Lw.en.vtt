triples<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.250> week<00:02:17.780> low<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:18.930> heavier<00:02:19.230> weight

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
triples this week low but heavier weight

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250 
triples this week low but heavier weight
than<00:02:19.800> last<00:02:20.220> week<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:20.850> for<00:02:21.570> specifics

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
than last week I think for specifics

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.280 
than last week I think for specifics
it's<00:02:22.500> most<00:02:22.770> likely<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:24.050> 6570<00:02:25.050> percent

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
it's most likely in the 6570 percent

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.740 
it's most likely in the 6570 percent
range<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.850> hidden<00:02:29.850> some<00:02:30.030> speed<00:02:30.300> triples

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
range so hidden some speed triples

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750 
range so hidden some speed triples

this<00:03:08.940> bar<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.680> bouncing<00:03:10.680> I've<00:03:10.800> gotten<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> lot

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
this bar is bouncing I've gotten a lot

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.070 
this bar is bouncing I've gotten a lot
of<00:03:11.310> gears<00:03:11.520> out<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.660> seems<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.989> be

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
of gears out of it and it seems to be

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.990 
of gears out of it and it seems to be
fine<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.040> things<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.580> it's

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
fine for a lot of things but it's it's

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.790 
fine for a lot of things but it's it's
pretty<00:03:15.360> whippy<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.220> point<00:03:18.590> not<00:03:19.590> that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
pretty whippy and at this point not that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.680 
pretty whippy and at this point not that
it<00:03:19.920> ever<00:03:20.160> had<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> time<00:03:20.880> when<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.180> wasn't<00:03:21.390> it

just<00:03:21.840> may<00:03:22.080> not<00:03:22.110> be<00:03:22.290> designed<00:03:22.770> for<00:03:22.980> exactly

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
just may not be designed for exactly

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.220 
just may not be designed for exactly
what<00:03:23.520> I'm<00:03:23.610> using<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.420> Texas<00:03:24.780> squat<00:03:25.080> bar

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
what I'm using it for so Texas squat bar

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.110 
what I'm using it for so Texas squat bar
would<00:03:25.380> be<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> lot<00:03:25.709> stiffer<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.370> think<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
would be a lot stiffer I think that's a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.820 
would be a lot stiffer I think that's a
big<00:03:27.270> reason<00:03:27.450> why<00:03:27.660> when<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> was<00:03:28.170> at<00:03:28.290> Marc's<00:03:28.590> I

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
big reason why when I was at Marc's I

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.530 
big reason why when I was at Marc's I
was<00:03:29.250> able<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.520> hit<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:31.130> 505<00:03:32.130> 410<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.420> my
