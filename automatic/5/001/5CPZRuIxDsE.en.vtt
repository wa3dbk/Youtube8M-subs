had this ever since you know summer 2009
and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.719> haven't<00:00:55.050> hit<00:00:55.170> pan<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and I thought haven't hit pan on it and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.479 
and I thought haven't hit pan on it and
I<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:56.730> single<00:00:57.149> day<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> swear<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
I use is every single day I swear and

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
I use is every single day I swear and
this<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.699> even<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> full<00:01:00.239> size<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this is not even the full size so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
this is not even the full size so
imagine<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> full<00:01:02.010> size<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
imagine if I got the full size and it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450 
imagine if I got the full size and it
probably<00:01:03.030> took<00:01:03.210> me<00:01:03.359> years<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.140> finish<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.769> but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
probably took me years to finish it but

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.090

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
i'm planning to hit pan on this soon so
that<00:01:08.159> i<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.850> finish<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.570> i<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.900> get

this for a while so this is what it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.109 
this for a while so this is what it
looks<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.040> basically<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.759> powder

quad<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> same<00:01:53.009> concept<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
quad and it's the same concept as you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.560 
quad and it's the same concept as you
know<00:01:54.270> those<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:55.549> color<00:01:56.549> concealers<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.450> it's
