00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.790
 Hello everyone and how are you? 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.070
 I hope it's great and in the video 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.560
 today as you see I bring you something that 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.340
 you have asked a lot about it and it is 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.670
 how blonde gets like getting blond 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.640
 how it wrinkles and new line I try like this 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.160
 that if you want to know my experience and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.100
 as I have done to have this color 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.310
 you can stay to know it good first of 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.609
 everything I will tell the story of the hair 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.520
 how it has evolved more or less I 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:38.180
 when there was not a little ball 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.810
 I had black hair black 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.360
 yes yes I can leave photos here worth 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.230
 Then when I was growing up, it was 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.180
 clarifying and had a brown tone and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.870
 then I was clarifying a little more 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 even I think that fourteen fifteen 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.480
 years that I already had a tone I thought that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.710
 It was a light brown but there are people who 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.960
 called me blonde so well this was 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.479
 the color basically and good after 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.690
 this this initiation to my hair color 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.840
 I am going to tell you how and why 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.280
 I wanted to dye myself as a blonde for the truth 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.090
 that I 've always wanted to be blonde 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.700
 whenever I leave my dreams and then it arrived 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.830
 at 16 I think it was and I decided 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.049
 come to me blonde basically so I 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.700
 I was informing since as I say I do not 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.369
 I'm no professional I'm just going 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.100
 to tell an experience so I 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.909
 was informing and such had like two 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.830
 possibilities 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.259
 otermÃ­n I hear blond or make me 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.940
 wicks everything everyone told me that 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.789
 It was better to make me wicks because you could see 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.119
 more natural but the concept that I had 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.399
 I of wicks was like an example that I'm going 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.850
 to put here in a plan that was noticeable 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.039
 the difference between black and girls and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.130
 blond so I did not like anything 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.700
 so what I did was go on a mercadona 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.060
 and I bought I think a blond dye from 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.220
 garnier I think it was if I do not remember and what 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.550
 what I did good was if the instructions 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.640
 I put there and it stayed 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.680
 I have pictures of that as an orange tone 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.069
 and well that was a bit of a disaster 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.890
 why 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.599
 I bought a boat and I had more hair 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.790
 or less as I have it now long 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.480
 I think or just a little bit more and I have 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.760
 quite a lot I do not know if you can see that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.549
 I have half my hair only 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.470
 well I have enough quantity and the boat 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.930
 Well, it 's not like he wants me for everything 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.400
 that will be all invented 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.890
 I bought another boat because it had 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.360
 I left my orange as I said 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.740
 and I threw it back and I do not know anything 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.730
 there was a little bit more 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.300
 the clearest farm 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.640
 there was a lot of difference so 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.400
 I finally decided to go to the hairdresser and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.340
 saw that did not have much basis that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.159
 so they gave me a little more 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.650
 they magnified me so that we will have 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:18.940
 so orange and good like that was a while 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.760
 until at 3 months he started me 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.910
 come out root so I decided to do the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.390
 Wicks and well I have an acquaintance that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.790
 did a hairdressing course and I was 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.030
 and the wick was doing so more or 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.769
 less one year I did have some 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.370
 most important event and that was going to the 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.560
 tip 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.019
 to the hairdresser to have it mati 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.890
 will ficarÃ¡ and cut it tilt me â€‹â€‹and others 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.980
 school during this time as I say 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.750
 what I was doing to keep myself 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.120
 a blond that did not turn into an organ 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.799
 is to use this shampoo here that is 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.980
 of the market is now worth of different 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.260
 brands and more professional is worth but 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.460
 this one is very well the truth and is worth two 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.850
 euros is a shampoo for 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.420
 white hair are mixed platinums that 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.450
 What she does is that her hair is not visible 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.910
 so yellow chicken for example and that 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.220
 it is a more natural blond to tell you that 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.830
 is all this time what is 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.940
 doing that has been until there is a 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:26.180
 point that I want that was worth the last 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.030
 Once I got the wicks, it was in May 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.950
 of 2014 or it's easy almost a year since 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.160
 I do not do the wicks and it's because 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.760
 Summer is quite clear to me then 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.990
 you could see so much the root and what I've 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.070
 been doing now in winter is 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.970
 throw me chamomile in the root have the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.450
 Camomile me in my place I used and I 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.130
 It goes well like there is a good reflection 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.310
 orange because this what it does is 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.280
 work your tone naturally like there 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.380
 some orange reflection but as I say 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.110
 who put the shampoo because it does not show much 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.410
 so if you have black hair 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.930
 example there are already wicks do not use this 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.850
 because it's not going to do us any good 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.940
 example, what I'm doing and 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.780
 now it 's throwing me the chamomile and what 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.570
 I do it's the first day that I clean the 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.400
 let's say I have not done this because this 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.650
 she is a pretty partner, the truth 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.950
 then the next day yes I did the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.530
 I made and I go out and said that 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.930
 give him the sun and the next day since 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.640
 when I 'm going to wash it, I also do what 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.370
 same and then at night I washed it 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.340
 and the truth is that I'm almost a year 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.430
 doing this and it gives me quite well and I 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.490
 you will ask and why have not you done 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.910
 the wicks in baby cast chamomile 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.160
 because I'm not sure what with my hair 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.820
 I still do not know if it will come back to me 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.830
 hair from before I left it blond so 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.840
 for now I'm throwing chamomile for 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.260
 understand it still a little bit clearer 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.620
 but not about how to keep hair 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.600
 Blonde hair is quite difficult because it 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.740
 mistreats after me pretty 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.569
 the wicks like that 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.460
 and I got a handful of white hair that 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.190
 I fell a lot but esque 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.710
 if your hair is broken because they are 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.620
 mistreating a lot so what do I do 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.720
 is when the hairdresser obviously 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.770
 I cut it but when I'm home I 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.229
 short every two or three months because you get 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.300
 the tips are immediately horrible and 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.330
 more and you put it between laughs and the 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.400
 regarding care as I tell you 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.750
 lila shampoo as I tell you that I use it 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.139
 once a week 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.599
 I also use the usual shampoo in my 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.699
 mask and it's also once to the 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.410
 week this mask here that I 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.800
 sent from Brazil and beauty and makes 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.570
 time and it's a kilo of mask and what 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.660
 what he does is like he has to grill 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.340
 and I kind of stuff your hair and 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.169
 good up here the video gone 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.479
 answering more or less to the questions 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.759
 that you have done to me some that you have 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:19.340
 been some that has asked me the most 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.740
 about my hair to be for example or 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.009
 even down the street I have been paid for 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.490
 ask me about my hair 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:29.190
 well I do not know 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.050
 to good and I do not know if you will notice much the cut 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.789
 but it's around here pretty much 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.159
 The wick of me here is throwing me 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:38.759
 like my side so you can see a little 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.759
 Of diference 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.919
 and nothing if you have any further questions leave me 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.110
 the in the comments that I the 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.990
 you will answer and if there are many area 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.850
 another video but nothing I hope that I have 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.479
 served and see you next video 

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.479
 goodbye 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.050
 Y
