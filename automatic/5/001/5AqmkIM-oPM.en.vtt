00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.350
 so we have an audi a 4 2 here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.870
 liter tdi type 8 k and indeed rooms 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 exchange generator freewheel effect us 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.260
 now have to screw the four first 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.760
 I've already done that and solved it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 Although the cover is then simply off 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.470
 made and then the headlights 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.300
 have to be for the headlights 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.529
 just four screws solved once 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.730
 we have here that is simply solved 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 not completely dismantled 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.290
 that must be completely off and behind here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.149
 we have two more screws 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.559
 you can watch it once down there the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 must be solved and the other 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.129
 this is sitting behind here 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:58.440
 which must be dissolved but only 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:00.600
 solved so not completely out can 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 to write the one who has been before 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.320
 just pull out 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320
 Very easy to handle okay 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:43.190
 sits behind with screwdriver pieces 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.860
 You can turn the headlight forward 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.860
 already take off 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.140
 We have to do this around the bumper 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.490
 dismount 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.490
 make the two screws out of it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 then there is still a tenth behind it 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.530
 screw what the bumper still 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 additionally holds 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.390
 and here, the second check is the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.390
 we can also from the inside 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.600
 once and the same we have on the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.600
 left side 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:45.550
 now the bumper would have to be 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:48.130
 be free so have the proud ones now 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:04:06.819

00:03:48.130 --> 00:04:13.980

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:36.539
 that is all free and can now completely 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:42.180
 Carefully pull in the plug 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.180
 Disassemble fog lights 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.830
 dollar or complete unit 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.740
 we have to move forward here 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.740

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.310
