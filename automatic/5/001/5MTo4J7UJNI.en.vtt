00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 Big games are Enke Red Devils with Crazy Albert just released 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.610
 Resident Evil 5 will soon be coming out in the next few days, as well as Konami 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 want to shudder us and with Silent Hill Holm comment 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.460
 By the way, the first game of the series for an index Jan console 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.929
 Ten years ago, Konami put on the first PlayStation with Silent Hill one 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:32.879
 milestone 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.539
 There it was proven that you can really scare yourself in front of the console 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.340
 "We are now leaving everything running for example on the PSP outside and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.199
 focus on the new 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.359
 fifth part of the big series there would first be the protagonist in the skin 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.719
 protected value Alex Scherbarth has a war veteran at the beginning of the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.079
 Game in hospital wakes up and obviously with a war trauma too 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.839
 Fighting has delusions witnessing his psychosis 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.640
 but when the division has that his little brother George is in danger 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580
 breaks open 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.100
 70 in his hometown 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 Sherpas stay 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.950
 Voigtsberger 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.210
 Bronze got 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.180
 there it becomes clear the visions were right Alex brother 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.320
 has disappeared 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.440
 his mother is mentally disturbed and over the whole city lid 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.770
 more mysterious were running 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.229
 this year's adventure begins again 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.969
 But she would not be able to do so later in the new eponymous street 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.980
 History of the story 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.619
 so then closes then the latest part of the series 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.720
 big and small 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.180
 the old episodes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.240
 on the trail of the secrets of the story 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.399
 so goodbye 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.440
 and honestly, of course, again against numerous dealers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 which sometimes can not be more appetizing 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.379
 So far, everything sounds familiar and yet a lot has changed 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.689
 The reason for the change is first and foremost the developer of the game 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.400
 Sallenthin was not first developed in Japan this time was the developer 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.259
 because Poldi Leaks from the US responsible for the game content 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.080
 and this new handwriting is noticeable to the game at every corner 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.730
 assuming you know the predecessors everything is a little less subtle 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.109
 easier and a little less big 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.079
 although the old charm remains due to the new gameplay elements 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.099
 however, this Silence savagery feels a little different 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.069
 responsible for this are primarily the fights the new controller 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.810
 Ensures that the fighting comes much more directly from the hand 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.620
 even the combat training of war veterans Kalex the so 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.400
 Connected tension is lost in the battle machine Erl ex-leader 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.269
 Still problematic is that the other elements in the game are no longer 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.959
 the same oppressive atmosphere that creates the events 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.249
 has distinguished 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.239
 the shock effects to the unfortunately too rare and interesting in-depth 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.559
 Dolly turn off too 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.929
 but enough for the negative words whose number 5 is still in the heart 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:24.480
 pay Tel and make purely playful nothing really wrong Weinmann 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.159
 Nevertheless, Bolt said 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.729
 Dortmund 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.879
 okay get restaurant is really upset 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.799
 to become a man 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.459
 Give Toshiba 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.669
 visually the trip is appealing due to the big wave 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.989
 Content makes a good impression and also plays home acoustically 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.579
 Gaming its trumps 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.769
 Back on board is Akira Yamaoka who already plays the music for the old tracks 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:52.620
 composed 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 Again, the well-known piano and industrial cranes provide density 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.859
 the atmosphere 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.349
 a seemingly big game world without much breathing space and a new one 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.339
 automatic overview card Do well the game flow and Dean Gruselfans in 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.929
 the spell 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.769
 even this clearly from the not want to reveal much goes fine 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.029
 and unfolds completely line 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.259
 Captain for chapter there about ten hours it at least on the normal 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.409
 Castle difficulty then you get one of five different ends 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.150
 to see the adventure 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.410
 some action in the game affect this outcome 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.820
 a second or third play through makes sense so coacht 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 It's bad 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.680
 when 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 what would a coach like 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.860
 the send 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.099
 7 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.099
 7 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.389
 in the 4th 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.669
 yes the water only merchants in seven days, of course, the next shipment 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:10.419
 and then 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.699
 Look a bit more intense on Tom Clancy's HAWX
