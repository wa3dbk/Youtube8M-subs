00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.190
 will concern the under pearls 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.940
 it's a trick I discovered on 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:30.180
 internet that has been posted on youtube 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.870
 by English and I wanted 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 transcribe in French in order to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.750
 want to share 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.250
 well, let's start 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.810
 so how is this trick 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 as you know them questions when 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.620
 you throw them there at a time when he 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 nothing happens until one of the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.140
 hangouts the poses it's I think that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.059
 you understood 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 so we will use this moment for 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.860
 get into this were killed you go 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.579
 quickly understand then we will bother them 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.549
 his desires know that it is necessary that the 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:24.899
 trick works and heard oops I 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:30.359
 I'm going to kill a zombie 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:33.889
 who is here you start the interval 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.240
 just above you like that hop 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:38.609
 when you re spawn and you will come to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.099
 your spawn place and hop all of a 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.670
 blow you are teleporting where you 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.709
 were killed because you launched one of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 landmarks the right above you like 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.319

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.869
