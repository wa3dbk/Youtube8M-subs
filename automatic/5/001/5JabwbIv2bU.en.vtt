00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.960 

wow<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:23.109> was<00:00:23.259> pretty<00:00:23.470> loud<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.519> don't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
put some that super lube on it

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.850 
put some that super lube on it
okay<00:01:43.820> now<00:01:44.330> we're<00:01:44.540> gonna<00:01:44.630> see<00:01:44.960> what<00:01:45.200> happens<00:01:45.229> I

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
okay now we're gonna see what happens I

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.280 
okay now we're gonna see what happens I
think<00:01:46.400> it's<00:01:46.670> got<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.150> one<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.080> back

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
think it's got to do it one up and back

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.020 
think it's got to do it one up and back
to<00:01:48.470> get<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.710> trolley<00:01:49.009> on<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:49.430> hang<00:01:49.640> on<00:01:52.030> caught

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
to get that trolley on so hang on caught

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.700 
to get that trolley on so hang on caught
it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:05.430 
it
okay<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.430> does<00:01:55.610> sound<00:01:55.850> quieter

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520 

you<00:02:05.920> know<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.340> quieter<00:02:07.290> maybe<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:08.380> should

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
you know that is quieter maybe I should

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.930 
you know that is quieter maybe I should
do<00:02:08.650> this<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:08.979> every<00:02:09.250> three<00:02:09.520> months<00:02:09.729> or

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
do this like every three months or

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.800 
do this like every three months or
something

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:39.180 

yeah<00:02:18.350> Carter

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280 

it<00:02:39.460> seems<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.910> yeah<00:02:40.390> instead<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.900> once<00:02:41.170> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it seems like yeah instead of once a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.720 
it seems like yeah instead of once a
year<00:02:41.500> doing<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.070> seems<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.460> maybe<00:02:42.610> I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
year doing this it seems like maybe I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.790 
year doing this it seems like maybe I
should<00:02:42.880> do<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.000> every<00:02:43.030> six<00:02:43.420> months<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.740> know

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
should do it every six months you know

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.300 
should do it every six months you know
maybe<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.160> would<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.340> better<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.100> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
maybe that would be better so so that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.510 
maybe that would be better so so that
does<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.820> doesn't<00:02:49.180> prove<00:02:49.330> it
