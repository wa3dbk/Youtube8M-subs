00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.720
 how to make your makeup simple but 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.410
 with a lot of easy power a delineated 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.960
 two colors white and black sounds 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.410
 simple but at the moment of truth you see 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 super cool and shows attitude in your 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 look let's start 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.280
 no matter how produced or so 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.530
 Simple you want to see with your look but 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.320
 always important to have a good face 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.080
 makeup for that use the base cover 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 mad in my confidential this time and 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.239
 we are simply going to apply it throughout the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 face to cover the imperfections and 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.640
 What I love about this base is that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 it covers very well but it's a base 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.290
 light that does not leave your face as well as 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.690
 super charged with one centimeter of base 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.680
 but it leaves you super nice but 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.560
 taking with the base in control in beige 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.300
 control simply corrects those places 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.850
 that need a little more than 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.670
 correction as the dark circles the redness to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.670
 the sides of the nose the spots or 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.080
 granites that we want to cover very well 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 now with checkmate in mid confidential 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.539
 simply with a brush seal those 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.570
 bases so your makeup does not run 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.119
 to also remove the extra brightness that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.550
 we do not like it and the makeup lasts a lot 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.450
 more time also applies a little about 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.200
 the eyelids now with the duo mix let's go 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.720
 to do this delineated double in black 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.490
 mix white this effect because blank and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 just black the colors that we need 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 we started making a line of cats 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.630
 with the white color so let's go 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.090
 slowly reviewing the white color 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.620
 until we left as we want without 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.270
 hurt us 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.860
 the pencil cited as you go 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 going through your eyelid is going to go 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.980
 warming up so he's going to do the same 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.920
 sliding skin temperature 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.650
 easier and that piquin mind well so 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.030
 that a lot of patience and make a line of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.030
 white cat 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.050
 of course he repeats the same thing in the other 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.510
 eye and remember to make it a little wider 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.000
 of what I would generally do in a 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.970
 line of cats because over then you 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 let's put a black line so it's 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.050
 they have to see the two colors that's why 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.660
 is a little bit chubbier now for 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.080
 seal the color white with color 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.190
 intense in white russian you are going to apply 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.870
 with a thin brush a bit of this 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.530
 pigment to make it look more powerful the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.720
 white color also without the pencil below 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.750
 you're going to put some of this pigment 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.450
 under the lower tabs for 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.630
 light up the eyes and now with the line 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.880
 for ever in black for ever simply 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.069
 you're going to make a cat line a little bit 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.019
 more thin as half of this 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.120
 what you just did with the white to 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.030
 That 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.299
 create there the double delineated white and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.299
 black 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.830
 fills that black line very well for 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.110
 that also looks super well defined to 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.990
 I like to use this brush tip 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.670
 because it makes my job easier but yes 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.920
 you want you can use it in the other 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.370
 presentation now with the eyeliner 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.650
 wo mix but in black this time we're going to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.830
 delineate the water line so that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.190
 also make the contrast with the line 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.709
 cites a white angle and is 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.280
 under the lower lashes 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.950
 now with the curl and excell in curling the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.190
 let's comb and make up our 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.290
 eyelashes to give the final touch to 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.290
 this eye makeup simply 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.220
 a couple of capes we combed very well and 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.940
 remember that this mask what it does is 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 larger eyelashes super curves and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.650
 expressive as we love 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.919
 do not forget to apply also a couple of 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.370
 capita in the lower lashes now 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.310
 with the chic girl flush in pink and dale 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.680
 a little color to your cheeks this 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.290
 blush I like very much that it is very 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.440
 well to the skins like mine like half 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.180
 Brunette so it's like orange with 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 The consequences 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.660
 What is a transparent gel mask 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.720
 we are simply going to comb the eyebrows to 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.910
 Give it a beautiful shape without recharging 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.120
 too much and ready 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.100
 now with the beauty lips in berlin let's go 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.340
 to make up our lips this is a 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.979
 super nice color so I do not expect a 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.990
 little bit more pink is super cute with 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.350
 this makeup but if you prefer 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.449
 you can also add one more color 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.550
 but as I want it to stand out 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.680
 the makeup of the eyes the double 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.440
 delineated black and white I chose this 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.930
 color a bit calmer now with the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.410
 irvi de lips en ourense let's give it 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.990
 Extra shine to this lip color 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.360
 love it more than google is delicious 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.650
 provocateur only has a few flashes 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.810
 divine that make your mouth look more 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.110
 provocative and this is the end result 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.870
 girls a double delineated does not cost us 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.060
 Too much time to do it with a little 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.240
 patience you can achieve these two lines 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.130
 Super cute 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.490
 striking that you will see super well and 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.020
 It works for all occasions I hope 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.670
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.670
