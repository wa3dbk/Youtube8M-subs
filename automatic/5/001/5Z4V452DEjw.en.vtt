scooters that the 50 cc scooters just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.719

all
if<00:01:54.649> I<00:01:54.709> just<00:01:54.890> pop<00:01:55.069> it<00:01:55.190> onto<00:01:55.310> its<00:01:55.550> main<00:01:55.819> stand<00:01:56.289> you

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
if I just pop it onto its main stand you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.570 
if I just pop it onto its main stand you
can<00:01:57.440> just<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.709> a<00:01:57.740> closer<00:01:58.069> look<00:01:58.280> at<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
can just have a closer look at the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.550 
can just have a closer look at the
actual<00:01:58.700> breaks<00:01:59.209> on<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.479> because<00:01:59.810> they're

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
actual breaks on it because they're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.499 
actual breaks on it because they're
definitely<00:02:00.770> worth<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.340> mention<00:02:01.520> at<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.270> front

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
definitely worth a mention at the front

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.969 
definitely worth a mention at the front
here<00:02:02.660> you'll<00:02:02.929> see<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.259> two<00:02:03.530> holes<00:02:03.800> is

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
here you'll see this two holes is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.800 
here you'll see this two holes is
they're<00:02:04.190> going<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.729> caliper<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
they're going to this caliper for the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.300 
they're going to this caliper for the
front<00:02:06.020> disc<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.349> it's<00:02:06.500> disc<00:02:06.740> brakes<00:02:06.979> front

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
front disc and it's disc brakes front

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.609 
front disc and it's disc brakes front
and<00:02:07.610> rear<00:02:07.880> on<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.349> reason

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and rear on this one and the reason

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.890 
and rear on this one and the reason
there's<00:02:09.770> two<00:02:09.950> hoses<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.640> because<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.690> got<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
there's two hoses is because it's got a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.870 
there's two hoses is because it's got a
linked<00:02:12.260> brake<00:02:12.560> system<00:02:13.040> which<00:02:13.370> means<00:02:13.610> when<00:02:13.790> you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
linked brake system which means when you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.630 
linked brake system which means when you
pull<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.660> left-hand<00:02:15.340> lever<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
pull this left-hand lever on the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.190 
pull this left-hand lever on the
handlebar<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.420> breaks<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:17.990> as

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
handlebar so it breaks the back as

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320 
handlebar so it breaks the back as
normal<00:02:18.319> brick<00:02:18.709> also<00:02:18.920> breaks<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.550> front<00:02:19.760> so

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
normal brick also breaks the front so

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
normal brick also breaks the front so
that<00:02:20.480> breaks<00:02:20.630> back<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.200> front<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.250> one

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
that breaks back and front and this one

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.339 
that breaks back and front and this one
over<00:02:22.520> here<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.760> breaks<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.390> front<00:02:23.599> linked

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
over here just breaks the front linked

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.559 
over here just breaks the front linked
brakes<00:02:24.709> very<00:02:25.099> very<00:02:25.310> clever<00:02:25.520> as<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.360> say<00:02:26.510> you

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
brakes very very clever as I say you

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.150 
brakes very very clever as I say you
can't<00:02:26.810> see<00:02:27.050> anything<00:02:27.260> mechanically<00:02:27.860> on<00:02:27.950> this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
can't see anything mechanically on this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.120 
can't see anything mechanically on this
but<00:02:28.370> under<00:02:29.000> there<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.690> engine<00:02:29.840> 400<00:02:30.709> CCS

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
but under there is the engine 400 CCS

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.490 
but under there is the engine 400 CCS
single<00:02:31.640> cylinder<00:02:31.910> water-cooled<00:02:32.660> engine<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
single cylinder water-cooled engine and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.949 
single cylinder water-cooled engine and
that's<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.069> lies<00:02:34.250> flat<00:02:34.670> sort<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.510> along<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
that's the lies flat sort of along the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.540 
that's the lies flat sort of along the
chassis<00:02:36.349> really<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> cylinder<00:02:37.069> goes<00:02:37.220> that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
chassis really the cylinder goes that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.520 
chassis really the cylinder goes that
way<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.690> would<00:02:38.810> set<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.050> bodywork<00:02:39.349> off

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
way if I would set the bodywork off

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.690 
way if I would set the bodywork off
you'd<00:02:39.680> see<00:02:39.830> what<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.010> was<00:02:40.130> talking<00:02:40.190> about<00:02:40.459> when

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
you'd see what I was talking about when

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.320 
you'd see what I was talking about when
it<00:02:40.790> goes<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.090> way

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
it goes that way

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.000 
it goes that way
it<00:02:41.810> means<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> Pistons<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:42.890> down

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it means the Pistons going up and down

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.880 
it means the Pistons going up and down
along<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> length<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.420> bike<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.620> helps

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
along the length of the bike that helps

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.140 
along the length of the bike that helps
to<00:02:45.950> keep<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.250> weight<00:02:46.370> down<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.970> also

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
to keep the weight down and it also

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.820 
to keep the weight down and it also
means<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.660> you've<00:02:47.870> got<00:02:47.900> more<00:02:48.230> space<00:02:48.500> under

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
means that you've got more space under

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.780 
means that you've got more space under
your<00:02:48.950> seat<00:02:49.130> because<00:02:49.310> you've<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:49.550> got<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
your seat because you've not got a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.850 
your seat because you've not got a
cylinder<00:02:50.030> stuck<00:02:50.630> up<00:02:50.780> there<00:02:50.989> taking<00:02:51.650> all<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
cylinder stuck up there taking all the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
room up and under the seat is actually

room up and under the seat is actually
quite<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> bit<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.770> room<00:02:54.890> arms<00:02:55.849> up<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.239> way

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
quite a bit of room arms up that way

screen<00:04:37.940> not<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.030> biggest<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.479> screens<00:04:39.750> I've

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
screen not the biggest of screens I've

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.210 
screen not the biggest of screens I've
ever<00:04:39.990> seen<00:04:40.199> but<00:04:40.409> it<00:04:40.560> does<00:04:40.740> actually<00:04:40.919> do<00:04:41.190> a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
ever seen but it does actually do a

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.040 
ever seen but it does actually do a
reasonable<00:04:41.789> job<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.120> keeps<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.479> worst<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
reasonable job it keeps the worst of the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.899 
reasonable job it keeps the worst of the
wind<00:04:43.199> blast<00:04:43.440> off<00:04:43.620> your<00:04:43.770> chest<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.490> your

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
wind blast off your chest and you your

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.029 
wind blast off your chest and you your
neck<00:04:45.090> area<00:04:45.479> so<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.139> quite<00:04:46.620> useful<00:04:46.860> and

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
neck area so it's quite useful and

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.200 
neck area so it's quite useful and
that's<00:04:47.130> quite<00:04:47.430> important<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:47.909> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
that's quite important because this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.149 
that's quite important because this
remember<00:04:48.690> might<00:04:49.229> want<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.470> be<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.560> scooter<00:04:49.979> but

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
remember might want to be a scooter but

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.550 
remember might want to be a scooter but
it's<00:04:50.370> 400<00:04:50.970> CCS<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.659> it's<00:04:52.110> capable<00:04:52.289> of

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's 400 CCS and it's capable of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040 
it's 400 CCS and it's capable of

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
day long and that may sound amazing but

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.200 
day long and that may sound amazing but
it's<00:05:00.090> true<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:01.169> top<00:05:01.409> speed<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:01.770> quoted<00:05:02.280> as<00:05:02.370> 90

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
it's true the top speed is quoted as 90

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.150 
it's true the top speed is quoted as 90
miles<00:05:03.449> an<00:05:03.569> hour<00:05:03.690> but<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> have<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.860> say<00:05:05.009> that

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
miles an hour but I have to say that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.980 
miles an hour but I have to say that
anything<00:05:05.550> above<00:05:05.669> 80<00:05:05.970> should<00:05:06.479> really<00:05:06.870> be

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
anything above 80 should really be

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.870 
anything above 80 should really be
reserved<00:05:07.350> for<00:05:07.470> only<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.039> very<00:05:08.250> straightest

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
reserved for only the very straightest

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.300 
reserved for only the very straightest
of<00:05:09.000> roads<00:05:09.300> because<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.319> Birdman<00:05:10.800> does<00:05:11.100> have<00:05:11.280> a

of roads because the Birdman does have a

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
speed when things get a little twisty I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.439 
speed when things get a little twisty I
think<00:05:16.530> due<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.889> combination<00:05:17.190> of<00:05:17.550> 13-inch

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
think due to a combination of 13-inch

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.499 
think due to a combination of 13-inch
wheels<00:05:18.509> and<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.289> very<00:05:19.560> long<00:05:19.740> wheelbase<00:05:20.419> but<00:05:21.419> of

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
wheels and a very long wheelbase but of

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.270 
wheels and a very long wheelbase but of
course<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.990> shouldn't<00:05:22.380> be<00:05:22.470> doing<00:05:22.590> those<00:05:22.889> kind

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
course you shouldn't be doing those kind

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.120 
course you shouldn't be doing those kind
of<00:05:23.370> speeds<00:05:23.729> that<00:05:24.030> said<00:05:24.960> it's<00:05:25.199> very<00:05:25.500> difficult

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
of speeds that said it's very difficult

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.820 
of speeds that said it's very difficult

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
to find fault with this machine

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.320 
to find fault with this machine
perhaps<00:05:28.830> it's<00:05:29.039> big<00:05:29.340> problem<00:05:29.819> lies<00:05:30.030> with<00:05:30.300> its

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
perhaps it's big problem lies with its

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.559 
perhaps it's big problem lies with its
image<00:05:30.660> or<00:05:31.229> lack<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:32.069> it's<00:05:32.849> often<00:05:33.150> seen<00:05:33.330> as

scooter but more and more bikers are

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.589 
scooter but more and more bikers are
waking<00:05:38.400> up<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.910> idea<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.300> these

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
waking up to the idea that these

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.719 
waking up to the idea that these
machines<00:05:39.870> are<00:05:40.380> more<00:05:40.620> than<00:05:40.770> capable<00:05:41.009> of<00:05:41.310> doing

machines are more than capable of doing

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:42.290 
machines are more than capable of doing
the<00:05:41.820> job

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
the job

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.350 
the job
I'd<00:05:42.780> say<00:05:43.440> swallow<00:05:44.039> your<00:05:44.250> pride<00:05:44.400> try<00:05:45.150> one<00:05:45.330> out

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
I'd say swallow your pride try one out

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.249 
I'd say swallow your pride try one out
you<00:05:45.960> might<00:05:46.259> just<00:05:46.500> like<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:50.539> you<00:05:51.539> know<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:51.720> really

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
you might just like it you know I really

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.140 
you might just like it you know I really
really<00:05:52.590> do<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.919> this<00:05:53.099> bergman<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.759> don't<00:05:54.000> mind

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
really do like this bergman I don't mind

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.640 
really do like this bergman I don't mind
admitting<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.900> think<00:05:55.289> it's<00:05:55.409> the<00:05:55.470> only

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
admitting it I think it's the only

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.260 
admitting it I think it's the only
scooter<00:05:56.159> really<00:05:56.460> at<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.669> moment<00:05:56.820> that's<00:05:57.120> got

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
scooter really at the moment that's got

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.839 
scooter really at the moment that's got
any<00:05:57.419> real<00:05:57.630> respect<00:05:58.199> from<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.830> bike<00:05:59.220> world<00:05:59.520> if

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
any real respect from the bike world if

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.270 
any real respect from the bike world if
you<00:05:59.940> like<00:06:00.150> but<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.380> very<00:06:01.530> very<00:06:01.770> comfy<00:06:02.220> you
