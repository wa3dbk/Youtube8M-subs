00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hey YouTube okay so the problem that I

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.809 
hey YouTube okay so the problem that I
was<00:00:04.200> having<00:00:04.589> was<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:05.009> thermostat<00:00:05.370> was<00:00:05.609> going

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
was having was my thermostat was going

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.150 
was having was my thermostat was going
bad<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.810> was<00:00:06.930> stuck<00:00:07.109> open<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.770> obviously

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
bad so it was stuck open and obviously

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.620 
bad so it was stuck open and obviously
my<00:00:08.309> engine<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:08.670> under<00:00:08.910> heating<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.389> torque

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
my engine was under heating in my torque

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.669 
my engine was under heating in my torque
converter<00:00:09.929> wouldn't<00:00:10.260> lock

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
converter wouldn't lock

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.200 
converter wouldn't lock
I<00:00:10.790> went<00:00:11.790> 30<00:00:12.120> miles<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:13.009> I<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.969> maybe

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I went 30 miles on I think it was maybe

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.890 
I went 30 miles on I think it was maybe
Tuesday<00:00:16.039> with<00:00:17.039> no<00:00:17.220> torque<00:00:17.520> lockup<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.420> that's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
Tuesday with no torque lockup so that's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
Tuesday with no torque lockup so that's
not<00:00:19.109> good<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.949> all<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.210> locking<00:00:21.390> up

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
not good at all and it's not locking up

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.060 
not good at all and it's not locking up
right<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.320> engines<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.800> warm

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
right now because the engines not warm

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.290 
right now because the engines not warm
so<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.930> waiting<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> lock<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.699> get

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so I'm waiting for it to lock up or get

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.640 
so I'm waiting for it to lock up or get
warm<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:27.840> I'll<00:00:27.960> show<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> lock-up

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
warm and then I'll show you the lock-up

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.700 
warm and then I'll show you the lock-up
feature<00:00:29.750> what<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
feature what was going on was like I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.080 
feature what was going on was like I
said<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:32.009> thermostat<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.850> stuck

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
said my thermostat was just stuck

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.639 
said my thermostat was just stuck
completely<00:00:33.570> open<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.230> letting<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
completely open it was letting all the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.270 
completely open it was letting all the
fluid<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:37.350> top<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:40.219> was<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
fluid go in and on top of that was I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.959 
fluid go in and on top of that was I
gonna<00:00:41.399> say<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> taking<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> while<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> warm

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
gonna say this is taking a while to warm

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
gonna say this is taking a while to warm
up<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.200> pretty

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
up but that's just because it is pretty

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.000 
up but that's just because it is pretty
cold<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:51.289> it<00:00:52.289> should<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.620> getting<00:00:52.829> warm

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
cold out here it should be getting warm

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
cold out here it should be getting warm
within<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> next<00:00:53.550> minute<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.300> had<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> add

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
within like the next minute I had to add

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.069 
within like the next minute I had to add
a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.230> coolant<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> was

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
a little bit more coolant because it was

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.310 
a little bit more coolant because it was
there<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> problem<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.829> it<00:01:00.140> which<00:01:01.140> imma

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
there was a problem with it which imma

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
there was a problem with it which imma
call<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.840> was<00:01:04.049> low<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.549> obviously

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
call it it was low because the obviously

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
call it it was low because the obviously
when<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.790> remove<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
when you take when you remove the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
when you take when you remove the
thermostat<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> coolant<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.200> spill<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
thermostat that coolant will spill out a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
thermostat that coolant will spill out a
little<00:01:10.740> bit<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.070> lost<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.400> half<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> course

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
little bit we lost about half of course

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
little bit we lost about half of course
so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:13.020> distilled<00:01:13.470> water<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.220> helps

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so I use distilled water and that helps

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.679 
so I use distilled water and that helps
seemed<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> help<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> won't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
seemed to help a little bit it won't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
seemed to help a little bit it won't
freeze<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.229> because<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> cold<00:01:17.280> out

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
freeze up because it's not that cold out

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.980 
freeze up because it's not that cold out
it<00:01:17.729> doesn't<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> cold<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it doesn't get that cold out here and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
it doesn't get that cold out here and
plus<00:01:19.530> there's<00:01:19.710> still<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:19.979> 30<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.520> 45

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
plus there's still about 30 or 45

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.130 
plus there's still about 30 or 45
percent<00:01:22.340> 45<00:01:23.340> percent<00:01:23.460> coolant<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.270> okay

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
percent 45 percent coolant in there okay

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
percent 45 percent coolant in there okay
so<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.619> beginning<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> lock<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.610> here

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so now it's beginning to lock so here

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
so now it's beginning to lock so here
here's<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.299> here's<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
here's not here's what you're going to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
here's not here's what you're going to
see<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.650> transmission<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> motor<00:01:29.549> at

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
see the transmission and motor at

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.960 
see the transmission and motor at
operating<00:01:30.329> temperature<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.460> well<00:01:32.460> ah<00:01:32.490> look

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
operating temperature and well ah look

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
operating temperature and well ah look
at<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> locked<00:01:33.720> perfect<00:01:34.409> leads<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> gear

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
at that it locked perfect leads and gear

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
at that it locked perfect leads and gear
ready<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:37.140> noticed<00:01:37.650> though<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ready to go I have noticed though that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.760 
ready to go I have noticed though that
it<00:01:38.159> still<00:01:38.430> does<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.790> whole<00:01:39.060> bouncing<00:01:39.750> tack<00:01:40.020> my

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it still does the whole bouncing tack my

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
it still does the whole bouncing tack my
mom's<00:01:41.070> does<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> too<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.600> thinking<00:01:42.930> that's

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
mom's does it too so I'm thinking that's

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.240 
mom's does it too so I'm thinking that's
just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.409> normal<00:01:43.740> feature<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.820> like

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
just a normal feature because it's like

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.270 
just a normal feature because it's like
what's<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.030> called<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:48.260> just<00:01:48.470> does<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.890> just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
what's it called it just does it just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.980 
what's it called it just does it just
hasn't<00:01:49.490> locked<00:01:49.820> up<00:01:49.970> completely<00:01:50.420> yet<00:01:50.750> because

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
hasn't locked up completely yet because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.900 
hasn't locked up completely yet because
obviously<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> car<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.040> decelerating<00:01:52.760> and

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
obviously the car is decelerating and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.480 
obviously the car is decelerating and
you're<00:01:53.000> about<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.390> accelerate<00:01:54.140> again<00:01:54.490> one

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you're about to accelerate again one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.950 
you're about to accelerate again one
good<00:01:55.670> thing<00:01:55.700> about<00:01:55.820> Honda's<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> fact

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
good thing about Honda's is the fact

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.600 
good thing about Honda's is the fact
that<00:01:57.170> even<00:01:57.350> though<00:01:57.620> you're<00:01:57.800> at<00:01:57.980> about<00:01:58.220> 50

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that even though you're at about 50

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520 
that even though you're at about 50
miles<00:01:58.790> an<00:01:59.000> hour<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.420> car<00:01:59.450> will<00:01:59.780> still<00:02:00.050> unlock

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
miles an hour the car will still unlock

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.680 
miles an hour the car will still unlock
a<00:02:00.560> little<00:02:00.890> bit<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.670> give<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.060> extra<00:02:02.090> push

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
a little bit to give you that extra push

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.650 
a little bit to give you that extra push
so<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.830> won't<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.430> won't<00:02:04.550> oh<00:02:04.790> they<00:02:05.150> won't<00:02:05.300> I

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
so it won't it won't oh they won't I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.620 
so it won't it won't oh they won't I
cannot<00:02:06.260> talk<00:02:06.500> today<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.430> won't<00:02:07.850> lock<00:02:08.270> up

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
cannot talk today it won't lock up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.620 
cannot talk today it won't lock up
completely<00:02:09.440> until<00:02:09.979> probably<00:02:10.160> about<00:02:10.460> over<00:02:11.210> 50

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
completely until probably about over 50

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.780 
completely until probably about over 50
miles<00:02:11.840> an<00:02:12.080> hour<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.460> something<00:02:13.670> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
miles an hour so that's something that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.020 
miles an hour so that's something that
you'll<00:02:13.970> have<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.180> wait<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:15.400> overall<00:02:16.400> though<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
you'll have to wait for overall though I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.760 
you'll have to wait for overall though I
mean<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.660> said<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:17.960> at<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> hundred<00:02:18.440> fifty

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
mean like I said I'm at a hundred fifty

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.420 
mean like I said I'm at a hundred fifty
thousand<00:02:19.250> miles<00:02:19.459> I've<00:02:19.850> gone<00:02:20.800> 111<00:02:21.800> no<00:02:22.100> there's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
thousand miles I've gone 111 no there's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.840 
thousand miles I've gone 111 no there's
no<00:02:22.930> 113<00:02:23.930> miles<00:02:24.170> since<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.920> video<00:02:25.280> on<00:02:25.459> Sunday

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
no 113 miles since the video on Sunday

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
that I have to be careful with because I

you know I got I gotta be ready to put
stuff<00:02:35.990> on<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.380> just<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.490> old<00:02:37.820> but

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
stuff on it just because it is old but

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.530 
stuff on it just because it is old but
at<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.600> same<00:02:38.810> time<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> runs<00:02:39.890> very<00:02:40.130> very<00:02:40.459> well

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.930 

the<00:02:44.540> transmissions<00:02:45.230> doing<00:02:45.590> well<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.190> service

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the transmissions doing well I service

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.770 
the transmissions doing well I service
that<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.480> that's<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.870> good<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:50.510> changed

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
that so that's all good and I changed

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.770 
that so that's all good and I changed
the<00:02:50.870> oil<00:02:50.900> I'm<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.530> high<00:02:51.769> mileage<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.600> said

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the oil I'm on high mileage like I said

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.440 
the oil I'm on high mileage like I said
in<00:02:53.870> my<00:02:53.959> other<00:02:53.989> video<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.760> last<00:02:56.000> person<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
in my other video the the last person I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.570 
in my other video the the last person I
was<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.019> they<00:02:57.200> put<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.650> sympathetic<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
was going to they put in sympathetic and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580 
was going to they put in sympathetic and
that's<00:02:58.730> not<00:02:58.970> good<00:02:59.209> for<00:02:59.239> an<00:02:59.630> older<00:02:59.930> car<00:03:00.230> just

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that's not good for an older car just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's not good for an older car just
because<00:03:00.830> it's<00:03:00.980> thinner<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.209> obviously<00:03:02.690> an

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
because it's thinner and obviously an

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.420 
because it's thinner and obviously an
older<00:03:03.170> car<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.680> burn<00:03:03.860> oil<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.280> lot

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
older car is going to burn oil a lot

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.800 
older car is going to burn oil a lot
faster<00:03:04.970> that's<00:03:05.150> when<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.330> need<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.510> start

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
faster that's when you need to start

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.410 
faster that's when you need to start
doing<00:03:05.930> your<00:03:06.260> oil<00:03:07.220> changes<00:03:07.730> luckily<00:03:08.269> this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
doing your oil changes luckily this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.650 
doing your oil changes luckily this
Honda<00:03:08.690> doesn't<00:03:09.080> burn<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.390> heard

converter locked up beautifully that was
my<00:03:20.959> main<00:03:21.170> concern<00:03:21.530> was<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.769> fact<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:22.160> it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
my main concern was the fact that it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.009 
my main concern was the fact that it
wasn't<00:03:22.519> locking<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:23.120> correctly<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.870> read

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
wasn't locking up correctly and I read

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.590 
wasn't locking up correctly and I read
an<00:03:24.110> article<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:26.150> has<00:03:26.269> something<00:03:26.480> to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
an article that the it has something to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.840 
an article that the it has something to
do<00:03:26.750> with<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.900> thermostat<00:03:27.530> because<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.820> a

lock-up clutch my check engine light

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.660 
lock-up clutch my check engine light
would<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.680> come<00:03:30.830> on<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.190> my<00:03:31.280> car<00:03:31.489> would<00:03:31.640> have

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
would have come on and my car would have

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.320 
would have come on and my car would have
stalled<00:03:31.970> out<00:03:32.150> so

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
stalled out so

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.540 
stalled out so
I<00:03:34.390> mean<00:03:35.080> push<00:03:35.380> comes<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.710> shove<00:03:36.070> if<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.340> had<00:03:36.460> to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
I mean push comes to shove if I had to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.680 
I mean push comes to shove if I had to
get<00:03:36.670> one<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.910> those<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.270> would<00:03:37.390> really<00:03:37.570> suck

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
get one of those that would really suck

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.480 
get one of those that would really suck
I<00:03:38.080> wouldn't<00:03:38.320> be<00:03:38.380> driving<00:03:38.740> for<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.010> while

I wouldn't be driving for a while
but<00:03:40.230> overall<00:03:41.230> though<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:42.100> simple<00:03:42.940> thing

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
but overall though you know simple thing

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.820 
but overall though you know simple thing
that<00:03:43.360> can<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.570> fixed<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.410> not<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> really

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
that can be fixed it's like not a really

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.990 
that can be fixed it's like not a really
big<00:03:45.010> deal<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.370> need<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.610> clean<00:03:45.760> off<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
big deal I do need to clean off the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.510 
big deal I do need to clean off the
engine<00:03:46.450> though<00:03:46.600> it's<00:03:47.040> basically<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.370> the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
engine though it's basically like the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.710 
engine though it's basically like the
engine<00:03:48.820> looks<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:50.290> been<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.570> been

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
engine looks like it's been but has been

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.270 
engine looks like it's been but has been
thrown<00:03:52.960> at<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.170> basically<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:53.920> what<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.070> looks

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
thrown at it basically is what it looks

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.860 
thrown at it basically is what it looks
like<00:03:54.460> so<00:03:55.180> I'm<00:03:55.240> just<00:03:55.360> gonna<00:03:55.480> wait<00:03:55.630> for<00:03:55.780> this

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
like so I'm just gonna wait for this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
like so I'm just gonna wait for this
light<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.170> turn<00:03:56.350> green<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.920> then<00:03:57.610> we'll<00:03:57.760> go

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
light to turn green and then we'll go

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.420 
light to turn green and then we'll go
from<00:03:57.940> there<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.890> about<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> get<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
from there just about to get on the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.730 
from there just about to get on the
highway<00:04:00.580> sorry<00:04:01.060> that's<00:04:01.390> my<00:04:01.570> radio<00:04:02.020> I<00:04:02.260> had<00:04:02.590> my

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
highway sorry that's my radio I had my

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.760 
highway sorry that's my radio I had my
phone<00:04:02.920> plugged<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.850> my<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:05.680> I'm

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
phone plugged in and it's on my now I'm

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.110 
phone plugged in and it's on my now I'm
recording<00:04:06.220> with<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:11.400> it's<00:04:12.400> surprising<00:04:13.000> though

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
recording with it it's surprising though

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.420 
recording with it it's surprising though
how<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.690> little<00:04:14.260> thing<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.650> thermostat<00:04:15.130> can

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
how a little thing like a thermostat can

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.180 
how a little thing like a thermostat can
control<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.850> way<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.090> car<00:04:16.269> functions<00:04:16.840> I

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
control the way the car functions I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.380 
control the way the car functions I
didn't<00:04:18.190> realize<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.730> but<00:04:18.850> my<00:04:18.970> engine<00:04:19.299> was

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
didn't realize it but my engine was

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.750 
didn't realize it but my engine was
getting<00:04:19.690> rather<00:04:19.810> very<00:04:20.140> cold<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.580> wasn't

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
getting rather very cold and it wasn't

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.280 
getting rather very cold and it wasn't
an<00:04:21.910> operating<00:04:22.330> temperature<00:04:22.480> at<00:04:22.840> all<00:04:22.960> and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
an operating temperature at all and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.230 
an operating temperature at all and
we'll<00:04:23.830> actually<00:04:24.010> see<00:04:24.250> if<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.730> low<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:25.060> coolant

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
we'll actually see if I'm low on coolant

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.930 
we'll actually see if I'm low on coolant
because<00:04:25.720> my<00:04:25.870> engine<00:04:26.170> will<00:04:26.290> overheat<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:27.310> I'm

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
because my engine will overheat so I'm

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.540 
because my engine will overheat so I'm
hoping<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.720> doesn't<00:04:28.960> happen<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:29.740> then

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
hoping that doesn't happen because then

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.980 
hoping that doesn't happen because then
that<00:04:30.760> means<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:31.120> I'll<00:04:31.360> have<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.630> put<00:04:31.810> more

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
that means that I'll have to put more

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.370 
that means that I'll have to put more
water<00:04:32.200> in<00:04:33.180> like<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.330> said<00:04:34.360> I'm<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.840> still<00:04:34.960> have<00:04:35.350> a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
water in like I said I'm I still have a

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.680 
water in like I said I'm I still have a
crapload<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.100> coolant<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.640> there<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.120> didn't

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
crapload of coolant in there so I didn't

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.260 
crapload of coolant in there so I didn't
lose<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:37.900> much<00:04:38.490> but<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.640> did<00:04:39.820> spew<00:04:40.150> out

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
lose that much but it did spew out

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.930 
lose that much but it did spew out
pretty<00:04:40.510> quickly<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:44.820> luckily<00:04:45.820> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
pretty quickly and luckily the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.310 
pretty quickly and luckily the
thermostat<00:04:46.419> was<00:04:46.540> on<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.780> bottom<00:04:47.110> hose

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
thermostat was on the bottom hose

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.580 
thermostat was on the bottom hose
towards<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> Taurus<00:04:48.550> well<00:04:49.360> okay<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.260> engines

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
towards the Taurus well okay the engines

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.740 
towards the Taurus well okay the engines
in<00:04:50.710> sideways<00:04:51.160> so<00:04:51.460> towards<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.970> left<00:04:52.450> side<00:04:52.660> of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
in sideways so towards the left side of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.600 
in sideways so towards the left side of
the<00:04:52.810> engine<00:04:53.140> or<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.350> back<00:04:53.860> dude<00:04:54.370> you're

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
the engine or the back dude you're

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.260 
the engine or the back dude you're
running<00:04:54.850> a<00:04:54.940> red<00:04:55.090> light<00:04:55.120> it's<00:04:55.540> not<00:04:55.630> okay

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
running a red light it's not okay

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.980 
running a red light it's not okay
towards<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.330> back<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.570> engine<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:58.930> it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
towards the back of the engine so it

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.410 
towards the back of the engine so it
wasn't<00:04:59.260> that<00:04:59.290> hard<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.620> remove<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.040> hose

perfect lockup and it seemed like it was
locking<00:05:26.230> up<00:05:26.320> in<00:05:26.440> two<00:05:26.620> stages<00:05:26.830> before<00:05:27.160> but<00:05:27.550> now

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670

New<00:05:55.960> York<00:05:56.100> but<00:05:57.100> they<00:05:57.970> do<00:05:58.030> still<00:05:58.300> have<00:05:58.690> that

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
New York but they do still have that

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.540 
New York but they do still have that
tire<00:05:59.140> problem<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.800> I<00:05:59.830> don't<00:05:59.890> feel<00:06:00.130> safe<00:06:00.400> doing

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
tire problem and I don't feel safe doing

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.160 
tire problem and I don't feel safe doing
a<00:06:00.760> zero<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.030> sixty<00:06:01.390> on<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:01.690> just<00:06:01.840> for<00:06:02.050> that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
a zero to sixty on it just for that

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.740 
a zero to sixty on it just for that
reason<00:06:02.200> is<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.710> fact<00:06:02.920> that<00:06:02.980> these<00:06:03.220> roads

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
reason is the fact that these roads

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.120 
reason is the fact that these roads
Vegas<00:06:04.750> roads<00:06:05.020> are<00:06:05.170> very<00:06:05.200> bumpy<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.040> they're

Vegas roads are very bumpy and they're

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.880 
Vegas roads are very bumpy and they're
very<00:06:06.280> turbulent<00:06:06.670> so<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.270> really<00:06:07.720> don't<00:06:07.870> want<00:06:08.050> to

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
very turbulent so I really don't want to

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.770 
very turbulent so I really don't want to
