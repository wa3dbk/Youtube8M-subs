difference<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.710> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
difference is there this is more of a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.050 
difference is there this is more of a
spear<00:02:25.810> points<00:02:26.110> kind<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> dagger<00:02:27.460> pretty

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
spear points kind of a dagger pretty

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.110 
spear points kind of a dagger pretty
much<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.920> has<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.190> little<00:02:30.490> bit<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.760> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
much and this has a little bit more of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.150 
much and this has a little bit more of
well<00:02:31.810> they<00:02:31.960> both<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.350> same<00:02:32.380> belly<00:02:32.830> but

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
well they both have the same belly but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.400 
well they both have the same belly but
the<00:02:33.280> tip<00:02:33.520> trails<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.290> know

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
the tip trails more so it would you know

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.690 
the tip trails more so it would you know
slice<00:02:35.860> through<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.520> but<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.860> these<00:02:39.100> good

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
slice through more but are these good

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.290 
slice through more but are these good
for<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> money<00:02:41.640> after<00:02:42.640> handling<00:02:43.060> these<00:02:43.240> a

cost yeah I mean they are they are worth
it<00:02:55.800> I've<00:02:56.800> had<00:02:57.070> I've<00:02:57.340> read<00:02:57.670> reports<00:02:57.880> that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
it I've had I've read reports that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.540 
it I've had I've read reports that
people<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.870> batard<00:02:59.350> through<00:02:59.739> wood<00:03:00.010> with

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
people have batard through wood with

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.930 
people have batard through wood with
these<00:03:00.760> knives<00:03:01.020> me<00:03:02.020> personally<00:03:02.770> just<00:03:03.550> because

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
these knives me personally just because

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.060 
these knives me personally just because
I<00:03:03.970> think<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.450> tang<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.750> fairly<00:03:05.410> thin<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.920> mean

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
I think the tang is fairly thin I mean

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.100 
I think the tang is fairly thin I mean
the<00:03:06.340> handle<00:03:06.700> itself<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.239> thin<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.870> Tang

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
the handle itself is thin so the Tang

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.840 
the handle itself is thin so the Tang
must<00:03:08.350> be<00:03:08.470> pretty<00:03:08.830> thin<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.400> through<00:03:09.670> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
must be pretty thin to go through that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.170 
must be pretty thin to go through that
so<00:03:10.690> me<00:03:10.900> personally<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.560> would<00:03:12.010> not<00:03:12.040> baton<00:03:12.910> with

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so me personally I would not baton with

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.570 
so me personally I would not baton with
this<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:14.110> read<00:03:14.440> reports<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.220> reviews

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.029 
could actually accommodate every
possible<00:05:45.099> grip<00:05:45.429> what<00:05:45.879> i<00:05:45.909> mean<00:05:46.119> by<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.329> is

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
possible grip what i mean by that is

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.279 
possible grip what i mean by that is
hammer<00:05:48.039> grip<00:05:48.479> edge<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:50.319> hammer<00:05:50.559> grip<00:05:52.289> sabre

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
hammer grip edge and hammer grip sabre

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.779 
hammer grip edge and hammer grip sabre
grip<00:05:54.989> reverse<00:05:55.989> grip<00:05:56.319> but<00:05:56.860> also<00:05:57.009> edge<00:05:57.429> in

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
grip reverse grip but also edge in

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.129 
grip reverse grip but also edge in
reverse<00:05:58.179> grip<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:59.949> also<00:06:00.129> the<00:06:00.579> the<00:06:01.139> filipino

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
reverse grip and also the the filipino

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.139 
reverse grip and also the the filipino
grip<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:02.679> i<00:06:03.159> don't<00:06:03.339> think<00:06:03.399> they<00:06:03.699> meant<00:06:03.879> that

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
grip and i don't think they meant that

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.369 
grip and i don't think they meant that
at<00:06:04.300> all<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.449> usually<00:06:05.229> if<00:06:05.379> i<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:06.610> guard<00:06:07.379> usually

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
at all so usually if i the guard usually

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.739 
at all so usually if i the guard usually
will<00:06:08.949> kind<00:06:09.189> of<00:06:09.279> prevent<00:06:09.699> the<00:06:09.879> edge<00:06:10.029> end<00:06:10.419> grips

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749 
will kind of prevent the edge end grips

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.409 
will kind of prevent the edge end grips
or<00:06:11.739> it<00:06:11.889> will<00:06:12.039> prevent<00:06:12.369> the<00:06:12.579> saber<00:06:12.849> grip<00:06:13.209> but

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
or it will prevent the saber grip but

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.329 
or it will prevent the saber grip but
because<00:06:13.779> this<00:06:14.019> part<00:06:14.259> of<00:06:14.349> the<00:06:14.439> guard<00:06:14.649> is<00:06:14.860> skewed

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:15.339 
because this part of the guard is skewed

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.729 
because this part of the guard is skewed
you<00:06:16.119> can<00:06:16.300> actually<00:06:16.659> use<00:06:16.929> the<00:06:17.169> guard<00:06:17.409> as<00:06:17.679> a

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:17.739 
you can actually use the guard as a

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:20.790 
you can actually use the guard as a
thumb<00:06:18.309> ramp<00:06:18.579> for<00:06:18.909> the<00:06:18.969> saber<00:06:19.329> and<00:06:19.800> because

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
thumb ramp for the saber and because

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.790 
thumb ramp for the saber and because
this<00:06:21.309> part<00:06:21.759> is<00:06:21.879> choked<00:06:22.269> in<00:06:22.539> you<00:06:23.259> know<00:06:23.379> usually

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
this part is choked in you know usually

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.559 
this part is choked in you know usually
there's<00:06:24.009> a<00:06:24.069> child<00:06:24.399> here<00:06:24.849> in<00:06:24.879> this<00:06:25.149> part<00:06:25.449> is

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
there's a child here in this part is

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.929 
there's a child here in this part is
there's<00:06:25.929> no<00:06:26.110> child<00:06:26.409> there<00:06:26.829> or<00:06:27.129> finger<00:06:27.489> choil<00:06:27.699> i

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
there's no child there or finger choil i

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.089 
there's no child there or finger choil i
should<00:06:28.179> say<00:06:28.389> but<00:06:28.869> this<00:06:29.050> is<00:06:29.259> choked<00:06:29.619> in<00:06:29.829> both

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
should say but this is choked in both

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.399 
should say but this is choked in both
ways<00:06:30.399> which<00:06:31.119> means<00:06:31.360> you<00:06:31.539> can<00:06:31.719> hold<00:06:31.959> it<00:06:32.110> either

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
ways which means you can hold it either

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.799 
ways which means you can hold it either
way<00:06:32.709> and<00:06:33.039> it's<00:06:33.399> comfortable<00:06:33.849> that's<00:06:34.360> just<00:06:34.569> a

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:34.809 
way and it's comfortable that's just a

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:36.600 
way and it's comfortable that's just a
little<00:06:35.379> weird<00:06:35.709> thing<00:06:35.979> i<00:06:36.129> found<00:06:36.339> out<00:06:36.550> about
