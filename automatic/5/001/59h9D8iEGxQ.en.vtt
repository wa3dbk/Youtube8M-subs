00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.880
 all hello to you smith and I continue 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.330
 pass 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.080
 matrix weekdays and the next mission i'm already in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 the building 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.250
 food to rescue morpheus she is a little 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.810
 reminds the very first that is before 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.439
 difficulty level test 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 games that I failed a bit since 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.519
 played the first time the first aid kit fell out 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.300
 fair 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.739
 but no, I won't need it anyway 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 great just now it turns out 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.300
 destroy all opponents I picked up 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.329
 another first-aid kit 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.539
 amazing just happening now 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 the action on the screen slowed down 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.100
 time stuff it all passes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.180
 film atmosphere 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:02.160
 so the top right corner is visible so it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 what fell grenades in the general upper right 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.740
 the corner is a health indicator 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.229
 morpheus and need to catch it in the course 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 reinforcements in a hurry in general need to catch 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.090
 destroy all enemies before 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 morpheus health indicator runs out 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 which is green for now 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.909
 blinking but soon it will be red at all 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.320
 this is some 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:30.740
 but this is not me this is not new then this 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.740
 wildly sticking someone new 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.159
 so somewhere out there hid well 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.560
 show yourself rays 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.700
 bastard 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.350
 kick curves and special forces in general and somehow 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.229
 strangely they are dressed these kind of was 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 form but they have some kind of horrible shape 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:06.480
 but this one here is the color of the pants I do not remember how 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:10.400
 called wanted in general no matter he 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.270
 Generally without a helmet only body armor and 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 armed with a shotgun along the way is the commander 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.220
 yes here it was an indicator of health 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.960
 shown it must be killed probably him 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 it was necessary to kill at first but okay, so 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.670
 the morpheus is still holding grenades 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.640
 still in the drawer i don't know took them or 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 I don't have time yet 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.360
 understand how to take them is not me 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.300
 probably took but not the essence of them uncomfortable and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.250
 I used it and picked it up 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.160
 not automatic this rifle m16 in the course 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.680
 The sight has changed so well, let's try 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.040
 I did not manage to take this box 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.800
 immediately a new wave of enemies came running 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.460
 now to experience with shields this one 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:11.930
 so hateful for you grenade these 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.930
 bastards know how to throw them well 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.230
 yes, let's continue with 3 cops 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.470
 shields what is the enemy 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.360
 apply 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.800
 pointless shoot them all the same 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.140
 best of all is 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.900
 melee somehow about pests bastard but 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.660
 I can get in from the back I can knock out the shield 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.850
 well I hope they do not know how to lift 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.140
 looking now i will finish it 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.870
 there is one ready two left too 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.459
 on the way, I still collect weapons but 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.730
 inefficient now but my condition 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.500
 Health is not happy, I can now 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.480
 die 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.290
 I would like to start again now I 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.489
 reproduced 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:08.980
 com Bulgarians and threw almost finished off 2 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.549
 special forces with a shield but there are already 3 of us 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.280
 approach 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.440
 Excellent Triniti Finish that I 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.190
 I threw back what is usually left here I 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.139
 squad leader 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.100
 which is already in the process of destruction as 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.169
 he flies brushes slows down all that what 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.690
 where else did I kill everyone 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:38.020
 oh who is this and I learn to throw grenades 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.590
 well, you need to run away, but one survived 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.190
 the rotten creature also hides behind hiding 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.760
 column okay i'm already hand to hand on 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:54.630
 I drink that this is a countdown to 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.630
 elevator divides and won at the end 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.419
