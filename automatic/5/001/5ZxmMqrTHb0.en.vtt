would like to go one circuit at a time

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.610 
would like to go one circuit at a time
and<00:00:19.039> a<00:00:19.130> circuit<00:00:19.490> is<00:00:19.610> roughly<00:00:20.290> 10,000<00:00:21.290> neurons

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 
and a circuit is roughly 10,000 neurons

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.950 
and a circuit is roughly 10,000 neurons
with<00:00:22.040> tens<00:00:22.790> of<00:00:23.030> millions<00:00:23.360> of<00:00:23.480> connections

between those neurons to understand one
of<00:00:26.270> these<00:00:26.450> circuits<00:00:26.810> you'd<00:00:26.990> really<00:00:27.230> want<00:00:27.410> two

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
of these circuits you'd really want two

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.470 
of these circuits you'd really want two
things<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:28.370> want<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.700> know<00:00:28.790> what<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.150> circuit

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
things you want to know what the circuit

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.750 
things you want to know what the circuit
does<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:30.050> how<00:00:30.200> it<00:00:30.230> doesn't<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.370> we<00:00:31.400> did<00:00:31.640> this

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
does and how it doesn't so we did this

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.520 
does and how it doesn't so we did this
study<00:00:31.970> in<00:00:32.149> two<00:00:32.329> parts<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.020> first<00:00:33.050> part<00:00:33.440> it's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
study in two parts the first part it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.869 
study in two parts the first part it's
actually<00:00:33.890> something<00:00:34.129> we've<00:00:34.460> been<00:00:34.550> doing<00:00:34.850> for

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
actually something we've been doing for

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.939 
actually something we've been doing for
five<00:00:35.180> or<00:00:35.360> six<00:00:35.390> years<00:00:35.780> now<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:36.649> literally

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
five or six years now and it's literally

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.900 
five or six years now and it's literally
watching<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.760> brain<00:00:37.940> see<00:00:38.329> on<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.550> left<00:00:40.730> is<00:00:40.879> a

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
watching the brain see on the left is a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.790 
watching the brain see on the left is a
movie<00:00:41.269> we<00:00:41.390> showed<00:00:41.600> an<00:00:41.780> animal<00:00:42.140> on<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.620> right

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
movie we showed an animal on the right

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.680 
movie we showed an animal on the right
you<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:42.949> 50<00:00:43.579> neurons<00:00:43.879> that<00:00:44.120> are<00:00:44.269> flashing

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
you see 50 neurons that are flashing

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.079 
you see 50 neurons that are flashing
away<00:00:44.780> in<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.199> animals<00:00:45.620> brain<00:00:45.879> every<00:00:46.879> time<00:00:47.059> a

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
away in the animals brain every time a

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.360 
away in the animals brain every time a
neuron<00:00:47.449> gets<00:00:47.749> bright<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:48.350> firing<00:00:48.859> in<00:00:48.980> fact

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
neuron gets bright it's firing in fact

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.829 
neuron gets bright it's firing in fact
these<00:00:49.550> neurons<00:00:49.879> are<00:00:50.030> reacting<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.629> very

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
these neurons are reacting to very

these neurons are reacting to very
specific<00:00:51.379> elements<00:00:51.530> in<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.069> visual<00:00:52.399> scene

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
specific elements in the visual scene

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.610 
specific elements in the visual scene
the<00:00:53.420> big<00:00:53.569> challenge<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.109> tracing<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
the big challenge is tracing the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.959 
the big challenge is tracing the
physical<00:00:55.010> connections<00:00:55.460> between<00:00:55.670> these

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
physical connections between these

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.000 
physical connections between these
particular<00:00:56.600> neurons<00:00:56.960> which<00:00:57.530> brings<00:00:57.800> us<00:00:57.979> to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
particular neurons which brings us to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.069 
particular neurons which brings us to
the<00:00:58.219> second<00:00:58.550> part<00:00:58.729> of<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.879> study<00:00:59.089> so<00:00:59.780> this<00:00:59.929> is

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
the second part of the study so this is

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.959 
the second part of the study so this is
the<00:01:00.199> electron<00:01:00.589> microscope<00:01:00.979> that<00:01:01.429> we<00:01:01.579> use<00:01:01.760> to
