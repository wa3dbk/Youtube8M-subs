00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.850
 she is the people of youtube how are we going 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.640
 how about summer how beautiful to deliver 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.860
 out on the beach the pool as the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.130
 I was around here cleaning house 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.110
 and see what I found 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.570
 fix some cufflinks that I already have 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.650
 of makes the pile of years 13 kilos each 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.720
 a super old and good to see them between 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.660
 that untrained and had to do something 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.210
 and remembering a little of what he tells me 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.099
 many people I have weight in my house I have 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.540
 some barbell some bar but no 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.310
 I can do great things do not happen the same 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.829
 that in a gym but I wanted 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.329
 take advantage and explain how to simply 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.220
 using a little bit the head we can 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.810
 practice this work all the parts 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 of the body after doing a workout 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.820
 handsome handsome quality hypertrophy 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 perfectly if it is what you want and without 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.540
 leaving home without 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.460
 materials and if so we keep about 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.070
 how many kilos that help us, it is already 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.830
 I better show you what I'm going to teach you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
 that I have here as I have mounted here 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.030
 in my house to do the training 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.180
 today looks like the leroy catalog 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 merlin like that it is but but good not you 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.850
 you scare if you stay here for a while 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.250
 with me you are going to see what we are going to roll 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.759
 until you are going to ride, stay 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.759
 I'm with me 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 good friends training of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.190
 hypertrophy specifically home 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.870
 three higher the first exercise that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.540
 let's do it's going to be rowing an arm 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.160
 with dumbbells as you see is not typical 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 I'm not leaning on any furniture 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.700
 no chair I'm doing it on 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 I 'm like I 'm doing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.930
 push-ups to an arm this this makes 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.110
 chop the exercise three more times 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 making it much more effective the body 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.930
 has to stabilize a lot more than 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 if we were doing it on a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 chair 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.320
 supporting us on a bench in this 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.229
 case works the abdomen works in a way 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.660
 isometric the shoulder the breastplate with what 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.490
 which is already giving you a plus that remains 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.229
 normal we would not have and just with 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.050
 13 kilos we will want to die with 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.000
 those 13 kilos today I have laces 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.240
 I have stiffness now that I've already 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.880
 Finish and fabric the following exercise 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.100
 are 20 seconds isometric 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 static push-ups we're not going to 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.480
 make them moving because in this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.680
 case we do not want to work the pectoral 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.570
 doing great strength but the only thing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.370
 we want to pre activate what already 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.380
 be a bit fatigued for the next 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.050
 exercise that we are going to do 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.390
 in the dumbbell press on bench 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.680
 flat or in this case better said about 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.810
 a plane we are going to do here the press with 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120
 dumbbells are 13 kilos is not a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.850
 great effort but as I said to the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.490
 to be lying pulled the pectoral the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.770
 deltoids of the previous exercise as the 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.130
 it's really more annoying 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.650
 that is normal and good let's go 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 between 10 12 repetitions we could 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.710
 get to 15 if we go too much I in 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.750
 this round I do not know if I've done 10 or 12 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.150
 you can count perfectly but let's go 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.410
 they start to sting something bad bad thing 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.410
 that we will see 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.550
 in this case now the next 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.620
 exercise that we are going to do according to 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.920
 we let the dumbbells are abdominal 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 oblique in this case was to put a 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.260
 passive recovery we are totally 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.360
 still and recover minute minute and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.830
 medium or in this case I have decided a 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.470
 active recovery to give you a 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.900
 little bit more of vidilla to training 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.030
 I have chosen oblique abdominals and 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.320
 which are 15 per part with which we 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.240
 He left a little more time for 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.640
 recover and above all the intention is 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.620
 rest all the upper train you can 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.040
 choose another exercise but let you 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.500
 recover the upper triceps train 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.210
 pectoral deltoids because the exercise 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.280
 next I'm going to speed up a little bit 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.530
 these these abs because if not 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.200
 let's throw here three hours and well 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.140
 now the next exercise are going to be 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.330
 this time if push-ups but biometric 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.190
 because I pio metrics because when 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.680
 we accelerate our body in this case 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.630
 jumping and clapping 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.890
 working more power and for this 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.900
 they have to work some fibers of the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.210
 pectorals other than those that would work 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.360
 if we did normal push-ups 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.400
 fibers fast fibers that of normal by 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.410
 the intensity of the weight of our body 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.310
 Unless we spent a lot we did not know 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.350
 they are going to activate and well let's get to 10 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.260
 repetitions although it costs a lot to arrive 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.020
 and later in super series we are going to 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.370
 get on these chairs in this case I 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.960
 I chose two chairs because I can more or 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.730
 least maintain control but have 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.100
 careful because you can wobble a 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.410
 little bit and you can fall down but well let's go 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.180
 to make here funds to the failure in which 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.090
 arrive here and to finish 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.290
 fatigue and burst the pectoral shoulders and 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.850
 sad that are what are most 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.540
 working also works 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.190
 stability logically after this 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.590
 As you can see I've already cut the video but 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.810
 It would be advisable if we want to lengthen 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.870
 a little bit more the round catch and do 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.300
 for example some skipping 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.920
 a gentle trot if you are not at home if 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.870
 you can do it ladder 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.450
 coordination something that you fancy for 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.300
 give you a little bit of calorie burn 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.400
 extra and well we rest a minute and 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.050
 we would start the round again 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.180
 would be good training with 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.340
 do it about five or six 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.130
 I have made five rounds in this case 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.410
 It took me half an hour to do it and I 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.160
 I can take it for granted so nothing 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.750
 this has been the video of the week I've been 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.030
 a time without uploading too many videos 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.889
 It's a bit messy I hope it does not 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.120
 You know, I'm going to try to upload the 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.190
 maximum possible now that we are in 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.169
 I also want to raise many 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.240
 explanations that I have thought for 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.310
 example the next video that I have to 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.410
 I'm preparing, it's going to be the truth 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.199
 on the abs I hope that you 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.639
 like it and I hope you see it 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.500
 that you share if you liked the 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.760
 training and you try it now 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.720
 comment on the comments that you 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.340
 It seems 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.710
 any doubt you already know where to locate 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.210
 me and nothing a hug to all see you 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.830
 another day 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.830
 a fag enters the house 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.910
 you have to go through the gym 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.760
 I'm going to eat boys
