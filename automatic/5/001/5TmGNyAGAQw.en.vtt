00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.740 
there's off low medium and high right
there<00:00:38.989> reason<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> funny<00:00:40.649> design<00:00:41.129> is

there reason it's this funny design is
as<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.110> there's<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> rubber<00:00:44.210> bumpers

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
as you see there's like rubber bumpers

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
as you see there's like rubber bumpers
on<00:00:45.420> everything<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.829> course<00:00:47.010> its

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
on everything this is of course its

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
on everything this is of course its
normal<00:00:47.730> upright<00:00:47.879> position<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.110> put

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
normal upright position but you can put

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.389 
normal upright position but you can put
this<00:00:49.469> down<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.070> way<00:00:51.110> okay<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.280> if

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399

this down this way okay like that so if
you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> spot<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:55.399> an<00:00:56.399> area<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you have a spot here or an area on the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
you have a spot here or an area on the
floor<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> table

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
floor like if you have this on a table

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.569 
floor like if you have this on a table
like<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like that

like that
this<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.329> blow<00:01:00.539> downwards<00:01:01.079> toward<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> floor

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this can blow downwards toward the floor

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.509 
this can blow downwards toward the floor
to<00:01:02.670> dry<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.650> spillage<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.949> something

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
easy way for me to show you how much air

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
easy way for me to show you how much air
that<00:01:51.100> moves<00:01:51.550> but<00:01:51.910> you<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.240> listen<00:01:52.450> for<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
that moves but you can listen for the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.149 
that moves but you can listen for the
microphone<00:01:53.320> as<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> air<00:01:53.740> hits<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.800> that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
we'll come back to low on low this uses

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.650 
we'll come back to low on low this uses
about<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.780> hundred<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.230> four<00:02:18.410> watts<00:02:19.330> medium
