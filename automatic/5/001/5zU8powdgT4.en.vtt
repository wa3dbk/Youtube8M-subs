 such is unfounded and neither 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.300
 some validity probably origin 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.490
 of the name comes from the form of its 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.550
 round leaves that look like 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.760
 coins can also be because this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.490
 plant is very easy to care grows very 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.560
 fast and can also be reproduced from 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.670
 multiple ways as by cutting 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 division of plant and by seeds what 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.530
 It gives a certain feeling of abundance and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.010
 it can be related to wealth 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.990
 material however who knows like

 fortune and good luck 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.670
 with the money plant cared for the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.120
 money plant this plant is a 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 species in the flame family 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 native to south - east africa commonly 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.280
 cultivated as an indoor plant 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.800
 This plant stands out for how easy it is 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.110
 its reproduction since picking up a 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 cutting by putting it in water in a few days 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.269
 we will have a plant ready to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.239
 cultivate low- rise plant not 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.239
 greater than 30 centimeters with roots 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.549
 fibrous and light succulent branches 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.269
 and little prostrated centes or 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.090
 ascending these branches can be of 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.069
 greenish or purple color unlike 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 what may seem by its common name 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.810
 Swedish leader is not a climbing plant 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.390
 nor does it belong to the ivy family 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.970
 the money plant presents some 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.190
 tubular flowers ibi laviada are 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.019
 violet-colored roses have a 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.319
 delicate appearance but they are very 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.540
 resistant these flowers appear 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.050
 gathered in clusters since the middle of 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.050
 autumn until early winter 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.840
 the inflorescence are typical flowers of 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.360
 the labiated plants like rosemary or 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.310
 salvia light growing conditions 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.560
 rapid growth to half shadow is 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.990
 important that the plant receives light 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.390
 natural by placing it near windows or 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.970
 balconies when we have it indoors 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.590
 avoid in full sun because the exposure 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.510
 solar can burn its leaves moisture 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.110
 this plant needs a humid environment 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.500
 to develop does not tolerate drought 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.080
 the well-drained soil avoid excess 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.260
 water or soil floods 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.750
 warm weather temperatures with 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.030
 non-extreme cold seasons avoid 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.460
 exposure to temperatures below 5 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.700
 degrees average temperature not lower than 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.320
 15 degrees Celsius does not tolerate 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.350
 freezing so during the 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.299
 cold seasons it is recommended to enter 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.140
 the plants at home if you have them 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.090
 on the balcony or terrace the watering 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.310
 every two or three days at the stations 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.040
 warmer and weekly in winter 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.530
 It is important not to water every day because 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.280
 excess watering promotes diseases in 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.410
 the plant the fleshy leaves indicate us 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.740
 that it is not necessary to water too much 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.150
 plant 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.979
 if it does not bloom or has few flowers maybe 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.099
 agree to increase your solar exposure 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.190
 plants that receive little light are usually 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.289
 take time to bloom or flourish little if 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.199
 has spots on the leaves or has the 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.599
 discolored leaves is very common in 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.389
 this plant since it can be caused by 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.970
 an excess of watering space more the 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.160
 Watering period of the plant 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.780
 cuttings of the money plant are 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.240
 get plants with the same code 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.340
 Genetic cuttings can be cut 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.819
 at any time although it is preferable 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.860
 in spring or autumn the cuttings are 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.560
 Plant in pots or hanging baskets or 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.050
 on the ground shady place 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.310
 preferably to maintain humidity 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.949
 keep the soil slightly moist 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.530
 although not soaked with water during the 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.810
 first week of the transplant 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.120
 later the irrigation will be carried out more 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.460
 spaced avoiding the earth to 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.449
 dry keep in a warm place and with 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.180
