00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
coming across pianos in unexpected

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
places like this grand piano and I can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
places like this grand piano and I can
never<00:00:38.910> resist<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> clinking<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.530> little

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.790 
but I kind of like that anyway and this
color<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:33.570> much<00:05:33.690> of<00:05:33.780> association<00:05:34.560> with

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
like a logo it really does make sense to

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.680
