it all together for you and this way you

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.569 
it all together for you and this way you
can<00:02:18.090> pick<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.930> elements<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> want<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
can pick the elements you want and I

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.789 
can pick the elements you want and I
think<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.360> that's<00:02:21.660> probably<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
think that that that's probably the the

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.000 
think that that that's probably the the
most<00:02:23.900> exciting<00:02:24.900> thing<00:02:25.110> fenders<00:02:25.500> probably

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
most exciting thing fenders probably

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.630 
most exciting thing fenders probably
done<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.519> last<00:02:27.049> 2530<00:02:28.049> years<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.069> they

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
done in the last 2530 years and they

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.430 
done in the last 2530 years and they
built<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.030> lot<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> great<00:02:30.569> guitars<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.319> they've

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
built a lot of great guitars and they've

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.050 
built a lot of great guitars and they've

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
done a lot of great things but they've

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.110 
done a lot of great things but they've
never<00:02:33.390> made<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.170> possible<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:35.519> to
