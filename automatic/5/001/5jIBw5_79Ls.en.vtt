00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
come down I'm going to lightly dip my

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.619 
come down I'm going to lightly dip my
brush<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.989> edge<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> paint

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
brush into just the edge of the paint

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.030 
brush into just the edge of the paint
just<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> tip<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> brush<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
just get it on the tip of the brush and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.150 
just get it on the tip of the brush and
then<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> circular

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
then I'm going to this with a circular

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.510 
then I'm going to this with a circular
motion<00:00:48.530> offload<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:50.670> paint<00:00:55.070> sway<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
motion offload the paint sway I have the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.599 
motion offload the paint sway I have the
tip<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> brush<00:00:57.059> evenly<00:00:57.570> loaded<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> not

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
tip of the brush evenly loaded it's not

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
tip of the brush evenly loaded it's not
too<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.940> paint<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.739> ready<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
too much paint and you're ready to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.039 
too much paint and you're ready to
stencil

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.109 

okay<00:01:08.049> when<00:01:08.829> we<00:01:08.950> stencil<00:01:09.369> with<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> brush

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
okay when we stencil with a brush

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.480 
okay when we stencil with a brush
the<00:01:10.450> idea<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.409> stew<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.740> sweeping<00:01:12.280> motion

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
the idea is to stew a sweeping motion

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.940 
the idea is to stew a sweeping motion
towards<00:01:13.329> the<00:01:13.479> opening<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.140> stencil<00:01:14.439> you

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
towards the opening of the stencil you

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.889 
towards the opening of the stencil you
don't<00:01:15.250> want<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.610> sweep<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.060> brush<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
don't want to sweep the brush to the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.270 
don't want to sweep the brush to the
edge<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.289> the<00:01:17.409> stencil<00:01:17.619> you're<00:01:18.070> going<00:01:18.220> to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
edge of the stencil you're going to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.340 
edge of the stencil you're going to
force<00:01:18.549> paint<00:01:18.880> under<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.360> edge<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.810> get<00:01:20.020> bleed

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
force paint under the edge and get bleed

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.969 
force paint under the edge and get bleed
so<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.729> come<00:01:21.969> in<00:01:22.149> and<00:01:22.360> then<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.049> just<00:01:23.079> sweep

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
so you come in and then you just sweep

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:51.760 
so you come in and then you just sweep
in<00:01:24.280> towards<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.569> center

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.140 

okay<00:01:52.770> time<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> heart<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:53.940> going<00:01:53.970> to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the surface of the pain here then do a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.680 
the surface of the pain here then do a
circular<00:02:15.540> motion<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.580> evenly<00:02:18.060> distributes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690

just going to slightly offload that on
our<00:02:27.870> paper<00:02:28.110> towel<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.620> we're<00:02:28.890> ready<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.220> go

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
our paper towel so we're ready to go
here<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.330> stencil<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.230> want<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
here when you stencil this you want to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680 
here when you stencil this you want to
make<00:02:31.590> sure<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.250> bring<00:02:32.459> your<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:33.330> brush

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
make sure that you bring your your brush
into<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.320> opening<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> stencil<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
into the opening of the stencil and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.460 
into the opening of the stencil and
don't<00:02:35.820> work<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.600> push<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> paint

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.530 
don't work this way and push the paint
underneath<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.180> start<00:02:39.420> in
