is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.150> news<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> came<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.810> came<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.650> from

mainland China here in the last week or
two<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> set<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> tone

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
two I think that's going to set the tone

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.840 
two I think that's going to set the tone
of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.049> market<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
of the market and we all know that the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.080 
of the market and we all know that the
Chinese<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.320> very<00:01:34.560> bullish<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.979> gold<00:01:35.250> so

Chinese are very very bullish on gold so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
Chinese are very very bullish on gold so
you<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> might<00:01:36.840> help<00:01:37.110> propel<00:01:37.590> gold

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829

you think that might help propel gold
prices<00:01:38.070> off<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.030> possibly<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.600> yeah

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
