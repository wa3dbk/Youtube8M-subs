 [Music] 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 Baptists is so 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.480
 [Music] 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.730
 batista70phone friends here we come to 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.900
 one of the latest video reviews of roms 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.250
 on the galaxy s2 one of the last why 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.930
 because the press office requested me 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.300
 the sample and then on Sunday I'll see 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.059
 put it back closer 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.980
 possible to the original and then unfortunately 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.570
 our romantic story will end 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.749
 oh well then and ceo anyway always 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.480
 galaxy nexus is the note so there is no vi 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:48.019
 you will certainly get rid of this Roma then 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.460
 the former aurum is called version 7.2 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.949
 always based on the unofficial l pq 4.0.3 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.870
 what's special about the graphics 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.629
 which you see very beautiful for example here is 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.870
 the icon of the was placed on the blue 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.210
 beautiful messages also that of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.500
 whatsapp also the above part like 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.659
 we can see the stones are 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 really very very beautiful it goes well here 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 as usual to scroll that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 you can put how you want this is one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 is a constant that is being repeated in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.550
 many of the latest generation rom me 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.620
 I was saying what's special not to 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.210
 touch wiz when part 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:32.070
 you can select between nova lost 3 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.720
 buscÃ¨ good at fashions and fashions for the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 display beats audio mode which should 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.070
 be heard especially in listening 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 has been deactivated with earphones 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.860
 intelligently the speech of the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 incremental ringtone much thing 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 annoying and noise has been inserted 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.840
 reduction than to say now I am not there 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.600
 say the usual things about Rome 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 the browser works well you turn the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.550
 video camera function we can 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 make an experiment right away hoping to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.830
 don't be proven wrong 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.400
 let's see a fair video camera let's go to 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.000
 resume how we can see the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.880
 shooting was done and it was 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.440
 printed 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.060
 here it is let's make it start ok 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 videoplayer ok here was fi fi that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.130
 finished we eliminate because so much there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.470
 serves no purpose 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.990
 fm radio running unit 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.970
 working mass archive also 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.520
 that we can see as above 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.860
 however, I am really into it 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.740
 beautiful I like a lot but 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.540
 something blue-blue does not make me 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.750
 go crazy try well I have to say that it is 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 nice also how beautiful it is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.930
 the vague background of the contacts not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 found I tried to add e 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.870
 remove delete and others we have 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 inserted and not by any kind of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.060
 problem that say a rom for use 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.000
 newspaper not exceptional things is not 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.890
 one we say then can like it or not 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.230
 But the miui my inter least at 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.120
 the themes are something special 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.010
 and is practically almost one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.550
 total distortion of the system 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.650
 operational this is a solid rom 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.450
 stable did not create me any kind of 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.550
 problem and what not understood as never 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.380
 update here the market does not come 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.959
 out play ok so much then the end 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.080
 same thing we don't care I noticed 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.250
 I do not know if it is a case, however, noted a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.320
 increase from GPS to a location where 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.450
 sometimes it's hard to get it first 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.700
 learned now let's try here maybe here 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
 he will immediately hear me also because 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.799
 here in the kitchen 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.180
 let's say it's a little bit harder not 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.519
 let's show map now of course 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.160
 will surely find my address is 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.840
 the red gps but I assure you that first in 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.200
 a location of the house where 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.710
 generally struggling to take was 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.230
 managed to do the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.940
 the fix, however, is fine with everything 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.710
 earned outdoors the fix is 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.260
 practically immediate as you can 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:25.550
 see wifi we have full signal 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.860
 reception signal with vodafone in 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.240
 3g we can also say it here in phono 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.710
 then they are no less indicated as true 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.950
 try it mts so not 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.340
 we are not in gprs as it happened to me 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.470
 other times with other terminals than to say 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540
 let us not go further than I hope so 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.280
 be able to review from here on Sunday 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.990
 some other Rome as usual maybe 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.900
 recommended man and some noteworthy 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.450
 in the comments I can't prove them all 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.310
 also because I have another terminal in 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.140
 home to be tested so I don't tell you what it is 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.100
 and nothing I liked about it 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.080
 batista70phone to prof 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.510
