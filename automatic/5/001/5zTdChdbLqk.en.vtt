Irvine<00:00:28.699> well<00:00:30.320> why<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:32.250> show<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.739> two

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
Irvine well why don't I show you two

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.869 
Irvine well why don't I show you two
different<00:00:35.489> kinds<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.780> strokes<00:00:37.640> I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
different kinds of strokes I'm going to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.290 
different kinds of strokes I'm going to
move<00:00:39.030> closer<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.340> see

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
move closer so that you can really see

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
move closer so that you can really see
this<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.670> TA<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.950> second

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this the first is so TA and the second

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
this the first is so TA and the second
is<00:00:50.820> piccata<00:00:57.320> now<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> TA<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.829> French<00:01:02.129> word

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is piccata now so TA is a French word

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.870 
is piccata now so TA is a French word
and<00:01:02.640> salt<00:01:03.030> means<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.799> jump<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> difference

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and salt means to jump the difference

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.630 
and salt means to jump the difference
between<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.960> TA<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.689> spicata<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
between so TA and spicata is that in so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.010 
between so TA and spicata is that in so
ta<00:01:15.590> it's<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.270> bow<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:21.299> bounces<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.710> jumps<00:01:23.369> in

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
ta it's the bow that bounces or jumps in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.390 
ta it's the bow that bounces or jumps in
spicata

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
spicata

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.899 
spicata
it's<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.210> hair<00:01:27.770> that's<00:01:28.770> bouncing<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's the hair that's bouncing on the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.499 
it's the hair that's bouncing on the
string<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.320> suti<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> stroke<00:01:35.509> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
string so you see in a suti a stroke it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
string so you see in a suti a stroke it
would<00:01:36.780> mean<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:39.390> bow<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> hair<00:01:41.549> other

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
would mean that the bow the hair other

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.639 
would mean that the bow the hair other
is<00:01:42.350> sting<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> string<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.329> bow<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
is sting on the string and the bow is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.240 
is sting on the string and the bow is
bouncing<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:50.479> spicata<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
bouncing up and down and in spicata it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.459 
bouncing up and down and in spicata it
literally<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:54.110> bouncing<00:01:55.790> okay

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
literally is bouncing okay

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.620 
literally is bouncing okay
for<00:01:58.469> example

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
for example

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
for example
there<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> Mozart<00:02:02.340> Chrysler<00:02:04.369> piece<00:02:05.369> which

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
there is a Mozart Chrysler piece which

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
there is a Mozart Chrysler piece which
is<00:02:06.390> coal<00:02:06.689> Rondo<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.179> piece<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:10.410> goes

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is coal Rondo and in this piece it goes

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:20.600 
is coal Rondo and in this piece it goes
very<00:02:11.160> quickly<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:16.010> stroke<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.989> ta<00:02:19.610> again

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
very quickly this stroke is so ta again

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.699 
very quickly this stroke is so ta again
the<00:02:21.360> hair<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:23.000> not<00:02:24.050> leaving<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.410> string<00:02:27.709> but

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the hair is not leaving the string but

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.870 
the hair is not leaving the string but
the<00:02:28.770> blow<00:02:29.390> itself<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.690> wood<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.730> bouncing<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the blow itself the wood is bouncing and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.050 
the blow itself the wood is bouncing and
that<00:02:33.420> makes<00:02:33.810> us<00:02:34.050> allows<00:02:34.650> us<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:35.760> very

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that makes us allows us to go very

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.110 
that makes us allows us to go very
quickly<00:02:39.200> if<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.739> piccalo<00:02:42.739> well<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:44.400> cannot

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
quickly if it's piccalo well we cannot

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.440 
quickly if it's piccalo well we cannot
go<00:02:47.300> as<00:02:48.300> quickly<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:50.100> two<00:02:50.450> specific

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
go as quickly so these are two specific

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.800 
go as quickly so these are two specific
strokes<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:53.790> used<00:02:54.319> with<00:02:55.319> LeBeau<00:02:56.480> all<00:02:57.480> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
strokes that are used with LeBeau all of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.180 
strokes that are used with LeBeau all of
this<00:02:58.370> begs<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.730> my<00:03:00.209> opinion<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:02.310> further

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
this begs in my opinion a little further

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.620 
this begs in my opinion a little further
discovery<00:03:05.190> for<00:03:05.489> example<00:03:06.000> well<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.640> how<00:03:08.640> do

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
discovery for example well then how do

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.520 
discovery for example well then how do
you<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.790> bow<00:03:12.209> grip<00:03:13.610> allow<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:15.530> Sotiris

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you with your bow grip allow a Sotiris

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.479 
you with your bow grip allow a Sotiris
picado<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:18.049> well<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.579> remember<00:03:20.579> in<00:03:21.090> France

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
picado to be well I remember in France

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.180 
picado to be well I remember in France
speaking<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.970> some<00:03:24.600> Russian<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.709> Russian

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
speaking with some Russian a Russian

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.090 
speaking with some Russian a Russian
colleague<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:27.750> had<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> long<00:03:28.440> discussion<00:03:28.650> about

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
colleague we had a long discussion about

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.460 
colleague we had a long discussion about
this<00:03:29.459> because<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.959> fact<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.019> bow<00:03:34.200> there

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
this because in fact with the bow there

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.380 
this because in fact with the bow there
are<00:03:34.560> certain<00:03:34.859> pressure<00:03:35.340> points<00:03:36.000> which<00:03:36.209> are

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
are certain pressure points which are

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.060 
are certain pressure points which are
very<00:03:36.780> very<00:03:37.340> important<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:39.170> producing<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.920> bow

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
very very important to producing the bow

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.570 
very very important to producing the bow
strokes<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.640> we<00:03:41.820> use<00:03:43.280> for<00:03:44.280> example

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
strokes that we use for example

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.600 
strokes that we use for example
if<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:47.620> use<00:03:48.620> my<00:03:51.910> index<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.330> my<00:03:53.870> third<00:03:54.590> finger<00:03:55.100> as

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
if I use my index and my third finger as

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.720 
if I use my index and my third finger as
a<00:03:57.250> pressure<00:03:58.570> point<00:03:59.570> in<00:04:00.290> no<00:04:00.710> squeezing<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.580> a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
a pressure point in no squeezing just a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.330 
a pressure point in no squeezing just a
pressure<00:04:02.300> point<00:04:03.550> this<00:04:04.550> produces<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:07.070> you'll

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
pressure point this produces and you'll

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.480 
pressure point this produces and you'll
see<00:04:07.610> some<00:04:07.910> Slavs<00:04:08.360> in<00:04:08.780> fact<00:04:09.110> who<00:04:09.770> play<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.220> way

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490
