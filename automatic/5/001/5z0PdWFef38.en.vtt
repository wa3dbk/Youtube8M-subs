00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.990
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.990
 bonsai video 0 palmat um 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.920
 Welcome to a new bonsai video 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.529
 it will be palm is on the other day yesterday 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.090
 precisely without going any further yesterday I did 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.110
 an update video of many 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.070
 jobs that we have to do from 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.960
 samurai of I plunged in and it's no longer me 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 agreement plus many things many things 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.500
 what did someone tell me you missed 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.190
 the update of bonsai be or palmat 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.109
 a job 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 that 's right there are zero palms you do not 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.149
 you know that after folia that the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.390
 mistreat the two many still 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.390
 if not 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.290
 bits of all good because this is the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290
 result of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.390
 palmat one of the defoliator that tells you 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.340
 before we had a sheet one sheet one 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.780
 leaf a sheet and now we have the output 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.960
 of a new branch new branch 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.960
 obviously the benefits are 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.610
 incalculable where before we had to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 make an apex surely of the sap 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.070
 a sacrifice branch that had happened to them 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.470
 to invent because I wanted to do the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.240
 interesting a sacrificial branch for 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 hang the tree that right now is like 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 nothing and then this branch 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 surely wants to demonstrate the world of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.159
 trunk we will let the realization strip 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.380
 towards the sides pull towards the dates 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 to the sides and here the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.650
 true magic of our design 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.060
 acepar killed and the kid 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.490
 you have to txiki rating and link 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.180
 it's slower 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 But look 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.930
 here 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.080
 look where are you getting an outbreak 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.290
 goes a little to his ball the truth but is 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.290
 sprouting 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.080
 look 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.810
 the big one 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.560
 you see 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.630
 with this wonderful beige red background 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.450
 all these are new branches not leaves 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.040
 beige this is an outbreak 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.099
 and this bud is going to eat has a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 branch this outbreak is going to turn into a 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.410
 branch this outbreak is going to turn into a 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.620
 branch and so we will organize a lot 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 our soul the interesting thing about art 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.390
 for the bully is wired when he is 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.280
 so young and tender 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.380
 good trans and young and tender because it is 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.120
 malleable and allows us to move 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.410
 if we do not wait for it to be thicker and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 which means for example how is 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.160
 for work is not going to put a little 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 harder and when I say a little bit I'm 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.860
 being very generous because it is already like this 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.270
 is this update of my bonsai 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.210
 zero calm your world 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.600
 the little one the little one is here in the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.520
 cut that I gave him when our doing 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.590
 for the bully removes sap we see that goes 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.610
 putting that black part then if 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.590
 we believe that there are parts that are put 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.640
 black bad in this case with right to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220
 the two cuts has been put a little 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.480
 in black the lip because it removes sap 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.530
 but fortunately it is sprouting for 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.910
 down and I will not have to 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.920
 everything is fine very well and well and it is already 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.050

 we like a picture is not prettier 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.049
 for others as it finances them towards 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.049
 down so that this anguish 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.509
 the air compressor 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.509
 good 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.830

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.540
