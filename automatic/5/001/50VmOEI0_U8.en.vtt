 young aboriginals will also require 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.189
 everywhere it's good to do it for sure 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.470
 is not done at home I do not know 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.119
 not to piss off the victorious general 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 who was convincing butterfly so yes 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.260
 before his death in 1981 in honor of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.219
 which British prime minister and who 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.219
 liked this crime a lot 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:53.320

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.680
 I was beautiful as the end of a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 trash the small incomes do not have to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.450
 to be here I think he would not feel 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 not comfortable in our universe there 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.539
 would do the job and put people down 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.220
 can not afford to be here 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.530
 will see a lot of high income 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.190
 naturally some say that these 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.140
 snobs 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 but I will tell you the truth and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.380
 it's very very posh on the other side 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.140
 with a secret as hard to hide it's 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.149
 what coins seized do not believe 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.020
 all written 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.220
 no but it is because at home 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.360
 clumsy they do not believe they believe 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 not everything he does not think it was too much 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 ap 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.729
 and then who to believe then I you 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.410
 do not believe it , we believe in it 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.330
 what we do not say often enough is 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.689
 that banana is actually an open a 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.460
 containing unfertilized eggs then 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.720
 domestic banana it happen again 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.579
 not thanks to seeds but by 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.320
 roger from his roots so the 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.909
 banana eggs are never 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.290
 fertilized and bananas are two sheep 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.990
 Japanese people have come together 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.729
 longtime friends not at all because 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.300
 spent together chatting 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.920
 oblivion is a friend to rent 40 euros from 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.850
 time is the price of friendship at 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.020
 Japan always punished him then you 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.610

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.480

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.070
