00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:18.859
 the electronic battery ignition system 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.859
 consists of poland rotor sensor 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:34.279
 control part ignition coil ignition cable and stÃ¶hr 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.279
 plug and spark plug 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.700
 to test these components are suitable 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 walt meter as well as electronic voltage 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.470
 or continuous powder 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.600
 before a test or error search 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.060
 Sensor and control part is performed 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.130
 must be guaranteed that no 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.690
 defects in components of the electrical 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.690
 plant of the vehicle preferences 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:14.990
 In particular, these are cables and their 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:20.930
 Connections the vehicle battery 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:24.430
 Ignition coil the ignition cable and stub plug 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.430
 and the spark plug 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.799
 before checking the unit 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 the green wire on the connection 1 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 to set up the ignition coil for occupational safety 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 disconnected 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.009
 the test instrument a klimmer 31 g 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.610
 as well as terminal 7 connect ignition 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.610
 turn on 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 hex with an internal connections which 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.740
 crankshaft in motor direction of rotation 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740
 go berserk 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:23.200
 im in time are a tension of 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:25.150
 about 4 5 volts and after a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.769
 half crankshaft revolutions again 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.769
 fall to 0 volts 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.359
 this is not the case will be the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 Connection of terminal 15 g of the sensor 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:43.200
 subtracted and with a connection of the 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.419
 Test connected by means 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.870
 the second connection remains at the terminal 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:52.389
 31 g of the sensor when switched on 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.620
 Ignition must constantly be about 12 volts 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.620
 food voltage applied 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.940
 are these 12 volts but the signal 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.550
 from about 4 5 volts to terminal 7 of the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.900
 Sensors is missing the unit 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.700
 defective in the absence of 12 volt food 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 voltage, the control part is defective 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.140
 a connection of the test agent tan 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.090
 Connect terminal 15 of the ignition coil 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.160
 in other connection with the already of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.820
 the ignition coil clarified green 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.820
 connecting lines 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.630
 Switch on ignition 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.410
 when turning the crankshaft must in 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.620
 Ignition time, the voltage to 0 volts 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.320
 fall off and after about 180 degrees 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.700
 crankshaft revolutions back to about 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.700
 12 volts rise 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.450
 if this is not the case, the tax is 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.450
 partly defective 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.340
 a repair of the sensor or the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.630
 city part is not provided 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.360
 at the examination of said 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.160
 defective assemblies is highlighted 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.949
 the relevant assembly against a 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.539
 exchange new ones 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.500
 only original spare parts may be used 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.330
 used by the manufacturer 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.490
 otherwise, a proper 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.039
 operation of the entire electronic 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.220
 batteries ignition system not guaranteed 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.220
