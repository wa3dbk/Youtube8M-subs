00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.500 
we learned that all the brothers have
the<00:03:01.960> same<00:03:02.260> father<00:03:02.710> but<00:03:03.130> they<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:04.030> different

Reggie probably had to do a lot of the
stuff<00:05:20.370> growing<00:05:20.670> up<00:05:20.940> because<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.510> know<00:05:21.600> shoe

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
stuff growing up because you know shoe

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.780
