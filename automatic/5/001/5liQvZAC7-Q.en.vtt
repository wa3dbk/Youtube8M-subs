let's<00:00:23.010> draw<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> number<00:00:23.400> line<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
let's draw a number line here just to

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.529 
let's draw a number line here just to
help<00:00:24.449> us<00:00:24.830> visualize<00:00:25.830> what's<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.330> let

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
help us visualize what's going on so let

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
help us visualize what's going on so let
me<00:00:27.689> draw<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:29.340> even<00:00:29.640> though<00:00:29.789> once<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> get

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
me draw and even though once you get

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.519 
me draw and even though once you get
enough<00:00:30.420> practice<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.019> won't<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> draw

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
enough practice you won't have to draw

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
enough practice you won't have to draw
these<00:00:31.710> number<00:00:32.040> lines<00:00:32.219> anymore<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.730> least<00:00:32.790> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
these number lines anymore at least for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.430 
these number lines anymore at least for
me<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> find<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> helpful<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.290> least

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
me I find it helpful to at least

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
me I find it helpful to at least
visualize<00:00:34.890> him<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.309> brain<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:36.300> I'm

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
visualize him in my brain when I'm

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
visualize him in my brain when I'm
adding<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.899> subtracting<00:00:37.290> negative<00:00:37.559> numbers

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
adding and subtracting negative numbers

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.209 
adding and subtracting negative numbers
so<00:00:38.370> he<00:00:38.879> starts<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.360> negative<00:00:40.010> $15.08<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.129> his

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
so he starts with negative $15.08 in his

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.600 
so he starts with negative $15.08 in his
mouth<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> zero<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:43.710> zero<00:00:43.980> over

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
mouth so this is zero that's zero over

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250 
mouth so this is zero that's zero over
there<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.300> starts<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> negative<00:00:46.020> number

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there he starts with a negative number

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
there he starts with a negative number
let<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.920> let<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
let me do that in let me do that in a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
let me do that in let me do that in a
reddish<00:00:48.690> color<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.230> show<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.890> know

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
reddish color to show that it's you know

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
reddish color to show that it's you know
he's<00:00:50.190> overdrawn<00:00:50.850> his<00:00:51.120> balance<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:51.930> starts

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
he's overdrawn his balance so he starts

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
he's overdrawn his balance so he starts
with<00:00:52.440> negative<00:00:53.399> fifteen<00:00:53.789> dollars<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> eight

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
with negative fifteen dollars and eight

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
with negative fifteen dollars and eight
cents<00:00:54.780> negative<00:00:55.410> fifteen<00:00:55.829> dollars<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> eight

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
cents negative fifteen dollars and eight

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.830 
cents negative fifteen dollars and eight
cents<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.079> he's<00:00:58.260> 15<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> eight<00:00:59.910> hundredths<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
cents so he's 15 and eight hundredths to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.240 
cents so he's 15 and eight hundredths to
the<00:01:01.199> left<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.829> zero<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.739> length<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the left of zero so this the length of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
the left of zero so this the length of
this<00:01:05.339> arrow<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> absolute<00:01:06.510> value<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
this arrow is the absolute value of this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
this arrow is the absolute value of this
which<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> 15<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.220> eight<00:01:08.970> hundredths<00:01:09.540> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
which is 15 and eight hundredths so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.770 
which is 15 and eight hundredths so
that's<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.439> length<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.780> now

be<00:01:34.770> able<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> draw<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.100> completely<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> scale

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
be able to draw it completely to scale

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
be able to draw it completely to scale
but<00:01:36.750> hopefully<00:01:37.140> it'll<00:01:37.409> give<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> right

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

idea so we're adding four hundred twenty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.999 
idea so we're adding four hundred twenty
six<00:01:40.740> dollars<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> length<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
six dollars to it so the length of this

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
six dollars to it so the length of this

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
if you look at it here we can just think

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.940 
if you look at it here we can just think
about<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.299> visually<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.229> amount<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.590> he<00:02:04.770> has

about it visually the amount that he has

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.100 
about it visually the amount that he has
left<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> length<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
length of the orange arrow so this over

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:51.090 
length of the orange arrow so this over
here<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.350> be<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:48.519> 426

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
here is going to be it's going to be 426

426 I'm having trouble writing numbers
420<00:02:54.680> 690<00:02:55.580> that's<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.540> length<00:02:56.810> minus<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950

length of the orange I remember the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.580 
length of the orange I remember the
length<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.959> orange<00:03:00.170> are<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
length of the orange are just the

lengths it's just going to be 15 minus
15<00:03:05.290> let<00:03:06.290> me<00:03:06.380> write<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.560> here<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:08.090> minus<00:03:12.370> $15.08

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
15 let me write it here so minus $15.08

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.090 
15 let me write it here so minus $15.08
and<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.780> going<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.110> be<00:03:15.380> equal<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
and so this is going to be equal to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.849 
and so this is going to be equal to
let's<00:03:16.609> see<00:03:16.700> we<00:03:17.390> can<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:17.959> will<00:03:18.140> become<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.590> 10

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
let's see we can this will become a 10

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.750 
let's see we can this will become a 10
this<00:03:19.100> becomes<00:03:19.549> an<00:03:19.820> 8<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.930> 10<00:03:21.200> minus<00:03:21.530> 8<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.950> 2<00:03:22.400> 8

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
this becomes an 8 so 10 minus 8 is 2 8

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.090 
this becomes an 8 so 10 minus 8 is 2 8
minus<00:03:23.180> 0<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.540> 8<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:24.200> have<00:03:24.230> lined<00:03:24.739> up<00:03:24.890> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
minus 0 is 8 we have lined up the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.060 
minus 0 is 8 we have lined up the
decimal<00:03:25.430> point<00:03:25.670> 6<00:03:26.090> minus<00:03:26.390> 1<00:03:26.570> is<00:03:26.750> 6<00:03:27.500> minus<00:03:27.829> 5<00:03:28.010> is

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
decimal point 6 minus 1 is 6 minus 5 is

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.620 
decimal point 6 minus 1 is 6 minus 5 is
1<00:03:28.370> 2<00:03:29.060> minus<00:03:29.450> 1<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.959> 1<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.070> 4<00:03:31.700> -<00:03:32.030> nothing<00:03:32.420> is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
1 2 minus 1 is 1 and then 4 - nothing is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.400 
1 2 minus 1 is 1 and then 4 - nothing is
4<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.709> right<00:03:33.950> here<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.880> are<00:03:34.910> at<00:03:35.410> 411

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
4 so this right here we are at 411

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.319 
4 so this right here we are at 411
dollars<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:37.010> 82<00:03:37.250> cents<00:03:37.700> that's<00:03:37.820> how<00:03:38.000> much<00:03:38.150> he

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
dollars and 82 cents that's how much he

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.660 
dollars and 82 cents that's how much he
had<00:03:38.570> that's<00:03:39.260> how<00:03:39.380> much<00:03:39.530> he<00:03:39.680> had<00:03:39.799> after<00:03:40.370> Monday

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
had that's how much he had after Monday

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.830 
had that's how much he had after Monday
another<00:03:40.880> way<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.120> think<00:03:41.299> about<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.720> those

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
another way to think about it is those

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.050 
another way to think about it is those
400<00:03:42.459> $26.90<00:03:43.459> plus<00:03:44.269> negative<00:03:45.880> $15.08

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
400 $26.90 plus negative $15.08

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.660 
400 $26.90 plus negative $15.08
if<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.019> think<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.410> way<00:03:48.680> adding<00:03:49.579> a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
if you think of it that way adding a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.890 
if you think of it that way adding a
negative<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.209> same<00:03:50.239> thing<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.780> just

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
negative is the same thing as just

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.590 
negative is the same thing as just
subtracting<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.799> positive<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.519> 420<00:03:52.910> 690

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
subtracting the positive so it's 420 690

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.020 
subtracting the positive so it's 420 690
-<00:03:54.049> 1508<00:03:54.680> but<00:03:54.890> hopefully<00:03:55.190> these<00:03:55.370> arrows<00:03:55.819> give

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
- 1508 but hopefully these arrows give

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.220 
- 1508 but hopefully these arrows give
you<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.299> visualization<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:57.019> what's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
you a good visualization of what's

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.840 
you a good visualization of what's
happening<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.100> that's<00:03:58.280> where<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.489> are<00:03:58.640> for

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
happening so that's where we are for

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.729 
happening so that's where we are for
Monday<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.390> then<00:03:59.810> he<00:03:59.900> deposits<00:04:00.350> another

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
Monday and then he deposits another

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.789 
Monday and then he deposits another
cheque<00:04:01.069> he<00:04:01.910> deposits<00:04:02.600> another<00:04:03.019> check<00:04:03.470> for

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
cheque he deposits another check for

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.780 
cheque he deposits another check for
$100<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.569> we're<00:04:05.720> gonna<00:04:05.810> go<00:04:06.109> from<00:04:06.400> 411<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.489> 82

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
$100 so we're gonna go from 411 and 82

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.120 
$100 so we're gonna go from 411 and 82
and<00:04:07.940> we're<00:04:08.030> gonna<00:04:08.120> add<00:04:08.359> another<00:04:08.569> 100<00:04:09.130> we're

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and we're gonna add another 100 we're

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.610 
and we're gonna add another 100 we're
going<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.459> add<00:04:10.579> another<00:04:11.329> hundred<00:04:11.690> dollars<00:04:12.230> to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
going to add another hundred dollars to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.210 
going to add another hundred dollars to
that<00:04:12.940> we're<00:04:13.940> going<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.239> add<00:04:14.359> another<00:04:15.220> another

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
that we're going to add another another

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.830 
that we're going to add another another
hundred<00:04:16.669> dollars<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:17.450> that's<00:04:17.630> pretty

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
hundred dollars and so that's pretty

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.289 
hundred dollars and so that's pretty
straightforward<00:04:17.989> we're<00:04:18.919> at<00:04:19.039> 411<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:19.940> 82

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
straightforward we're at 411 and 82

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.899 
straightforward we're at 411 and 82
we're<00:04:20.840> gonna<00:04:20.959> add<00:04:21.169> another<00:04:21.320> hundred<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.220> so

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
we're gonna add another hundred to it so

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.960 
we're gonna add another hundred to it so
plus<00:04:23.440> 100<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:25.159> is<00:04:25.370> going<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.669> be

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
plus 100 this is going to be

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.450 
plus 100 this is going to be
511<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:28.810> $82<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:30.140> how<00:04:30.470> much<00:04:30.620> he<00:04:30.740> has<00:04:30.860> after<00:04:31.190> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
511 and $82 is how much he has after the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.660 
511 and $82 is how much he has after the
second<00:04:31.940> deposit
