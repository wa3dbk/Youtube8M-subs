some desert camouflage this could go on
anything<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> tank<00:00:12.120> haul<00:00:12.300> or<00:00:12.690> maybe<00:00:12.900> some

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
anything like a tank haul or maybe some

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
anything like a tank haul or maybe some
spaceman<00:00:13.440> armor<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.429> first<00:00:14.610> thing<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> did

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
spaceman armor so the first thing I did

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.670 
spaceman armor so the first thing I did
was<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.059> took<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.269> dark<00:00:15.900> brown<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.470> made

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
was I took some dark brown and I made

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.840 
was I took some dark brown and I made
some<00:00:17.010> small<00:00:17.220> streaks<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:19.220> put<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.369> fairly

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
some small streaks I put some fairly

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.970 
some small streaks I put some fairly
even<00:00:21.180> distance<00:00:21.480> from<00:00:21.600> each<00:00:21.750> other<00:00:24.769> then<00:00:25.769> moved

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
even distance from each other then moved

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.000 
even distance from each other then moved
on<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> lighter<00:00:27.390> brown<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.900> placed<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.740> on

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
on to a lighter brown I placed that on

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.530 
on to a lighter brown I placed that on
one<00:00:29.939> side<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> dark<00:00:30.689> streak<00:00:35.420> make<00:00:36.420> sure

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
one side of the dark streak make sure

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
one side of the dark streak make sure
that<00:00:36.630> these<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.899> fairly<00:00:37.079> random<00:00:37.469> -<00:00:37.640> some

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that these are fairly random - some

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.080 
that these are fairly random - some
bigger<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.030> smaller

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.210 

and<00:00:49.570> then<00:00:49.690> apply<00:00:49.900> it<00:00:49.960> another<00:00:50.560> streak<00:00:51.010> of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
and then apply it another streak of

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.140 
and then apply it another streak of
light<00:00:52.060> tan<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:53.490> made<00:00:54.490> sure<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.790> was<00:00:54.850> the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
light tan I made sure this was the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.670 
light tan I made sure this was the
largest<00:00:55.420> patch<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:57.990> also<00:00:58.990> keep<00:00:59.170> in<00:00:59.290> mind<00:00:59.320> to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
largest patch and also keep in mind to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
largest patch and also keep in mind to
bunch<00:01:00.100> up<00:01:00.280> all<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.610> these<00:01:00.760> colors

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.419 

I<00:01:18.149> then<00:01:19.140> went<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.679> dark-brown<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
I then went back with a dark-brown and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.789 
I then went back with a dark-brown and
helps<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> make<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> original<00:01:22.289> colors<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
helps to make the original colors a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.099 
helps to make the original colors a
little<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.280> abstract<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
little bit more abstract and then I

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.469 
little bit more abstract and then I
began<00:01:25.469> applying<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.189> small<00:01:26.909> dots<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
began applying some small dots and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.809 
began applying some small dots and
specks<00:01:27.719> which<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:28.710> complete<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.549> camel

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
specks which will complete the the camel

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.450 
specks which will complete the the camel
scheme

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.489 

as<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.759> see<00:01:33.909> there<00:01:34.090> I've<00:01:34.240> had<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.810> plenty

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
as you can see there I've had a plenty

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.510 
as you can see there I've had a plenty
of<00:01:35.590> them<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.929> went<00:01:38.049> on<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.499> add<00:01:38.950> some

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
of them and then I went on to add some

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.279 
of them and then I went on to add some
white<00:01:39.759> dots<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.359> inside<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.079> brown

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
white dots to the inside of the brown

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.080 
white dots to the inside of the brown
leaving<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.340> little<00:01:42.460> bit<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.759> dark<00:01:42.969> brown

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
leaving a little bit of the dark brown

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.569 
leaving a little bit of the dark brown
showing<00:01:43.569> now<00:01:44.469> I<00:01:44.500> use<00:01:44.709> a<00:01:44.740> darker<00:01:45.159> Brown<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.549> I

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
showing now I use a darker Brown that I

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.059 
showing now I use a darker Brown that I
had<00:01:45.850> with<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.090> original<00:01:46.149> Brown<00:01:46.749> speaks<00:01:47.109> so

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
had with the original Brown speaks so

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.559 
had with the original Brown speaks so
keep<00:01:48.219> that<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.399> mind<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.179> I'm<00:01:49.270> using<00:01:49.329> a

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
keep that in mind and then I'm using a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.709 
keep that in mind and then I'm using a
white<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.500> dot<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:51.640> place<00:01:51.819> a<00:01:51.849> dot<00:01:52.119> on<00:01:52.270> each<00:01:52.539> of

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
white to dot to place a dot on each of

00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:01.370 
white to dot to place a dot on each of
the<00:01:52.840> little<00:01:53.349> specks

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 

I<00:02:01.439> wasn't<00:02:02.130> completely<00:02:02.340> happy<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
I wasn't completely happy with the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.179 
I wasn't completely happy with the
number<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.659> specs<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.409> down<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:04.950> adding

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
number of specs I put down so I'm adding

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.380 
number of specs I put down so I'm adding
a<00:02:05.310> few<00:02:05.460> more<00:02:10.760> again<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.880> finished<00:02:12.150> off<00:02:12.269> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
a few more again I finished off the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.839 
a few more again I finished off the
specs<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> white<00:02:13.500> dot<00:02:13.950> paint<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> middle

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
specs with a white dot paint the middle

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.430 
specs with a white dot paint the middle
leaving<00:02:15.300> plenty<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> brown<00:02:16.200> behind<00:02:21.440> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
leaving plenty of the brown behind and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.330
