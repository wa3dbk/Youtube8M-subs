like he'll just talk shit on that all
the<00:00:48.550> time<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:49.090> I<00:00:49.329> think<00:00:49.510> it's<00:00:49.629> mainly<00:00:49.840> just

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
the time and I think it's mainly just

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.259 
the time and I think it's mainly just
because<00:00:50.379> like<00:00:50.890> as<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.250> cuss<00:00:51.550> word<00:00:51.579> in<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.090> and

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
because like as a cuss word in it and

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.029 
because like as a cuss word in it and
even<00:00:52.989> though<00:00:53.050> it<00:00:53.140> bleeps<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.500> out<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:53.769> still

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
even though it bleeps it out I still

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.189 
even though it bleeps it out I still
think<00:00:54.250> he<00:00:54.370> just<00:00:54.519> doesn't<00:00:54.789> like<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.329> don't

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
think he just doesn't like that I don't

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.520 
think he just doesn't like that I don't
know<00:00:56.289> how<00:00:56.350> fancy<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.219> pansy<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.379> um

or<00:03:33.810> at<00:03:33.959> least<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.350> what<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.500> think<00:03:34.769> because

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
or at least this is what I think because

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.890 
or at least this is what I think because
when<00:03:36.299> i<00:03:36.329> record<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.260> my<00:03:37.500> HD<00:03:37.890> PVR<00:03:38.100> right<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
when i record on my HD PVR right in the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.960 
when i record on my HD PVR right in the
would<00:03:40.290> i<00:03:40.350> look<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> properties<00:03:41.220> like

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
would i look at the properties like

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.020 
would i look at the properties like
after<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.600> says<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.620> every<00:03:44.250> cod<00:03:44.489> game<00:03:44.820> other

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
after it says on every cod game other

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.300 
after it says on every cod game other
than<00:03:45.120> black<00:03:45.299> ops<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.840> says<00:03:46.049> 60<00:03:47.010> frames<00:03:47.220> per

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
than black ops and says 60 frames per

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.610 
than black ops and says 60 frames per
second<00:03:47.730> black<00:03:47.940> ops<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.600> says<00:03:48.810> 30<00:03:49.260> frames<00:03:49.560> per

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
second black ops this says 30 frames per

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.190 
second black ops this says 30 frames per
second<00:03:50.100> like<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.360> i<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:51.690> know<00:03:51.810> that's<00:03:51.989> why

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
second like so i don't know that's why

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.020 
second like so i don't know that's why
i'm<00:03:52.290> thinking<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.829> know<00:03:53.130> black<00:03:53.310> ops<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.700> 30

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
i'm thinking is you know black ops is 30

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.570 
i'm thinking is you know black ops is 30
frames<00:03:54.360> which

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
frames which

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.510 
frames which
makes<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.330> not<00:03:57.450> run<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.780> smooth<00:03:58.020> yeah<00:03:58.710> yeah

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
makes it not run as smooth yeah yeah

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.130 
makes it not run as smooth yeah yeah
that's<00:03:59.760> probably<00:04:00.210> right<00:04:00.480> here<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> go<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
that's probably right here you go on a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.320 
that's probably right here you go on a
pretty<00:04:01.440> good<00:04:01.650> ter<00:04:01.890> you're<00:04:02.070> gonna<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.460> 120

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
when you get like 30 kills in a regular

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.980 
when you get like 30 kills in a regular
TDM<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.380> cod4<00:04:10.650> that's<00:04:11.100> pretty<00:04:11.670> damn<00:04:11.910> good<00:04:12.210> you

people even you how do you get a kill a
second<00:04:25.650> chance<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.040> cod4<00:04:26.460> like<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.790> don't<00:04:26.850> even

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
second chance and cod4 like I don't even

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.090 
second chance and cod4 like I don't even
know<00:04:27.210> why<00:04:27.330> people<00:04:27.630> use<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:27.990> my<00:04:28.620> cuz<00:04:28.830> they're

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
know why people use as my cuz they're

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.490 
know why people use as my cuz they're
from<00:04:29.250> black<00:04:29.460> ops<00:04:29.700> yeah<00:04:30.300> prolly<00:04:30.690> or<00:04:31.050> or<00:04:31.320> like

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
from black ops yeah prolly or or like

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.440 
from black ops yeah prolly or or like
Mona<00:04:32.130> for<00:04:32.400> two<00:04:32.580> since<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.000> could<00:04:33.180> use<00:04:33.420> like

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
Mona for two since you could use like

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.800 
Mona for two since you could use like
you<00:04:34.020> could<00:04:34.170> like<00:04:35.360> maybe<00:04:36.360> they're<00:04:36.600> useful

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
you could like maybe they're useful

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.390 
you could like maybe they're useful
using<00:04:37.170> final<00:04:37.470> stand<00:04:37.710> there<00:04:37.890> like<00:04:38.040> oh<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
using final stand there like oh it's the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.640 
using final stand there like oh it's the
same<00:04:38.580> thing<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:39.180> can<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.810> know<00:04:39.900> use<00:04:40.110> my<00:04:40.230> primary

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
same thing I can you know use my primary

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.820 
same thing I can you know use my primary
gun<00:04:41.600> when<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.630> play<00:04:42.840> black<00:04:43.050> ops<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.440> think<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
gun when I play black ops I think the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.930 
gun when I play black ops I think the
reason<00:04:43.980> why<00:04:44.190> there's<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.430> many<00:04:44.490> people<00:04:44.760> use

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
reason why there's so many people use

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.700 
reason why there's so many people use
second<00:04:45.270> chances<00:04:45.660> because<00:04:45.930> it's<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.320> one<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
second chances because it's in one the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.950 
second chances because it's in one the
very<00:04:46.860> first<00:04:47.130> class<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.610> use<00:04:47.820> with<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.300> m16

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
very first class you use with the m16

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.380 
very first class you use with the m16
yeah<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.920> they<00:04:50.460> probably<00:04:50.490> get<00:04:50.820> like<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:51.030> couple

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
yeah and they probably get like a couple

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.520 
yeah and they probably get like a couple
kills<00:04:51.600> out<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.990> they're<00:04:52.140> like<00:04:52.290> oh<00:04:52.410> this

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
kills out of that they're like oh this

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.170 
kills out of that they're like oh this
look<00:04:52.740> there's<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.160> pretty<00:04:53.340> nice<00:04:53.550> perk<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.000> I

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
look there's a pretty nice perk and I

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.210 
look there's a pretty nice perk and I
don't<00:04:54.450> know<00:04:54.540> that's<00:04:54.900> just<00:04:54.960> my<00:04:55.170> yeah<00:04:55.710> I'd<00:04:55.950> be<00:04:56.070> on

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
don't know that's just my yeah I'd be on

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.680 
don't know that's just my yeah I'd be on
it<00:04:56.430> why<00:04:56.640> people<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.180> many<00:04:57.300> people<00:04:57.570> use

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
it why people in so many people use

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.320 
it why people in so many people use
black<00:04:58.530> house-made<00:04:58.920> second<00:04:59.400> chance<00:04:59.580> even<00:04:59.850> even

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
black house-made second chance even even

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.770 
black house-made second chance even even
worse<00:05:00.570> because<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:01.230> in<00:05:01.440> other<00:05:01.860> cards<00:05:02.780> second

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
worse because like in other cards second

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.420 
worse because like in other cards second
chance<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.200> second<00:05:04.650> chance<00:05:04.830> or<00:05:05.160> last

chance of you second chance or last

chance of you second chance or last

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
stand or whatever it's called you would

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.170

have liked prints less life say it took
