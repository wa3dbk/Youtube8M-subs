00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.450 
characters have used so there was a lot
of<00:00:28.539> audio<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:29.050> I<00:00:29.080> had<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.380> report

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.740 

start<00:00:37.460> off<00:00:37.580> with<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:37.820> sound<00:00:38.150> idea<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:38.630> create

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
start off with a sound idea to create

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.160 
start off with a sound idea to create
that<00:00:39.500> might<00:00:39.770> be<00:00:40.010> flapping<00:00:40.820> wings<00:00:41.120> could<00:00:42.050> be

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
that might be flapping wings could be

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.540 
that might be flapping wings could be
swinging<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:42.770> sword<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:43.820> equipping<00:00:44.510> armor

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
now I'm not an expert and I don't have

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.410 
now I'm not an expert and I don't have
much<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:50.950> work<00:00:51.100> with<00:00:51.129> here<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.730> didn't<00:00:52.270> create

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
much to work with here I didn't create

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.180 
much to work with here I didn't create
all<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.780> sounds<00:00:53.079> for<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.320> game<00:00:53.500> or<00:00:53.710> for<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
all the sounds for the game or for the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.010 
all the sounds for the game or for the
ones<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.489> I<00:00:54.520> did<00:00:54.640> make<00:00:54.970> I<00:00:55.210> had<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.660> get<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.809> bit

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
ones that I did make I had to get a bit

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.960 
ones that I did make I had to get a bit
creative<00:00:56.280> finding<00:00:57.280> something<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.640> make<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
creative finding something to make the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:55.560 
creative finding something to make the
right<00:00:58.120> sound

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.090 

you're<00:01:56.570> from<00:01:56.750> Ontario<00:01:57.260> like<00:01:57.530> me<00:01:57.770> and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
you're from Ontario like me and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.490 
you're from Ontario like me and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
recognize this it's a coconut hoard and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.920 
recognize this it's a coconut hoard and
for<00:02:01.460> whatever<00:02:01.610> reason<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.450> what<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.630> used

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
for whatever reason this is what I used

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:30.430 
for whatever reason this is what I used
to<00:02:03.050> drop<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> lot<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.800> things<00:02:04.130> on<00:02:28.960> if<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.110> hit<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
to drop a lot of things on if I hit the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.230 
to drop a lot of things on if I hit the
objects<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.950> little<00:02:31.280> differently<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.970> was

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
objects a little differently I was

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.940 
objects a little differently I was
surprised<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.840> find<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.230> could<00:02:33.380> get<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> lot<00:02:33.800> of

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
surprised to find I could get a lot of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:03:11.120 
surprised to find I could get a lot of
different<00:02:34.250> variation<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.880> tone

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.230 

sometimes<00:03:12.130> what<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.430> picked<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:12.850> at<00:03:13.030> first

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
sometimes what I picked up at first

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:41.480 
sometimes what I picked up at first
didn't<00:03:13.930> work<00:03:14.080> out<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.830> I<00:03:14.860> had<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.460> improvise<00:03:15.610> my

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.010 

belt<00:03:42.490> ended<00:03:42.820> up<00:03:42.940> being<00:03:43.150> used<00:03:43.390> for<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.690> lot<00:03:43.930> of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
belt ended up being used for a lot of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.840 
belt ended up being used for a lot of
the<00:03:44.080> sounds<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.590> game<00:03:50.520> finally<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.550> had

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
the sounds in the game finally I had

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.610 
the sounds in the game finally I had
transfer<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.660> recorded<00:03:53.050> sounds<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
transfer the recorded sounds to the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.860 
transfer the recorded sounds to the
computer<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.250> then<00:03:54.790> typically<00:03:55.150> match<00:03:55.570> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
computer and then typically match the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.630 
computer and then typically match the
sounds<00:03:56.170> together<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.860> get<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.040> final<00:03:57.400> effect

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
sounds together to get the final effect

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.000 
sounds together to get the final effect
so<00:03:58.630> here<00:03:58.810> we<00:03:58.930> have<00:03:59.110> one<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.500> sound<00:03:59.710> effects

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
so here we have one of the sound effects

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.770 
so here we have one of the sound effects
from<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.340> game<00:04:00.520> this<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.150> snare<00:04:01.480> trap<00:04:02.730> it's

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
from the game this is a snare trap it's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.180 
from the game this is a snare trap it's
skill<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.990> one<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.260> characters<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:05.860> use

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
skill that one of the characters can use

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.770

and as you can hear it's made up of

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.500 
and as you can hear it's made up of
three<00:04:07.840> different<00:04:08.260> components<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:09.700> end<00:04:10.150> bit

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
three different components the end bit

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.250 
three different components the end bit
here<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.940> some<00:04:12.940> beads<00:04:13.150> rattling<00:04:13.570> around<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:14.020> bag

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
here is some beads rattling around a bag

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.690 
here is some beads rattling around a bag
the<00:04:14.740> middle<00:04:15.040> bit<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:17.049> infamous<00:04:17.980> belt<00:04:18.280> with

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
the middle bit is the infamous belt with

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.800 
the middle bit is the infamous belt with
a<00:04:19.330> distortion<00:04:19.810> effect<00:04:20.200> at<00:04:20.770> the<00:04:20.859> beginning<00:04:21.810> as

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
a distortion effect at the beginning as

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.830 
a distortion effect at the beginning as
me<00:04:23.110> punching<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.920> phone<00:04:24.730> book<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.150> when

me punching a phone book and when

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.770 
me punching a phone book and when
they're<00:04:26.020> blended<00:04:26.350> together<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:28.420> makes<00:04:28.570> that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
they're blended together it makes that

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.750 
they're blended together it makes that
sound<00:04:28.990> no<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> don't<00:04:30.010> know<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.340> that's<00:04:30.520> what<00:04:30.730> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
sound no I don't know if that's what a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.030 
sound no I don't know if that's what a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
snare trap sounds like but once it's in

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.360 
snare trap sounds like but once it's in
game<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.610> actually<00:04:34.000> works

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
game it actually works

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.860
