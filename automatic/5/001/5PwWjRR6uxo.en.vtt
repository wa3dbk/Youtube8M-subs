and<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.289> him<00:00:46.440> coming<00:00:46.649> through<00:00:47.039> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and you can see him coming through but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.299 
and you can see him coming through but
he<00:00:47.640> gives<00:00:47.850> him<00:00:48.000> room<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.890> lock<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
he gives him room and we we lock up the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
he gives him room and we we lock up the
inside<00:00:50.640> front<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.989> look

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
inside front and this is the one look

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
inside front and this is the one look
right<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.100> he<00:00:53.250> does<00:00:53.430> stay<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.940> circuit

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
right here he does stay on the circuit

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410 
right here he does stay on the circuit
so<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.860> late<00:00:56.160> move<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.820> he<00:00:57.210> stays

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
so it was a very late move but he stays

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
so it was a very late move but he stays
on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> circuit<00:00:57.930> Alonso<00:00:58.199> gives<00:00:58.379> him<00:00:58.500> room<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
on the circuit Alonso gives him room and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.250 
on the circuit Alonso gives him room and
at<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.510> feel<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.020> he's

at this point you you feel like he's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
at this point you you feel like he's
looking<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.579> those<00:01:02.789> he's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
looking in the can see those he's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
looking in the can see those he's
checking<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.229> mirror<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.949> knows

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
checking the the right mirror he knows

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
checking the the right mirror he knows
where<00:01:05.339> Alonso<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.659> pop<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:07.020> the

come<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> front<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> he<00:01:11.310> throws<00:01:11.670> his

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
come back in front so that he throws his

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
come back in front so that he throws his
arm<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> air<00:01:12.360> knife<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.140> rightly

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
arm up in the air knife I think rightly

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
arm up in the air knife I think rightly
so<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.799> well<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.460> Alonso<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.299> saw<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so as well and an Alonso we saw that the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
so as well and an Alonso we saw that the
situation<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> start<00:01:16.950> grid<00:01:17.100> after<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
situation on the start grid after the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
situation on the start grid after the
safety<00:01:17.970> car<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.570> shake<00:01:18.840> hands<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
safety car then shake hands because I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
safety car then shake hands because I
think<00:01:19.500> Alonso<00:01:19.979> must<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> felt<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think Alonso must have felt that I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.310 
think Alonso must have felt that I
really<00:01:21.479> had<00:01:21.600> nowhere<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
really had nowhere to go in that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.800 
really had nowhere to go in that
circumstance<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> went<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
circumstance I I went off and you know I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
circumstance I I went off and you know I
got<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> move<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.830> got<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.670> swap

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
got the move I got you back so they swap

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
got the move I got you back so they swap
places<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
places I think that was the right the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.280 
places I think that was the right the
right<00:01:28.770> call<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> steward<00:01:30.210> later<00:01:30.990> on

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
right call there by the steward later on

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
right call there by the steward later on
though<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:32.130> tougher<00:01:32.700> customer<00:01:33.119> Kimi

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
though even tougher customer Kimi

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
though even tougher customer Kimi
räikkönen<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.930> he's<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.619> happy<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
räikkönen and he's not happy about this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
räikkönen and he's not happy about this
whatsoever<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.360> he<00:01:36.390> comes<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> inside

whatsoever and he comes down the inside
you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> already<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.490> Kim<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you can already see here that Kim is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
you can already see here that Kim is
moving<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:39.840> he's<00:01:40.170> giving<00:01:40.890> himself<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
moving over he's giving himself a bit of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
moving over he's giving himself a bit of
a<00:01:41.640> gap<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> curb<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
a gap there to the curb on the right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
a gap there to the curb on the right
hand<00:01:43.500> side<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.640> come<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:45.149> gaps

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.109 
hand side and as we come down our gaps
closing<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:46.380> oh<00:01:46.530> oh<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> contacts

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
closing and we think oh oh and contacts

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.569 
closing and we think oh oh and contacts
almost<00:01:48.479> made<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:49.229> both<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.740> off<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.250> time

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
almost made they both go off this time

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840 
almost made they both go off this time
and<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.579> we're

this reaction followed from Kimi

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.219 
this reaction followed from Kimi
which<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.759> love<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.299> difficult<00:02:00.689> Kimi

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.510 

that<00:02:07.229> idiot<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.830> have<00:02:07.920> cash<00:02:08.130> into<00:02:08.429> his

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that idiot would have cash into his

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
that idiot would have cash into his
whether<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.880> straight<00:02:09.259> excellent<00:02:10.259> stuff

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
whether you go straight excellent stuff

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.530 
whether you go straight excellent stuff
from<00:02:10.679> Kimi<00:02:10.890> räikkönen<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.150> he

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
from Kimi räikkönen and you know what he

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.990 
from Kimi räikkönen and you know what he
was<00:02:12.750> right<00:02:12.990> because<00:02:13.440> later<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.730> coming

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
was right because later on we're coming

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240 
was right because later on we're coming
down<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> same<00:02:15.750> corner<00:02:16.050> even<00:02:16.740> more<00:02:17.100> full

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
down into the same corner even more full

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
down into the same corner even more full
of<00:02:17.340> confidence<00:02:17.550> Kimi<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.300> look<00:02:18.540> at<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
of confidence Kimi now look at that you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
of confidence Kimi now look at that you
can<00:02:19.080> clearly<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.650> difference<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can clearly see the difference of the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580 
can clearly see the difference of the
line<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.630> remember<00:02:22.050> when<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.380> showed

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
line here you can remember when I showed

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.860 
line here you can remember when I showed
you<00:02:22.709> how<00:02:22.860> how<00:02:23.490> big<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.850> gap<00:02:23.970> was<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.510> even

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you how how big the gap was it's even

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.390 
you how how big the gap was it's even
bigger<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:25.410> we're<00:02:25.560> clearly<00:02:25.950> moving

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
bigger this time we're clearly moving

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.180 
bigger this time we're clearly moving
over<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:28.080> haven't<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> gap<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.130> at

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
over and we haven't got a gap here at

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.440 
over and we haven't got a gap here at
this<00:02:29.310> stage<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.090> well<00:02:30.240> now

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
this stage and you just think well now

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
this stage and you just think well now
it's<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:32.040> lock<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.940> crash<00:02:33.180> into

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it's not on and we lock up we crash into

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's not on and we lock up we crash into
the<00:02:33.540> barrier<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.290> damage<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.980> left<00:02:35.550> front<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
the barrier we damage the left front of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.610 
the barrier we damage the left front of
our<00:02:35.940> car<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.420> end<00:02:36.570> plate<00:02:36.780> falling<00:02:37.200> off<00:02:37.320> there

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
our car the end plate falling off there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.160 
our car the end plate falling off there
and<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.610> give<00:02:38.760> Kimi<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> puncture<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:40.080> this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and we give Kimi a puncture and at this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.199 
and we give Kimi a puncture and at this
top<00:02:40.440> stage<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.459> well<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> pit<00:02:42.090> lane

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
top stage as well I think the pit lane

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.690 
top stage as well I think the pit lane
limiter<00:02:42.600> comes<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.080> on<00:02:43.290> Kimi<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:44.010> why<00:02:44.220> he

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
limiter comes on on Kimi that's why he

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.160 
limiter comes on on Kimi that's why he
goes<00:02:44.880> slow<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.330> rewind<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.840> seed<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.110> have

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
goes slow just rewind a seed and have

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800 
goes slow just rewind a seed and have
another<00:02:46.380> look<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.040> rain<00:02:47.280> light<00:02:47.489> comes<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
another look the rain light comes on you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
another look the rain light comes on you
see<00:02:48.930> only<00:02:49.050> thing<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.459> he

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
see only thing I can think is that he

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.920 
see only thing I can think is that he
gets<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.880> pit<00:02:51.030> lane<00:02:51.120> limiter<00:02:51.480> slows<00:02:51.720> down

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
gets on the pit lane limiter slows down

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.720 
gets on the pit lane limiter slows down
massively<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:52.890> cancels<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.550> car

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
massively and then cancels it the car

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.640 
massively and then cancels it the car
squirms<00:02:54.090> around<00:02:54.420> he's<00:02:54.780> carrying<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.290> puncture

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
squirms around he's carrying a puncture

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.560 
squirms around he's carrying a puncture
as<00:02:55.800> well<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.160> left

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
as well on the left

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.210 
as well on the left
Serge's<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.170> he's<00:02:58.320> frustrated<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:59.010> well

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
Serge's you know he's frustrated as well

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.370 
Serge's you know he's frustrated as well
but<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.790> just<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:00.450> over<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> top<00:03:00.840> he

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but I just think it was over the top he

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.290 
but I just think it was over the top he
damaged<00:03:01.739> his<00:03:01.800> car<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.250> process<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.970> when

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
damaged his car in that process and when

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.640 
damaged his car in that process and when
we<00:03:03.390> come<00:03:03.540> around<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> rest<00:03:03.989> cows<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.380> can<00:03:04.500> see
