little<00:00:06.870> while<00:00:07.020> ago<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> was<00:00:07.680> feeding<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> cows

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
little while ago I was feeding the cows

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.070 
little while ago I was feeding the cows
and<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.030> looked<00:00:09.210> down<00:00:09.269> toward<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.690> beat<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and I looked down toward my beat the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.549 
and I looked down toward my beat the
beehives<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.150> I<00:00:12.150> noticed<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:13.259> 40

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
beehives here and I noticed about 40

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.169 
beehives here and I noticed about 40
feet<00:00:13.710> away<00:00:13.830> from<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> hive<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.940> mass

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
feet away from the hive there is a mass

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.349 
feet away from the hive there is a mass
of<00:00:15.450> bees<00:00:16.550> which<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> get

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
of bees which I don't know if I get

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.670 
of bees which I don't know if I get
close<00:00:18.539> enough<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
close enough for you to see that but I

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
close enough for you to see that but I
think<00:00:20.070> there's<00:00:20.460> gonna<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.880> swarm<00:00:21.270> over<00:00:21.449> here

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
think there's gonna be a swarm over here

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:39.360 
think there's gonna be a swarm over here
oh<00:00:29.900> yeah<00:00:30.900> yeah<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> swarm

[Music]
yeah<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.360> called<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> beekeeper<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.980> owns

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
yeah I called the beekeeper that owns

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.210 
yeah I called the beekeeper that owns
these<00:01:46.610> hives<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.330> let<00:01:47.540> her<00:01:47.630> know<00:01:47.660> that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
these hives and let her know that

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.730 
these hives and let her know that
they're<00:01:49.220> swarming

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.050 

right<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.580> worry<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.000> much

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
right now I don't have to worry so much

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.969 
right now I don't have to worry so much
about<00:01:57.420> being<00:01:57.720> stung<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.830> are

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
about being stung because there are

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:27.640 
about being stung because there are
thousands<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.610> them<00:01:59.700> around<00:01:59.939> here

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.740 

so<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.519> is<00:02:28.670> what<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:28.940> looks<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.269> when<00:02:29.480> bees

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
so this is what it looks like when bees

00:02:29.750 --> 00:04:00.199 
so this is what it looks like when bees
swarm

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.330

away from the huts warm here and they
are<00:04:05.489> building<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.629> branch<00:04:07.129> looks<00:04:08.129> like

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
are building up on the branch looks like

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860 
are building up on the branch looks like
they<00:04:08.430> were<00:04:08.549> sitting<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:08.939> the<00:04:09.120> grass<00:04:09.150> at<00:04:09.629> first

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
they were sitting on the grass at first

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.799 
they were sitting on the grass at first
with<00:04:10.019> my<00:04:10.140> grasp<00:04:10.349> lor
