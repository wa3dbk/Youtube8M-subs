 the ability of essential oils to promote physiological effects 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.070
 psychological effects of human beings 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.680
 make the new product valued in domestic and foreign markets 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.630
 its production technology, however, is dominated by few 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.930
 what plants to get them from? 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.190
 how to grow these plants 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 What is the season principle? 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.440
 how to produce on a scale 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 what concerns about the quality of the market 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 those who are most suitable for the production 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.830
 these and other questions are answered in this video course by 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.560
 researchers and by images recorded in teaching and research institutions 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.770
 that stand out in the work with this subject in the country 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.630
 on the technical coordination of the forestry engineer antónio mendes 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.510
 Pine 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.720
 and a professor in forestry engineering

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.010
 fruits seeds and roots of many plants have stored in their tissues 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.729
 oliva-like liquids of complex composition 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.590
 and which are quite volatile 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 generally exuding a pleasant and intense aroma in most cases 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.870
 these characteristics give these substances the name of orizola 3 oils

 all thanks to the presence of more than one hundred chemical constituents 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.379
 contain genital carbon but genius between genius 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.219
 and occasionally hydrogen and sulfur 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.349
 combined in different forms and proportions 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.579
 and who are responsible 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.719
 piloted plants in salford 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.219
 this composition also differentiates essential oils from other types of 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.999
 oils 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.929
 as eye strainers extracted from the jean france seeds 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.389
 various plants and which are used as vehicles for essential oils
