00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a couple other people actually inbox me

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120 
a couple other people actually inbox me
and<00:02:36.150> asked<00:02:36.390> me<00:02:36.540> how<00:02:37.500> many<00:02:37.560> speeds<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and asked me how many speeds the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.250 
and asked me how many speeds the
transmission<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.300> actually<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:40.080> got

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
transmission is it's actually just got

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.130 
transmission is it's actually just got
forward<00:02:40.770> neutral<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> reverse<00:02:41.930> with<00:02:42.930> what

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
forward neutral and reverse with what

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
forward neutral and reverse with what
looks<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.680> some<00:02:44.570> sort<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.720> clutch<00:02:46.080> break<00:02:46.440> a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.860 

little<00:02:51.060> spring<00:02:51.540> guy<00:02:51.840> yeah<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.480> comes

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
little spring guy yeah and it just comes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.400 
little spring guy yeah and it just comes
up<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.050> its<00:02:55.320> handle<00:02:55.710> there<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.570> don't

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
up to its handle there this I don't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
up to its handle there this I don't
remember<00:02:58.710> if<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> mentioned<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.490> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> last

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
remember if I mentioned it in the last

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.600 
remember if I mentioned it in the last
video<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.560> believe<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> tension

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
video but this I believe is the tension

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.660 
video but this I believe is the tension
you'd<00:03:03.000> put<00:03:03.240> on<00:03:03.420> for<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.740> operates<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.370> pulley

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you'd put on for it operates your pulley

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.630 
you'd put on for it operates your pulley
guy<00:03:05.970> there<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:08.040> assuming<00:03:08.310> it'd<00:03:08.550> be

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
guy there so I'm assuming it'd be

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.780 
guy there so I'm assuming it'd be
somewhat<00:03:09.000> like<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> gas<00:03:09.480> pedal<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.200> puts

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
somewhat like a gas pedal which it puts

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.880 
somewhat like a gas pedal which it puts
tension<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.300> belt<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.650> runs<00:03:16.650> off

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
tension on it on a belt that runs off

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.620 
tension on it on a belt that runs off
the<00:03:17.070> bottom<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.490> motor<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.360> way<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the bottom of the motor and that way it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.910 
the bottom of the motor and that way it
would<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:19.020> forward<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:21.920> anyways

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
would just go forward and not anyways

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.410 
would just go forward and not anyways
I'm<00:03:23.100> gonna<00:03:23.220> keep<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.580> one<00:03:23.820> short<00:03:23.850> cuz<00:03:24.300> it's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
I'm gonna keep this one short cuz it's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.590 
I'm gonna keep this one short cuz it's
not<00:03:24.510> too<00:03:24.780> interesting<00:03:25.380> right<00:03:25.620> yet<00:03:26.240> if<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.570> a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
not too interesting right yet if I get a

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.250 
not too interesting right yet if I get a
chance

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
chance

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
chance
what<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.070> Sunday<00:03:29.310> today<00:03:29.630> if<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.720> get<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
what is it Sunday today if I get a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.650 
what is it Sunday today if I get a
chance<00:03:31.200> I'm<00:03:31.770> gonna<00:03:31.890> tear<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.280> hood<00:03:32.459> off<00:03:32.660> start

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
chance I'm gonna tear the hood off start

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.750 
chance I'm gonna tear the hood off start
disassembling<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.470> frame<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> next<00:03:38.670> uh

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
disassembling the frame and the next uh

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.390 
disassembling the frame and the next uh
next<00:03:39.680> next<00:03:40.680> we<00:03:40.769> went<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.100> make<00:03:41.220> is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
next next we went when it make is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.640 
next next we went when it make is
probably<00:03:41.550> try<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.390> everything

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
probably try and get everything

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.890 
probably try and get everything
sandblasted<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.209> get<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.840> to

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
sandblasted so I get it right down to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.080 
sandblasted so I get it right down to
the<00:03:46.110> bare<00:03:46.290> metal<00:03:47.420> once<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.690> happens<00:03:49.170> then

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
the bare metal once that happens then

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.420 
the bare metal once that happens then
primer<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.360> paint<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.160> then<00:03:53.160> I'm<00:03:53.280> gonna

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
primer and paint and then I'm gonna

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
primer and paint and then I'm gonna
start<00:03:53.730> sorting<00:03:54.209> out<00:03:54.330> what<00:03:54.510> kind<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.810> motor<00:03:55.019> is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
start sorting out what kind of motor is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.610 
start sorting out what kind of motor is
gonna<00:03:55.470> sit<00:03:55.769> there<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.580> like<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.090> said<00:04:00.380> inbox<00:04:01.380> me

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
gonna sit there so like I said inbox me

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna sit there so like I said inbox me
or<00:04:02.519> comment<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.630> let<00:04:04.500> me<00:04:04.530> know<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:04.950> kind<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
or comment and let me know what kind of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.280 
or comment and let me know what kind of
motor<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.640> think<00:04:05.940> would<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.269> interesting<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
motor you think would be interesting to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.320 
motor you think would be interesting to
put<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.769> thing<00:04:07.830> nothing<00:04:08.550> too<00:04:08.880> big<00:04:09.060> I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
put on this thing nothing too big I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.900 
put on this thing nothing too big I
don't<00:04:09.630> want<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> go<00:04:10.280> crazy<00:04:11.280> crazy<00:04:11.519> because

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
don't want to go crazy crazy because

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.110 
don't want to go crazy crazy because
that'll<00:04:12.239> take<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.450> lot<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.780> modifications<00:04:13.650> but

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
that'll take a lot of modifications but

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.190 
that'll take a lot of modifications but
enough<00:04:15.120> people<00:04:15.269> ask<00:04:15.600> I'll<00:04:16.470> make<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.830> happen

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
enough people ask I'll make it happen
