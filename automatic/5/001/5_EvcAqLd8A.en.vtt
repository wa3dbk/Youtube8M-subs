00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
how long the meat will stay fresh so

how long the meat will stay fresh so
these<00:03:49.960> two<00:03:50.170> packages<00:03:50.410> look<00:03:50.920> very<00:03:51.280> much<00:03:51.490> like

these two packages look very much like

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.330 
these two packages look very much like
these<00:03:52.210> is<00:03:52.540> there<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> difference<00:03:53.320> well<00:03:54.160> they<00:03:54.280> do

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
these is there a difference well they do

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.800 
these is there a difference well they do
look<00:03:54.460> similar<00:03:54.850> but<00:03:55.210> there<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> key

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
look similar but there is a key

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.320 
look similar but there is a key
difference<00:03:56.050> in<00:03:56.530> these<00:03:57.040> packages<00:03:57.580> the

difference in these packages the
nitrogen<00:03:58.960> that's<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.620> air<00:03:59.740> that<00:03:59.890> we

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
nitrogen that's in the air that we

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
nitrogen that's in the air that we
breathe<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.490> kept<00:04:00.730> at<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.940> very<00:04:01.120> high<00:04:01.300> level<00:04:01.510> but

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
breathe is kept at a very high level but

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.260 
breathe is kept at a very high level but
we<00:04:02.380> remove<00:04:02.680> all<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.340> oxygen<00:04:03.520> from<00:04:04.060> these

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
we remove all of the oxygen from these

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.300 
we remove all of the oxygen from these
we<00:04:04.900> also<00:04:04.930> add<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> small<00:04:05.800> amount<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.100> carbon

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
we also add a small amount of carbon

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.030 
we also add a small amount of carbon
dioxide<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.720> tiny<00:04:08.020> fraction<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.650> carbon

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
dioxide and a tiny fraction of carbon

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.910 
dioxide and a tiny fraction of carbon
monoxide<00:04:09.090> why<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.240> well<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.260> air<00:04:11.650> mix

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
monoxide why is that well that air mix

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.490 
monoxide why is that well that air mix
allows<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.820> product<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.360> stay<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.960> red<00:04:14.200> color

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
allows the product to stay the red color

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.890 
allows the product to stay the red color
but<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.400> also<00:04:15.550> keeps<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.299> meat<00:04:16.450> fresher

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
but it also keeps the meat fresher

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.050 
but it also keeps the meat fresher
longer<00:04:17.200> so<00:04:17.650> these<00:04:18.100> packages<00:04:18.580> have<00:04:18.760> no<00:04:18.910> oxygen

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
longer so these packages have no oxygen

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.990 
longer so these packages have no oxygen
like<00:04:19.510> vacuum

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
like vacuum

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.390 
like vacuum
packaging<00:04:20.329> that's<00:04:20.810> right<00:04:21.109> these<00:04:21.890> packages

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
packaging that's right these packages

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.770 
packaging that's right these packages
because<00:04:22.730> all<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.180> oxygen<00:04:23.330> has<00:04:23.750> been

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
because all of the oxygen has been

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.560 
because all of the oxygen has been
removed<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:25.130> will<00:04:25.280> last<00:04:25.490> about<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:26.180> long<00:04:26.210> as

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
removed they will last about as long as

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.570 
removed they will last about as long as
vacuum<00:04:26.990> packaging<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.100> gives<00:04:28.310> three

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
vacuum packaging so this gives three

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.120 
vacuum packaging so this gives three
benefits<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.300> consumers<00:04:29.680> first<00:04:30.680> it's<00:04:30.980> a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
benefits to consumers first it's a

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.830 
benefits to consumers first it's a
package<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.730> they<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:32.060> see<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.390> product

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
package that they can see the product

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.960 
package that they can see the product
second<00:04:33.710> it's<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.070> color<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.430> they're<00:04:34.730> used

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
second it's in a color that they're used

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.570 
second it's in a color that they're used
to<00:04:35.120> buying<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.720> third<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.800> meat<00:04:37.010> will<00:04:37.130> last<00:04:37.370> a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
to buying and third the meat will last a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.360 
to buying and third the meat will last a
remarkably<00:04:38.120> long<00:04:38.300> time<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:40.070> are<00:04:40.220> there<00:04:40.340> other

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
remarkably long time so are there other

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.070 
remarkably long time so are there other
packaging<00:04:41.000> options<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.450> consumers<00:04:41.900> might

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
packaging options that consumers might

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.410 
packaging options that consumers might
not<00:04:42.230> see<00:04:42.440> there<00:04:43.040> are<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.220> few<00:04:43.460> other<00:04:43.610> options<00:04:43.700> in

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
not see there are a few other options in

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.080 
not see there are a few other options in
this<00:04:44.870> case<00:04:45.110> we've<00:04:45.410> modified<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.520> atmosphere

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
this case we've modified the atmosphere

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.030 
this case we've modified the atmosphere
within<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.510> package<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.560> there<00:04:48.710> are<00:04:48.830> other

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
within the package but there are other

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.610 
within the package but there are other
options<00:04:49.220> where<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:50.240> individual<00:04:50.990> trays<00:04:51.290> like

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
options where the individual trays like

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.770 
options where the individual trays like
this<00:04:51.680> one<00:04:52.190> would<00:04:52.370> be<00:04:52.400> placed<00:04:52.760> into<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.270> larger

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
this one would be placed into a larger

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.740 
this one would be placed into a larger
bag<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.250> gases<00:04:55.669> within<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.180> bag<00:04:56.419> would

bag and the gases within that bag would

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.510 
bag and the gases within that bag would
be<00:04:56.900> changed<00:04:57.350> much<00:04:57.710> like<00:04:57.950> we've<00:04:58.130> done<00:04:58.280> with

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
be changed much like we've done with

be changed much like we've done with
this<00:04:58.669> package<00:04:59.210> when<00:05:00.169> that<00:05:00.350> bag<00:05:00.800> gets<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.400> the

retail store the manager would cut the
