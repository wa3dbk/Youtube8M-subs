works and I do try other stuff all the
time<00:01:03.480> obviously<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:07.229> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
time obviously and it just is not as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
time obviously and it just is not as
good<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.280> main<00:01:08.670> reason<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.600> such

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
good the main reason that there's such

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
good the main reason that there's such
good<00:01:10.140> products<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:12.720> no

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
good products is because there's no

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
good products is because there's no
sulfates<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.680> no<00:01:13.860> parabens<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.549> lot<00:01:14.760> of

sulfates there's no parabens a lot of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
sulfates there's no parabens a lot of
brands<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.560> there's<00:01:16.830> no

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
brands do that now but also there's no

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.030 
brands do that now but also there's no
silicones<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> silicones<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> way

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
silicones and the silicones are a way

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
silicones and the silicones are a way
your<00:01:20.220> hair<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.570> important

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
for someone like me who has ultra fine
hair<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.549> difficult<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.299> get

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
hair because it's very difficult to get

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
hair because it's very difficult to get
any<00:01:27.659> texture<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.640> definitely

any texture to it and so and definitely

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
any texture to it and so and definitely
not<00:01:30.990> volume<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.700> silicones<00:01:33.150> weight

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
