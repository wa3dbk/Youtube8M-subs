00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
sides out the back up and I have a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.970 
sides out the back up and I have a
substantial<00:00:17.760> amount<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.449> up<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
substantial amount right up in here and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.849 
substantial amount right up in here and
what<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> did<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.699> took<00:00:21.060> some<00:00:21.390> hair<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
what I did just took some hair and the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.640 
what I did just took some hair and the
weave<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.939> twisted<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.600> interlocking<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
weave and I twisted it interlocking it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.419 
weave and I twisted it interlocking it
and<00:00:26.689> I'm<00:00:27.689> probably<00:00:27.960> gonna<00:00:28.230> unravel<00:00:28.710> them<00:00:29.099> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and I'm probably gonna unravel them but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.389

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
got this cotton era one on a lowest
degree<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> slightly<00:01:07.260> wanted<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
degree and I just slightly wanted it and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
degree and I just slightly wanted it and
like<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.119> short<00:01:09.420> pieces<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> long<00:01:10.080> pieces

so<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:11.100> cute<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> somewhere<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.119> least

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so some were cute and somewhere at least

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.890 
so some were cute and somewhere at least
I<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.960> irritated<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.340> decided<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
I was so irritated so I just decided to

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.800 
I was so irritated so I just decided to
combine<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.350> weave<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.400> hair<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
combine my weave and my hair to make it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
combine my weave and my hair to make it
one<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.530> curl<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.040> came

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
one like curl so I think that way came

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.899 
one like curl so I think that way came
out<00:01:23.490> better<00:01:24.409> like<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.560> hair<00:01:28.909> like

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
interlocked with this hair with the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.910 
interlocked with this hair with the
weave<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.270> clam<00:01:33.930> Brazilian

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
