00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
on there's a hole in the inside that's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
on there's a hole in the inside that's
where<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.590> loop<00:02:04.770> comes<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.280> where<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> piece

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
where the loop comes out where the piece

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.219 
where the loop comes out where the piece
comes<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.509> where<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.810> hole<00:02:07.020> should

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
comes out that's where the hole should

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.880 
comes out that's where the hole should
be<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.539> loops<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> other<00:02:10.110> side<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.769> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
be so the loops on the other side so the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
be so the loops on the other side so the
diamond<00:02:11.039> should<00:02:11.340> fit<00:02:11.580> perfect<00:02:12.090> where<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
diamond should fit perfect where the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.960 
diamond should fit perfect where the
where<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.349> gold<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:13.980> where<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> hole

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
where the gold is that's where the hole

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.280 
where the gold is that's where the hole
is<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.860> say<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> hole<00:02:18.870> goes<00:02:19.049> at<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
is that say so the hole goes at the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
is that say so the hole goes at the
other<00:02:19.440> side<00:02:19.709> out<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.459> non<00:02:20.640> gold<00:02:21.030> tip<00:02:21.540> side

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
other side out of the non gold tip side

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.420 
other side out of the non gold tip side
you<00:02:22.170> take<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> glue<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.799> this<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.130> again<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you take the glue of this so again it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.680 
you take the glue of this so again it
could<00:02:23.519> be<00:02:23.580> sticky<00:02:23.970> again<00:02:24.150> does<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.450> piece<00:02:24.660> I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
could be sticky again does that piece I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.690 
could be sticky again does that piece I
gave<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.190> problems<00:02:26.630> take<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.010> hole<00:02:29.010> easily

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
gave it problems take the hole easily

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.330 
gave it problems take the hole easily
remove<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.680> stickiness<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.220> these
