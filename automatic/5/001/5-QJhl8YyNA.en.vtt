00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
in heaven in the hole yet so far away I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.219 
in heaven in the hole yet so far away I
am<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.369> hole<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:06.990> getting

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
am from that hole and we're getting

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
am from that hole and we're getting
closer

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.720 

i<00:02:12.050> mounted<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:14.600> wasn't<00:02:15.600> easy<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.460> was<00:02:17.580> able

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
i mounted it wasn't easy but I was able

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.890 
i mounted it wasn't easy but I was able
to<00:02:17.850> do<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.740> speaker<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.070> half<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.430> way

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
to do it the speaker was half that way

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.750 
to do it the speaker was half that way
like<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.050> said<00:02:22.110> around<00:02:22.530> 20<00:02:22.890> pounds<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.430> think

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
like I said around 20 pounds I think

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.100 
like I said around 20 pounds I think
would<00:02:23.850> work<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.150> real<00:02:24.360> well<00:02:24.390> no<00:02:24.780> these<00:02:24.960> are

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
would work out real well no these are

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.850 
would work out real well no these are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
speaker stands are supposed to be for a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.840 
speaker stands are supposed to be for a
much<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.510> much<00:03:09.720> heavier<00:03:10.170> speaker

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
much have a much heavier speaker

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.190 
much have a much heavier speaker
supposed<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.000> easy<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.450> easy<00:03:12.630> down<00:03:12.960> but

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
supposed to be easy up easy down but

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.740 
supposed to be easy up easy down but
right<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.740> easy<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.540> down

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
right now it's just easy up the down

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.949 
right now it's just easy up the down
beats<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.080> little<00:03:16.110> tough<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.690> order

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
beats a little tough so I got order

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.400 
beats a little tough so I got order
different<00:03:19.380> stance<00:03:19.590> from<00:03:19.860> franken<00:03:20.310> stand<00:03:21.410> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
different stance from franken stand to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.500 
different stance from franken stand to
make<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> easy<00:03:22.830> up<00:03:22.980> easy<00:03:23.250> down<00:03:23.489> option<00:03:23.910> happen

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
make the easy up easy down option happen

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.670 
make the easy up easy down option happen
for<00:03:24.720> me<00:03:26.270> not<00:03:27.270> exactly<00:03:27.540> easy<00:03:27.810> down<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.470> got

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
for me not exactly easy down but I got

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670 
for me not exactly easy down but I got
it<00:03:28.800> down<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.840> Frank<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.260> stands<00:03:31.530> are

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
it down so Frank and stands are

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.220 
it down so Frank and stands are
definitely<00:03:32.040> my<00:03:32.160> solution<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> stands<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
definitely my solution for the stands to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.930 
definitely my solution for the stands to
get<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> speakers<00:03:34.739> up<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.130> air<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.959> yeah

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
get the speakers up in the air but yeah

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.340 
get the speakers up in the air but yeah
still<00:03:38.940> having<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.330> puff<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.720> over<00:03:39.930> getting<00:03:40.200> that

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
still having a puff it over getting that

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.229 
still having a puff it over getting that
40-pound<00:03:40.680> speaker<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.430> there<00:03:41.670> as<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.090> see

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
40-pound speaker up there as you can see

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.300 
40-pound speaker up there as you can see
I<00:03:42.269> struggle<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.920> made<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.100> happen

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
I struggle with it but we made it happen

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.240 
I struggle with it but we made it happen
again<00:03:45.000> 20<00:03:45.959> pounds<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.410> probably<00:03:46.680> more<00:03:46.860> like<00:03:47.070> it

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
again 20 pounds is probably more like it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.370 
again 20 pounds is probably more like it
if<00:03:47.459> we're<00:03:47.730> going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.970> go<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.690> setup<00:03:49.320> like

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
if we're going to go with a setup like

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.490 
if we're going to go with a setup like
this<00:03:50.239> otherwise<00:03:51.239> there's<00:03:51.690> some<00:03:51.810> HKS<00:03:52.260> stuff

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this otherwise there's some HKS stuff

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.920 
this otherwise there's some HKS stuff
I'm<00:03:52.590> going<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.769> look<00:03:52.890> at<00:03:53.010> while<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.190> Vanessa<00:03:53.550> or
