00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
about us and this the reason why when

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.520 
about us and this the reason why when
were<00:01:46.540> one<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.930> main<00:01:47.050> reasons<00:01:47.380> why<00:01:47.470> I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
were one of the main reasons why I

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.990 
were one of the main reasons why I
haven't<00:01:47.800> done<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.040> video<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.610> it's<00:01:48.820> really

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
haven't done this video and it's really

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.390 
haven't done this video and it's really
easy<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.660> dance<00:01:49.869> itself<00:01:50.229> one<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.220> main

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
easy the dance itself one of the main

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.070 
easy the dance itself one of the main
reasons<00:01:51.700> why<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:51.820> didn't<00:01:52.090> do<00:01:52.330> this<00:01:52.450> video<00:01:52.660> for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
reasons why I didn't do this video for

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.749 
reasons why I didn't do this video for
the<00:01:53.380> longest<00:01:53.680> time<00:01:53.890> was<00:01:54.040> because<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.340> never<00:01:54.460> had

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
the longest time was because I never had

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.430 
the longest time was because I never had
the<00:01:54.910> song<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.450> apparently<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.110> song<00:01:56.290> is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the song and apparently the song is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.899 
the song and apparently the song is
really<00:01:56.500> hard<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.100> because<00:01:57.580> it's<00:01:57.790> this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
really hard to get because it's this

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.680 
really hard to get because it's this
remix<00:01:58.300> version<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.340> it's<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.480> can't

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
remix version and it's like you can't

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.180 
remix version and it's like you can't
just<00:02:01.840> buy<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.050> off<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.380> iTunes<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
just buy it off of iTunes and the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.280 
just buy it off of iTunes and the
version<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.580> they<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:03.880> there<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.900> not<00:02:05.140> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
version that they have there is not the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.740 
version that they have there is not the
one<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:06.460> like<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.000> normal<00:02:07.270> version<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
one it's like the normal version of the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.850 
one it's like the normal version of the
song<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.200> not<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.410> one<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.590> they<00:02:08.739> do

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
song and it's not the one that they do

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.229 
song and it's not the one that they do
it<00:02:08.979> includes<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:09.580> used<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.179> you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
it includes that I'm used to and you

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.570 
it includes that I'm used to and you
can't<00:02:10.869> do<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.230> song<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.160> don't

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
can't do it to that song but I don't

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.729 
can't do it to that song but I don't
know<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.900> they<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.200> kind<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.410> bothered<00:02:14.709> me

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
know if they just kind of bothered me

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.960 
know if they just kind of bothered me
that<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.310> wasn't<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.730> same<00:02:15.910> thing<00:02:16.380> anyway

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that it wasn't the same thing anyway

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.759 
that it wasn't the same thing anyway

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you can you can really count like this

next ones are going to be claps and so

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.099 
next ones are going to be claps and so
it's<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.769> be<00:03:12.889> right<00:03:13.639> heel<00:03:14.000> up<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.720> one

this<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.319> like<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.310> pretty<00:03:31.579> much<00:03:31.670> the

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
this is like this is pretty much the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.970 
this is like this is pretty much the
easiest<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.569> dance<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.349> still<00:03:33.829> an

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
easiest one dance that is still an

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.629 
easiest one dance that is still an
actual<00:03:34.400> line<00:03:34.549> dance<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.970> me<00:03:36.220> all<00:03:37.220> together

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
actual line dance to me all together

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.020 
actual line dance to me all together
because<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.480> next<00:03:38.840> part<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.290> very<00:03:39.620> different

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
because the next part is very different

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.339 
because the next part is very different
to<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.060> B<00:03:41.269> right<00:03:42.199> right<00:03:43.190> left<00:03:44.120> left<00:03:44.510> right

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
right left when you end up here that the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.520 
right left when you end up here that the
next<00:03:57.919> part<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> dance<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:59.690> probably<00:04:00.079> like

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
next part of the dance is probably like

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.619 
next part of the dance is probably like
the<00:04:00.560> one<00:04:00.889> part<00:04:01.159> that<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.879> made<00:04:02.180> me<00:04:02.299> want<00:04:02.510> to

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
the one part that really made me want to

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.349 
the one part that really made me want to
learn<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:04.129> it's<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.819> school<00:04:05.120> little

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
learn this and it's the school little

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.229 
learn this and it's the school little
and<00:04:05.569> groove<00:04:06.079> things<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.729> most

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
and groove things this is the most

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.659 
and groove things this is the most
complicated<00:04:08.780> part<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.530> dance<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
complicated part of the dance and the

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.839 
complicated part of the dance and the
easiest<00:04:11.030> way<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.949> that<00:04:12.949> I<00:04:12.979> explained<00:04:13.669> it

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
easiest way that I that I explained it

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.649 
easiest way that I that I explained it
to<00:04:13.879> people<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.650> straight<00:04:16.659> you're

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
to people is this is straight you're

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.779 
to people is this is straight you're
going<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.109> groove<00:04:18.409> to<00:04:18.650> your<00:04:18.799> right<00:04:19.039> and<00:04:19.280> then

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
going to groove to your right and then

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.920 
going to groove to your right and then
you're<00:04:20.000> going<00:04:20.239> to

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
you're going to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.080 
you're going to
to<00:04:21.169> your<00:04:21.320> left<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:22.490> if<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.820> remember

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
that you have this next part shouldn't

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.120 
that you have this next part shouldn't
be<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.639> difficult<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:27.110> group<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.979> you're

dance that still kind of looks like a

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.430

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
the hardest part of this line dance is

the hardest part of this line dance is
going<00:07:18.539> to<00:07:18.599> be<00:07:18.660> obtaining<00:07:19.139> that<00:07:19.349> song<00:07:19.710> if<00:07:20.669> you
