00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
much as they could probably still run it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.199 
much as they could probably still run it
maybe<00:03:48.140> for<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> few<00:03:48.590> minutes<00:03:49.220> without<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.060> being

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
maybe for a few minutes without it being

check out their Kickstarter yeah I don't
know<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.889> seems<00:04:16.549> like<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.030> very<00:04:17.060> nice<00:04:17.810> solution

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
know it seems like a very nice solution

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.729 
know it seems like a very nice solution
to<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.070> problem<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.760> might<00:04:19.940> have

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
to a problem you might have

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.120 
to a problem you might have
that<00:04:20.859> would<00:04:21.009> be<00:04:21.190> high<00:04:21.819> tech<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.539> low<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.860> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
that would be high tech and low on the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.700 
that would be high tech and low on the
noticing<00:04:24.819> part<00:04:25.120> many<00:04:25.840> people<00:04:26.259> who<00:04:26.380> would<00:04:26.500> walk

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
noticing part many people who would walk

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.080 
noticing part many people who would walk
into<00:04:26.949> your<00:04:27.099> house<00:04:27.310> probably<00:04:27.789> wouldn't<00:04:28.030> even

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
into your house probably wouldn't even

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.330 
into your house probably wouldn't even
know<00:04:28.479> what<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.020> camera<00:04:29.560> was<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.250> you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
know what that camera was and if you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.010 
know what that camera was and if you
just<00:04:30.550> told<00:04:30.699> him<00:04:30.819> it<00:04:30.940> was<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> Kinect<00:04:31.509> they

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
just told him it was a Kinect they

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.089 
just told him it was a Kinect they
probably<00:04:32.289> wouldn't<00:04:32.590> even<00:04:32.710> know<00:04:32.919> the

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
probably wouldn't even know the

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.430 
probably wouldn't even know the
difference<00:04:33.220> honestly<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:34.690> there<00:04:35.410> you

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
difference honestly and then there you

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.379 
difference honestly and then there you
go<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.130> if<00:04:36.250> they<00:04:36.400> ever<00:04:36.430> came<00:04:36.789> back<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.210> tried

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
go so if they ever came back and tried

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.930 
go so if they ever came back and tried
to<00:04:37.419> rob<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.990> or<00:04:38.259> maybe<00:04:38.919> somebody<00:04:39.460> came<00:04:39.819> in

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
to rob you or maybe somebody came in

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.129 
to rob you or maybe somebody came in
your<00:04:40.030> house<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.479> tried<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.720> rob<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.020> they

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
your house and tried to rob you they

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.570 
your house and tried to rob you they
probably<00:04:41.289> wouldn't<00:04:41.650> even<00:04:41.740> know<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.160> that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
probably wouldn't even know that that

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.809 
probably wouldn't even know that that
Kinect<00:04:43.449> camera<00:04:43.900> was<00:04:44.169> actually<00:04:44.979> doing<00:04:45.520> what<00:04:45.699> it

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
Kinect camera was actually doing what it

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.300 
Kinect camera was actually doing what it
was<00:04:45.940> doing<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.710> then<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.860> would<00:04:48.009> have<00:04:48.130> the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
was doing and then you would have the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.559 
was doing and then you would have the
footage<00:04:48.520> for<00:04:48.789> the<00:04:48.910> police<00:04:49.150> when<00:04:49.419> they

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
footage for the police when they

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.689 
footage for the police when they
probably<00:04:50.169> put<00:04:50.500> their<00:04:50.650> face<00:04:50.889> up<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.520> and

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
probably put their face up to it and

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.370 
probably put their face up to it and
threw<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.240> bag<00:04:52.539> or<00:04:52.720> something<00:04:52.780> when<00:04:53.259> they

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
threw it in a bag or something when they

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.029
