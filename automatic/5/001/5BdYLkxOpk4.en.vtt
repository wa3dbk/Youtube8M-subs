oceans<00:00:15.810> cover<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.230> huge<00:00:16.710> part<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> our<00:00:17.550> planet

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
oceans cover a huge part of our planet

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.720 
oceans cover a huge part of our planet
more<00:00:18.390> than<00:00:18.630> 70%<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:20.310> almost

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
more than 70% that's almost

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.659 
more than 70% that's almost
three-quarters<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> our<00:00:21.689> world<00:00:22.019> but<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.400> all

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
three-quarters of our world but not all

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.970 
three-quarters of our world but not all
of<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:24.029> water<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.480> liquid<00:00:24.660> maybe<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.769> live

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of that water is liquid maybe you live

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.560 
of that water is liquid maybe you live
in<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.220> place<00:00:26.429> that<00:00:26.460> gets<00:00:26.820> cold<00:00:27.119> enough<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> snow

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
in a place that gets cold enough to snow

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
in a place that gets cold enough to snow
did<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.499> know<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.009> most<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.999> fresh

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
did you know that most of the fresh

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
did you know that most of the fresh
water<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:30.900> planet<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.529> frozen<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
water on our planet is frozen and in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.510 
water on our planet is frozen and in
some<00:00:33.000> places<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:34.020> weather<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.470> so<00:00:34.800> cold<00:00:34.830> over

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
some places the weather is so cold over

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
some places the weather is so cold over
a<00:00:35.580> long<00:00:35.760> period<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.270> time<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> snow<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a long period of time that the snow and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
a long period of time that the snow and
ice<00:00:37.890> never<00:00:38.400> melt<00:00:38.730> completely<00:00:38.880> let's<00:00:39.870> talk<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
ice never melt completely let's talk to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
ice never melt completely let's talk to
someone<00:00:40.560> at<00:00:40.860> NASA<00:00:41.130> who<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.700> tell<00:00:41.880> us<00:00:41.910> more

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
someone at NASA who can tell us more

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
someone at NASA who can tell us more
about<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.810> really<00:00:43.170> cool<00:00:43.470> places<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> why

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
about those really cool places and why

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.840 
about those really cool places and why
NASA<00:00:44.880> is<00:00:45.330> interested<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:46.050> studying<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> we're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
NASA is interested in studying so we're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
NASA is interested in studying so we're
all<00:00:47.910> familiar<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> weather<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.080> day<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
all familiar with the weather one day it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
all familiar with the weather one day it
might<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.650> windy<00:00:50.040> another<00:00:50.310> day<00:00:50.490> it<00:00:50.580> might<00:00:50.700> be

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
might be windy another day it might be

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
might be windy another day it might be
sunny<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.540> maybe<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.960> rainy<00:00:52.260> those<00:00:53.040> weather

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
sunny or maybe it's rainy those weather

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.120 
sunny or maybe it's rainy those weather
patterns<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.060> a<00:00:54.330> long<00:00:54.630> period<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> time<00:00:55.230> make

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
patterns over a long period of time make

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.280 
patterns over a long period of time make
up<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.460> call<00:00:56.580> climate<00:00:57.080> another<00:00:58.080> way<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
up what we call climate another way I

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.340 
up what we call climate another way I
like<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.710> explain<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.570> climate<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.080> what

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
like to explain it is climate is what

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
like to explain it is climate is what
you<00:01:01.500> expect<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.430> weather<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.790> what<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.300> get

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you expect but weather is what you get

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
you expect but weather is what you get
so<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.379> climate<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:05.009> over<00:01:05.219> the<00:01:05.309> world<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
so the climate all over the world is is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
so the climate all over the world is is
different<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.479> different<00:01:06.600> places<00:01:06.979> near<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
different in different places near the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
different in different places near the
north<00:01:08.310> pole<00:01:08.579> or<00:01:08.609> the<00:01:08.820> South<00:01:08.939> Pole<00:01:09.149> it's<00:01:09.749> cold

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
north pole or the South Pole it's cold

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
north pole or the South Pole it's cold
year-round<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.799> those<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.609> what<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.060> called

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
year-round and those are what are called

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
year-round and those are what are called
the<00:01:12.390> polar<00:01:12.689> areas<00:01:13.289> it's<00:01:13.799> icy<00:01:14.039> at<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.399> poles<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the polar areas it's icy at the poles of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.789 
the polar areas it's icy at the poles of
the<00:01:15.179> North<00:01:15.390> Pole<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.840> well<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> South<00:01:16.469> Pole

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the North Pole as well as the South Pole

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
the North Pole as well as the South Pole
of<00:01:17.039> our<00:01:17.520> earth<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.060> rock<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.539> is<00:01:18.689> where<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of our earth or rock this is where we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.559 
of our earth or rock this is where we
have<00:01:19.079> these<00:01:19.200> white<00:01:19.469> ice<00:01:19.799> caps<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.569> big

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
have these white ice caps a big

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.510 
have these white ice caps a big
difference<00:01:22.049> between<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.770> Arctic<00:01:23.249> and<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
difference between the Arctic and the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.849 
difference between the Arctic and the
North<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> Antarctic<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> south<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
North in the Antarctic in the south is

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.629 
North in the Antarctic in the south is
that<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.810> Arctic<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.319> North<00:01:28.560> Pole<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.159> ocean

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
that the Arctic the North Pole is ocean

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.730 
that the Arctic the North Pole is ocean
which<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.060> surrounded<00:01:30.600> by<00:01:30.749> land<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.439> United

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
which is surrounded by land the United

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.639 
which is surrounded by land the United
States<00:01:31.950> Canada<00:01:32.310> Russia<00:01:33.020> whereas<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.409> South

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
States Canada Russia whereas the South

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.819 
States Canada Russia whereas the South
Pole<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.399> land<00:01:35.819> surrounded<00:01:36.749> by<00:01:36.869> ocean<00:01:37.289> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
Pole is land surrounded by ocean but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
Pole is land surrounded by ocean but
what's<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.429> special<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.359> icy<00:01:39.840> places

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
what's so special about these icy places

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.730 
what's so special about these icy places
anyway<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> polar<00:01:41.880> regions<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.569> have

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
anyway so in the polar regions we have

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.349 
anyway so in the polar regions we have
continents<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:43.979> snow<00:01:44.249> falls<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.819> it's<00:01:45.179> so

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
continents where snow falls and it's so

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.789 
continents where snow falls and it's so
cold<00:01:45.569> there<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.079> melt<00:01:46.319> in<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:46.590> summer

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
cold there it doesn't melt in the summer

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.230 
cold there it doesn't melt in the summer
and<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.100> snow<00:01:47.340> falls<00:01:47.639> and<00:01:47.819> falls<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and that snow falls and falls and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.520 
and that snow falls and falls and
accumulates<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:48.810> accumulates<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.469> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
accumulates and accumulates and it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.809 
accumulates and accumulates and it
builds<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> builds<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.639> builds

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
builds up and it builds up and it builds

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.389 
builds up and it builds up and it builds
up<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.179> through<00:01:52.109> time<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.859> thousands<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
up and through time over thousands of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.099 
up and through time over thousands of
years<00:01:53.639> they<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.359> what<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.630> call<00:01:54.780> an<00:01:54.929> ice

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
years they make what we call an ice

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.709 
years they make what we call an ice
sheet<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.009> ice<00:01:56.219> sheets<00:01:56.490> are<00:01:56.729> ice<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.509> on

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
sheet so ice sheets are ice that's on

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.910 
below or above the area of the ice gets
smaller<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> amount<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.680> sunlight

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
smaller and so the amount of sunlight

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.770 
smaller and so the amount of sunlight
that<00:03:47.099> normally<00:03:47.730> gets<00:03:47.880> reflected<00:03:48.150> from<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
that normally gets reflected from the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.839 
that normally gets reflected from the
ice<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.170> actually<00:03:49.560> instead<00:03:50.010> absorbed<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.639> so

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
ice is actually instead absorbed and so

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.539 
ice is actually instead absorbed and so
the<00:03:51.450> ocean<00:03:52.200> temperatures<00:03:52.650> themselves<00:03:53.190> heat

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the ocean temperatures themselves heat

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.030 
the ocean temperatures themselves heat
up<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.599> in<00:03:54.810> turn<00:03:55.019> raises<00:03:55.470> temperatures

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
up and that in turn raises temperatures

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.069 
up and that in turn raises temperatures
in<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> Arctic<00:03:56.370> which<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.540> turn<00:03:57.569> also

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
in the Arctic which then in turn also

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.140 
in the Arctic which then in turn also
cause<00:03:58.440> more<00:03:58.650> melting<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.160> ice<00:03:59.250> both<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
cause more melting of the ice both the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.960 
cause more melting of the ice both the
ice<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> oceans<00:04:01.019> in<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.230> polar<00:04:01.410> regions

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
ice and the oceans in the polar regions

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.390 
ice and the oceans in the polar regions
drive<00:04:02.970> global<00:04:03.720> climate

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
drive global climate

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.869 
drive global climate
okay<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.750> oceans<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.280> ice<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.700> them

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
okay so the oceans and the ice in them

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.699 
okay so the oceans and the ice in them
hope<00:04:09.480> control<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.110> temperatures<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.680> earth

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
hope control the temperatures on earth

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.059 
hope control the temperatures on earth
and<00:04:11.670> with<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> help<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.540> ice<00:04:12.750> at<00:04:13.110> two<00:04:13.470> NASA

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
and with the help of ice at two NASA

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.400 
and with the help of ice at two NASA
will<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.580> able<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.000> watch<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.629> changes<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.199> ice

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
will be able to watch the changes in ice

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.310 
will be able to watch the changes in ice
thickness<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.190> all<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.150> information<00:04:18.870> can

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
thickness and all that information can

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.140 
thickness and all that information can
be<00:04:19.470> used<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.889> help<00:04:20.040> us<00:04:20.310> take<00:04:20.579> better<00:04:20.820> care<00:04:21.090> of
