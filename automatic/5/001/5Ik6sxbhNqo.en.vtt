it really was released under a multitude
of<00:00:26.730> names<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.330> basically<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
they be games or not but they made

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
they be games or not but they made
different<00:00:34.290> ones<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.489> different<00:00:35.880> colors<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
different ones with different colors and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
different ones with different colors and
almost<00:00:37.140> made<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.380> seem<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
almost made it seem like if it was a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
almost made it seem like if it was a
video<00:00:39.000> game<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.329> had<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.320> with

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
video game you had to get this one with

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
video game you had to get this one with
the<00:00:40.620> green<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> DVD<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> think

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the green and if it was a DVD I think

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
the green and if it was a DVD I think
they<00:00:42.300> had<00:00:42.420> blue<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
they had blue or something like that and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.549 
they had blue or something like that and
they<00:00:44.219> still<00:00:44.460> sell<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:44.910> today<00:00:45.289> what<00:00:46.289> it

they still sell these today what it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
they still sell these today what it
basically<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.820> takes<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.450> discs

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and it sands off a layer of it with this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.950 
and it sands off a layer of it with this
very<00:00:52.770> fine<00:00:53.280> sandpaper<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.420> wheel<00:00:54.660> what

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very fine sandpaper on this wheel what

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
very fine sandpaper on this wheel what
you<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.520> disc

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you have to do is you get your disc

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
you have to do is you get your disc
you're<00:00:57.270> supposed<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> spray<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you're supposed to spray it with a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
you're supposed to spray it with a
solution<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.890> include<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
solution they include I think it's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
solution they include I think it's
basically<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.050> distilled<00:01:01.500> water<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.859> can

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
basically just distilled water you can

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.310 
basically just distilled water you can
use<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.940> after<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.960> put<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
use it so after you do that you put this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.780 
use it so after you do that you put this
in<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:05.850> cranking<00:01:06.510> away

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
in and you just start cranking away

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
in and you just start cranking away
there<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.869> keep<00:01:10.200> cranking

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
there you go and you just keep cranking

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370 
there you go and you just keep cranking
and<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.280> wheel<00:01:11.549> slowly<00:01:12.000> rotates<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.200> do

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and this wheel slowly rotates as you do

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.690 
and this wheel slowly rotates as you do
it<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> until<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.430> makes<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it you have to do it until it makes a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.690 
it you have to do it until it makes a
full<00:01:14.880> revolution<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.920> counting<00:01:17.369> today<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
full revolution I was counting today I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
full revolution I was counting today I
was<00:01:17.909> practicing<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.869> old<00:01:19.350> DVD<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
was practicing on this old DVD I had and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.940 
was practicing on this old DVD I had and
it<00:01:20.939> takes<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> hundred<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.229> ten<00:01:22.500> cranks

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it takes about a hundred and ten cranks

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
it takes about a hundred and ten cranks
for<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:23.850> around<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
for it to go all the way around and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
for it to go all the way around and

supposed<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> again<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.930> Reverse<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
supposed to do it again in Reverse so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's nice and even so you flip the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
it's nice and even so you flip the
switch<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> back<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> other

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
switch here on the back to the other

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
switch here on the back to the other
direction<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.790> start<00:01:33.030> cranking<00:01:33.540> away

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
direction and you start cranking away

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.649 
direction and you start cranking away
again<00:01:34.079> another<00:01:34.740> hundred<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> ten<00:01:35.640> cranks<00:01:36.150> so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
little bit with the quality of the
playback<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.369> sometimes<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.939> had<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
playback but sometimes I had to do it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
playback but sometimes I had to do it
multiple<00:01:57.540> times<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.890> get<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> disc<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> work<00:01:59.759> if

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
multiple times to get a disc to work if

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.940 
multiple times to get a disc to work if
the<00:02:00.060> scratch<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.899> bit<00:02:01.020> deeper<00:02:01.229> even

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the scratch was a little bit deeper even

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
the scratch was a little bit deeper even
if<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> didn't<00:02:02.490> look<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.640> deep<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.509> also

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
if it didn't look that deep and also

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
if it didn't look that deep and also
sometimes<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.979> flat-out<00:02:05.280> didn't<00:02:05.759> work

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
sometimes it just flat-out didn't work

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370 
sometimes it just flat-out didn't work
and<00:02:06.149> another<00:02:06.479> thing<00:02:06.689> about<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.229> don't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and another thing about this I don't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.719 
and another thing about this I don't
know<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> leaves<00:02:08.489> all

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
know if you can see it but it leaves all

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.330 
know if you can see it but it leaves all
these<00:02:09.119> lines<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:10.860> lines<00:02:11.160> from

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
these lines you see all these lines from

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610 
these lines you see all these lines from
the<00:02:11.550> sanding<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:13.140> are

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the sanding so if you are

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
the sanding so if you are
a perfectionist<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> little

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
a perfectionist and you see a little

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.670 
a perfectionist and you see a little
scratch<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:15.750> your<00:02:15.900> disk<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.530> want

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
scratch on your disk and you just want

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.530 
scratch on your disk and you just want
to<00:02:16.799> kind<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> erase<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.790> off<00:02:17.909> it's<00:02:18.180> not<00:02:18.360> going

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to kind of erase it off it's not going

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.820 
to kind of erase it off it's not going
to<00:02:18.599> do<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.349> actually<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.739> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to do that and it's actually going to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.320 
to do that and it's actually going to
create<00:02:20.040> more<00:02:20.340> where<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:20.970> you'll

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
create more where you're you'll

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.210 
create more where you're you'll
definitely<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.680> disk<00:02:23.010> has<00:02:23.190> been

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
definitely see that a disk has been

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.680 
definitely see that a disk has been
resurfaced<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:23.909> if<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.060> ever<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> disc

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
resurfaced so if you ever see a disc

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.140 
resurfaced so if you ever see a disc
with<00:02:24.870> these<00:02:25.019> lines<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.650> means<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.790> one

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
with these lines it means it was in one

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.030 
with these lines it means it was in one
of<00:02:27.269> these<00:02:27.390> devices<00:02:27.840> after<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> take<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.799> out

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
of these devices after you take it out

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.170 
of these devices after you take it out
you're<00:02:29.250> supposed<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.549> dry<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.819> off<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you're supposed to dry it off with a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.789 
you're supposed to dry it off with a
special<00:02:30.629> cloth<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.260> even<00:02:31.470> give<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
special cloth and they even give you a

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.920 
special cloth and they even give you a
little<00:02:31.980> buffing<00:02:32.459> square<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.090> little<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
little buffing square a little bit of a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.020 
little buffing square a little bit of a
firmer<00:02:34.200> cloth<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:35.099> buff<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.640> stuff

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
firmer cloth that you can buff out stuff

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.030 
firmer cloth that you can buff out stuff
I<00:02:36.180> suppose<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:37.230> yeah<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:37.709> that's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
I suppose but yeah that's that's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.240 
I suppose but yeah that's that's
basically<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.299> nutshell<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.930> course

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
basically it in a nutshell now of course

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
basically it in a nutshell now of course
using<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.730> hand<00:02:41.970> motion<00:02:42.390> could<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.659> tiresome

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
using the hand motion could get tiresome

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.559 
using the hand motion could get tiresome
so<00:02:43.349> they<00:02:43.530> eventually<00:02:44.459> released<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:45.000> motorized

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
so they eventually released a motorized

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.210 
so they eventually released a motorized
version<00:02:45.989> that's<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.920> right

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
version that's what this one is right

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.670 
version that's what this one is right
here<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:48.720> these<00:02:48.900> sanding<00:02:49.440> wheels

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
here and because these sanding wheels

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.729 
here and because these sanding wheels
can<00:02:50.069> run<00:02:50.280> out<00:02:50.430> they<00:02:50.609> also<00:02:50.730> sold<00:02:51.739> replacement

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
can run out they also sold replacement

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.020 
can run out they also sold replacement
kits<00:02:52.950> which<00:02:53.220> gave<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.579> more<00:02:53.760> cleaning

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
kits which gave you more cleaning

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.670 
kits which gave you more cleaning
solution<00:02:54.569> which<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:55.019> again<00:02:55.410> think<00:02:55.590> as

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
solution which are just again think as

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.830 
solution which are just again think as
the<00:02:55.890> distilled<00:02:56.310> water<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.790> another<00:02:57.299> sanding

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the distilled water and another sanding

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.289 
the distilled water and another sanding
wheel<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.799> even<00:02:59.280> came<00:02:59.489> with<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.030> nice

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
wheel some even came with this nice

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.720 
wheel some even came with this nice
adapter<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.440> cool<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.159> GameCube

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
adapter very cool it's for the GameCube

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.420 
adapter very cool it's for the GameCube
games<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.420> they<00:03:03.540> could<00:03:03.720> fit<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.079> there<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.560> very

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
games so they could fit on there so very

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.530 
games so they could fit on there so very
cool<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.819> they<00:03:05.909> gave<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.180> something<00:03:06.390> for

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
cool that they gave you something for

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.649 
cool that they gave you something for
the<00:03:06.599> GameCube<00:03:07.109> games<00:03:07.349> but<00:03:07.980> overall<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.849> wasn't

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
the GameCube games but overall I wasn't

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.240 
the GameCube games but overall I wasn't
very<00:03:09.840> impressed<00:03:10.260> with<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> lot<00:03:11.220> of

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
very impressed with it it was a lot of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.670 
very impressed with it it was a lot of
work<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.849> didn't<00:03:12.239> deliver<00:03:12.480> easily<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
work it didn't deliver easily and it

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.500 
work it didn't deliver easily and it
kind<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.069> left<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.549> disc<00:03:14.790> look<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> worse

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
kind of left your disc look and worse

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.750 
kind of left your disc look and worse
than<00:03:15.750> before<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.290> most<00:03:16.680> cases<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.340> least<00:03:17.519> for

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
than before in most cases at least for

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
than before in most cases at least for
me<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.269> my<00:03:18.299> scratches<00:03:18.989> tended<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.349> be

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
me because my scratches tended to be

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.789 
me because my scratches tended to be
very<00:03:19.500> light<00:03:20.099> and<00:03:20.599> yeah<00:03:21.599> not<00:03:21.989> something<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.530> used

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
very light and yeah not something I used

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.500 
very light and yeah not something I used
except<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.489> budget<00:03:23.880> titles<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.299> bought

basically all I used it for and the

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.680 
basically all I used it for and the
success<00:03:29.549> was<00:03:29.700> kind<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.030> minimal<00:03:30.299> they<00:03:30.450> still

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
success was kind of minimal they still

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.020

usually in the ballpark at $20 usually a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.349 
usually in the ballpark at $20 usually a
little<00:03:35.220> bit<00:03:35.340> more<00:03:35.549> or<00:03:35.669> less<00:03:35.879> I<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.090> they're

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
little bit more or less I think they're

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.509

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
these motorized units which don't look

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.869 
these motorized units which don't look
like<00:03:40.919> this<00:03:41.099> anymore<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:41.609> they<00:03:41.700> sell

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
like this anymore but they sell

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.210 
like this anymore but they sell
motorized<00:03:42.299> units<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.049> they<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:43.530> usually<00:03:43.859> into

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
motorized units and they go usually into

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.580

$30<00:03:44.879> ball<00:03:45.120> park<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.480> think<00:03:45.510> sometimes<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.500> little

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
$30 ball park I think sometimes a little

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.439 
$30 ball park I think sometimes a little
bit<00:03:46.709> less<00:03:46.919> and<00:03:47.069> more<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.730> overall<00:03:48.000> I'd<00:03:48.419> say

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
bit less and more but overall I'd say

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.559 
bit less and more but overall I'd say
pass<00:03:49.199> on<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.769> skip<00:03:50.069> doctor<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.669> find<00:03:51.359> a

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
pass on the skip doctor and find a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.349 
pass on the skip doctor and find a
center<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.470> has<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:53.359> professional

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
center that has a professional

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.509 
center that has a professional
resurfacing<00:03:55.199> machine<00:03:55.230> where<00:03:55.769> they<00:03:55.980> resurface

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
resurfacing machine where they resurface

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.129 
resurfacing machine where they resurface
your<00:03:56.879> discs<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.329> like<00:03:57.480> something<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.870> three

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
your discs for like something like three

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.479 
your discs for like something like three
or<00:03:58.230> four<00:03:58.290> bucks<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.799> think<00:03:59.010> that's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.310> better

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
or four bucks I think that's a better

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.360 
or four bucks I think that's a better
investment<00:04:00.120> than<00:04:00.930> buying<00:04:01.440> one<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.739> these<00:04:01.949> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
investment than buying one of these and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.680 
investment than buying one of these and
kind<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> scratching<00:04:03.000> up<00:04:03.120> your<00:04:03.150> discs<00:04:03.480> so

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
kind of scratching up your discs so

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.039 
kind of scratching up your discs so
there<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.470> go<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.010> Skip<00:04:05.370> dr.<00:04:06.000> something<00:04:06.870> that

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
there you go the Skip dr. something that

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.050 
there you go the Skip dr. something that
I<00:04:07.079> wouldn't<00:04:07.560> recommend<00:04:07.889> maybe<00:04:08.579> only<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
I wouldn't recommend maybe only to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.280 
I wouldn't recommend maybe only to
someone<00:04:09.239> who<00:04:09.449> has<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.599> bunch<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.930> kids<00:04:10.169> who

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
someone who has a bunch of kids who

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.629 
someone who has a bunch of kids who
always<00:04:10.440> scratch<00:04:10.739> up<00:04:10.919> their<00:04:11.069> DVDs<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.579> you

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
always scratch up their DVDs and you

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.610 
always scratch up their DVDs and you
don't<00:04:11.819> care<00:04:12.000> about<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.329> condition<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:13.500> in

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
don't care about the condition but in

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.349 
don't care about the condition but in
that<00:04:13.709> case<00:04:13.919> I'll<00:04:14.129> probably<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.489> Roman<00:04:14.819> ruin

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359
