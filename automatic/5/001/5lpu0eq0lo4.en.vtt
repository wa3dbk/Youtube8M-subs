00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
below so then I'm just going to get a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
below so then I'm just going to get a
little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> product<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.289> eyeliner

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
little bit of product on my eyeliner

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760 
little bit of product on my eyeliner
brush<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.579> sure<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.879> flat<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.770> I'm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
brush and make sure it's flat and I'm

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
brush and make sure it's flat and I'm
going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> create<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> line<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.210> almost

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
going to create a line that's almost

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.869 
going to create a line that's almost
straight<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.620> angled<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
straight but angled a little bit up and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.810 
straight but angled a little bit up and
then<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.530> drag<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> brush<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then I'm just going to drag the brush in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
then I'm just going to drag the brush in
word<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.809> connects<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.500> line<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
word so that it connects the line to the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
word so that it connects the line to the
rest<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> eyeliner<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
rest of the eyeliner and this is the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
rest of the eyeliner and this is the
technique<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.540> all<00:01:06.540> three

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
technique that I use for all three

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
technique that I use for all three
products<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.670> different<00:01:08.909> each

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
products but it's kind of different each

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.200 
products but it's kind of different each
time<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:10.020> why

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
time that's why

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.800 
time that's why
with<00:01:11.510> all<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.960> them

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
with all of them

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.970 
with all of them
so<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> next<00:01:15.080> product<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.560> going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.770> be<00:01:15.830> using

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
so the next product is going to be using

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.830 
so the next product is going to be using
is<00:01:16.220> eyeshadow<00:01:16.730> and<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.330> definitely<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
is eyeshadow and this is definitely the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.660 
is eyeshadow and this is definitely the
easiest<00:01:17.870> way<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.530> do<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.800> winged<00:01:18.980> eyeliner<00:01:19.220> look

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
easiest way to do a winged eyeliner look

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.800 
easiest way to do a winged eyeliner look
so<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:19.850> do<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:20.060> when<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.270> don't<00:01:20.510> have<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.660> lot<00:01:20.780> of

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
so I do this when I don't have a lot of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.500 
so I do this when I don't have a lot of
time<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:22.370> two<00:01:22.520> eyeshadows<00:01:22.730> that<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.180> use

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
time and the two eyeshadows that I use

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.260 
time and the two eyeshadows that I use
are<00:01:23.840> either<00:01:24.260> shadow<00:01:24.980> a<00:01:25.070> lady<00:01:25.340> from<00:01:25.580> back<00:01:25.790> or

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
are either shadow a lady from back or

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.540 
are either shadow a lady from back or
contrast<00:01:27.050> which<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.440> also<00:01:27.650> from<00:01:28.010> Mac<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.400> like

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
contrast which is also from Mac I like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.730 
contrast which is also from Mac I like
using<00:01:28.760> colored<00:01:29.240> eye<00:01:29.360> shadows<00:01:29.720> when<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.410> do<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
using colored eye shadows when I do this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.520 
using colored eye shadows when I do this
so<00:01:31.550> again<00:01:32.060> i'm<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.480> applying<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.110> like<00:01:33.320> i

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so again i'm just applying it like i

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.900 
so again i'm just applying it like i
would<00:01:33.770> regular<00:01:34.430> eyeliner<00:01:34.940> at<00:01:35.120> first<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:36.910> then

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
would regular eyeliner at first and then

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.670 
would regular eyeliner at first and then
i'm<00:01:38.150> going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.330> do<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.540> same<00:01:38.570> technique<00:01:39.290> where

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
i'm going to do the same technique where

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.450 
i'm going to do the same technique where
I<00:01:40.180> just<00:01:41.180> simply<00:01:41.600> make<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> line<00:01:42.380> that's<00:01:42.860> kind<00:01:43.340> of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
I just simply make a line that's kind of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.000 
I just simply make a line that's kind of
angled<00:01:43.970> outward<00:01:44.210> kind<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.990> straight<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.740> then

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
angled outward kind of straight and then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.980

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.009 
one I kind of lazy you felt tip marker
on<00:02:28.430> its<00:02:28.640> side<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:31.000> simply<00:02:32.000> make<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.629> wing

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
on its side and simply make the wing

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.470 
on its side and simply make the wing
make<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> line<00:02:33.980> flowing<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.700> drag<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.299> at

make a line flowing and drag it in at
any<00:02:35.900> time<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.519> little<00:02:37.819> bit<00:02:37.910> easier

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
any time so this is a little bit easier

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.300 
any time so this is a little bit easier
than<00:02:38.599> may<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.810> doing<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.200> with<00:02:39.230> gel<00:02:39.560> liner<00:02:39.829> um

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
than may be doing it with gel liner um

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.759 
than may be doing it with gel liner um
but<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.090> also<00:02:41.329> don't<00:02:41.630> make<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.959> as<00:02:42.049> dramatic<00:02:42.560> as

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
but I also don't make it as dramatic as

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.130 
but I also don't make it as dramatic as
I<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.190> Joey<00:02:43.370> light<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:44.989> have

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I do it Joey light or so you just have

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.800 
I do it Joey light or so you just have
to<00:02:45.260> adjust<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.709> what<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.220> like<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:46.879> do

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to adjust it to what you like but I do

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.289 
to adjust it to what you like but I do
this<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.410> pretty<00:02:48.799> much<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:48.950> daily<00:02:49.400> basis<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.060> I

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
this on pretty much a daily basis and I

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:06.099 
this on pretty much a daily basis and I
really<00:02:50.510> like<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> nice<00:03:05.299> method<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.870> using

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
pencil eyeliner was definitely really

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.449 
pencil eyeliner was definitely really
difficult<00:03:08.269> for<00:03:08.299> me<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:09.109> use<00:03:09.769> this<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.310> as

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
difficult for me but I use this do as

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.220 
difficult for me but I use this do as

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
can be switched out and basically they

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.949 
can be switched out and basically they
just<00:03:16.790> had<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> lot<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.389> trouble<00:03:17.720> with<00:03:17.810> this

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
just had a lot of trouble with this

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.110 
just had a lot of trouble with this
usually<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> try<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.829> blend<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.220> eyeliner<00:03:19.970> on

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.430 
usually I try to blend this eyeliner on
with<00:03:20.269> my<00:03:20.420> fingers<00:03:20.780> but<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.079> wasn't<00:03:21.319> working

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
with my fingers but it wasn't working

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.530 
with my fingers but it wasn't working
today<00:03:21.829> so<00:03:22.099> I<00:03:23.049> just<00:03:24.049> went<00:03:24.200> back<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.329> used<00:03:26.329> a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
today so I just went back in and used a

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.890 
today so I just went back in and used a
smudger<00:03:27.290> brush<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.099> anytime

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
smudger brush so anytime

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.410 
smudger brush so anytime
bristle<00:03:29.769> brush<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.459> impede<00:03:30.939> everyone

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
bristle brush that impede everyone

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.809 
bristle brush that impede everyone
started<00:03:31.950> when<00:03:32.950> wears<00:03:33.129> off<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.579> I

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
started when wears off of this I

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.589 
started when wears off of this I
basically<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.390> apply<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.019> eyeliner<00:03:35.319> and

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
basically just apply the eyeliner and

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.800 
basically just apply the eyeliner and
smudge<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.870> out<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.500> kind<00:03:39.159> of<00:03:39.370> use<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.569> same

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
smudge it out so I kind of use the same

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.720 
smudge it out so I kind of use the same
technique<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.409> dragging<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.099> eyeliner<00:03:42.459> in

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
technique of dragging the eyeliner in

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.819 
technique of dragging the eyeliner in
word<00:03:42.909> but<00:03:42.939> then<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.870> took<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:45.209> smudger<00:03:46.209> brush<00:03:46.329> and

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
word but then I took a smudger brush and

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.349 
word but then I took a smudger brush and
just<00:03:47.829> made<00:03:48.189> a<00:03:48.220> line<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.519> little<00:03:48.700> bit<00:03:48.849> more<00:03:49.060> even

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
just made a line a little bit more even

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.140 
just made a line a little bit more even
and<00:03:49.870> fix<00:03:50.799> any<00:03:51.010> mistakes<00:03:51.099> because<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.060> is

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
and fix any mistakes because it is

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.630 
and fix any mistakes because it is
really<00:03:52.420> hard<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.689> make<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.200> sharp<00:03:54.010> line<00:03:54.280> with

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
really hard to make a sharp line with

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.059 
really hard to make a sharp line with
pencil<00:03:55.209> eyeliner<00:03:55.569> and<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.470> mess<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.680> it's

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
pencil eyeliner and if you mess up it's

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.860 
pencil eyeliner and if you mess up it's
really<00:03:57.280> easy<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.579> take<00:03:57.849> just<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.480> little<00:03:58.510> bit<00:03:58.810> of

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
really easy to take just a little bit of

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.449 
really easy to take just a little bit of
makeup<00:03:59.049> remover<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.500> makeup<00:03:59.920> remover<00:04:00.280> wipe

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
and just wipe it away and fix it so you

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.660 
and just wipe it away and fix it so you
can<00:04:03.639> go<00:04:03.790> back<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.420> fill<00:04:05.079> in<00:04:05.200> any<00:04:05.409> gaps<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:06.159> it's

can go back and fill in any gaps if it's

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.119 
can go back and fill in any gaps if it's
much<00:04:06.909> the<00:04:06.940> way<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.180> want<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.510> or<00:04:08.129> whatever

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
much the way you want it to or whatever

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.789 
much the way you want it to or whatever
the<00:04:09.400> problem<00:04:09.579> might<00:04:09.819> be<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.590> one

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
the problem might be and so this one

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.349 
the problem might be and so this one
takes<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.220> lot<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.430> practice<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.180> don't

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
takes a lot of practice and I don't

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.729 
takes a lot of practice and I don't
usually<00:04:13.569> do<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.049> I<00:04:14.319> thought<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.620> would

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
usually do this I thought I would

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:23.640 
usually do this I thought I would
include<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.639> video<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:16.229> yeah
