00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.360
 hey people after element here and today 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.400
 with great new information on vigorous ghost 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.370
 with estrada it's not just food 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.980
 but yes there are new information goes 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.560
 put infos converts radioshack comes out 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.050
 that would be what you do and what you still have there 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.270
 So the text the description of the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 side where you are already so mosers already 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.200
 to pre-order where it is 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.489
 also the laid image gives something too 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.789
 just in the background is that 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.070
 Cover image is it will be selling so 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.260
 the pack picture on the side exactly on 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.699
 the description changed and the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.079
 description is about the way he 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.940
 sat down and I say it now 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.859
 summarized in German 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.260
 So it's great to collect the new one 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.059
 define so completely different 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.100
 Be the story is completely new in 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.319
 Every strong person should take a new step 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.059
 The car is free and forward 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.289
 perhaps one will thereby directs the 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.059
 completely different this call of duty or 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.070
 maybe like sunrise and new ones 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 things are so riskmetrics so in 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.230
 I believe the direction rather than 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 cool when it's completely new story and it 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.940
 intended with the new call of duty engine 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.570
 what you want next next next 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.220
 generation stop and what can take away 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.750
 There are two things we can absorb 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.910
 So the text either it is new 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.260
 consoles so she's probably up 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.540
 the new consoles or you have one 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.420
 new engine as well as cry engine 4 now 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.400
 three stop this now grange for example 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.780
 is four years old so indian 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.570
 maybe knows such at home looks 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.220
 yes, you might as a new engine 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.230
 the better graphics even that was 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.600
 Cool because they are just the same 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.760
 engine is supposed to be there now 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.320
 next time worse troll 30 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.610
 rauskommt trailer on the first five only 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.150
 Once there is a picture in it 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.980
 background 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.860
 that should take us the poster takes on it 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.200
 domain first fifth and black ops 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.470
 Klarner not occupancy plan old so also 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.600
 in the field or so one day before 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.759
 it stopped the campaign 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.960
 advertising campaign you have a trailer out 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.290
 so not in advertising campaign more 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.750
 to pre-order rush to have the must 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.880
 before can last as a day 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 before that had the whole so in the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.850
 trailer aus so needs only on the 30th 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.930
 So in two days and then 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.250
 that probably a trailer from the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.780
 What I think are trainer 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.430
 Really come out that if you 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.770
 the first option and above all as 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.070
 a first fifth to pre-order 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.250
 So the cyclist is next again 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.850
 declared stupid on 30 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.050
 trainer French shorts and on the fifth 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.480
 consist first child before 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.280
 probably or surely it can be 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.880
 that as with call of duty black ops 2 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.860
 is that the poster trafton and that one 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.420

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.290
 picture of black ops appears when you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.020
 from behind announced announced 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.460
 they then cancel in the trailer 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.470
 So that the coach then a week 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.400
