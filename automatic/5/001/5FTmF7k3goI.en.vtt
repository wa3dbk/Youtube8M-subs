00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Yup 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.369
 caesar that are the former found with 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 this new video today carries a camst 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.450
 confined to all against all in octane 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.430
 conlon emerge a class totally 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.349
 made at home always ask me in the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.340
 class in the comments some have me 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.970
 said to always put it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.589
 description but since it is always the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.920
 itself but with some variation 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:42.620
 however which may be the weapon or 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.860
 the third because there is not in fact me 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.070
 i have three classic sets three set classes 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.199
 classic engine I use practically 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.760
 always with the same specialties then 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.210
 the weapon changes it depending on what 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.199
 you want to use then in this commentary 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.260
 since we have enough time 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.070
 because this room you need to know 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.840
 that I had done the live for him 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.420
 Special special than 7 thousand subscribers 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.940
 then unfortunately I could not do it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.830
 or that of the caire of nuclear 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.530
 of the new kids live for lack of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.399
 time because as many of you will know 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.259
 in fact I told you that I would have 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.000
 a bit of difficulty to propose it again because 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.190
 I don't have the chance to do live 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.440
 when I like it the most 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.410
 so I managed to do it that me then 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.020
 I tried one day in the south and cox 2 but 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.179
 I really did not want me to win the day 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 because he would not without trying to do 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.520
 in a group of 12 but a visa te qui tavano 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.709
 I don't know if it was day but day 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.360
 or less then I have not had time for 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.789
 try it last time he did it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.739
 really put in much less around 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.959
 three days I did everything so I don't have 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.520
 had these problems but this time it is 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.229
 so I'll see if I can do it for you 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.700
 but for a special one, here it is 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.130
 however, those who use the boys of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.070
 usual for all against all in use a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 a little more elaborate by example 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.810
 grave silence fixed but in short 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.160
 these are details that I do n't want 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 speak well in this video also because 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.250
 will not be able to tell you that now 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.280
 a well- groomed class since it still isn't 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.660
 just the names of why you guys excuse me 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.300
 if at this moment I will call them back 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 still with the names of black ops 2 but mi 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.420
 so here comes first of all me 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.350
 that for closed fast extraction is up 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.600
 smg that its wrong seeds would be le 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 machine guns r would be assault rifle 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.080
 then the assault rifle 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.020
 yes i know the quick draw would go 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.910
 used to study while for smc 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.260
 therefore readiness should be used 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.790
 this is already something you can 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.440
 change I don't like making videos 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.810
 on the classes because they are very much 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.400
 very personal however I use it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 always in the fast station and therefore if 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.440
 you want my precise class is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.000
 this quick extraction test well 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.239
 obviously concentration in the mind in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.550
 all classes then as you see in 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.590
 in this case I had the third bonus then 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.330
 I didn't use inflexible immediately, not 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.610
 I put in the third good while the usual ones 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.620
 use also inflexible game of 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
 prestige that unlike the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.890
 competitive online I need a lot 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.390
 especially when I have to turn in the middle 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.299
 in the meantime this spawn that class 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.560
 which I use for facebook trap then that 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.150
 what I use environmental perception 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.430
 amplification I don't remember well how 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.230
 it is called the ghost pass because precisely 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.820
 having some headphones too 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.049
 good for those who always ask that is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.730
 your 50 I like to use of 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.480
 because they make me feel even better 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.040
 of what I can already feel and then 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.030
 use has entered a ba when 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.769
 that is when I use the third 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.840
 bonus or think of grave or shield here 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.450
 given depends on the lobbies I find of 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.130
 usually co2 classes more or less similar and if 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.930
 it is true that in that lab it explodes 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.450
 of everything I put the one with shield 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.209
 armored because you see them as a specialist 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.549
 there is a jackal as the first center 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.230
 perfect as according to the third void o 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.180
 less depending on you use inflexible 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.330
 first and then instead in the bonus of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.380
 unpleasant use always 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.550
 light beyond the limit now not me 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.090
 I remember how they are called mi 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.610
 sorry agility seems to me and marathon though 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.740
 I am not mistaken, and then either dead silence 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.970
 dark depending on what was missing 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.370
 first and promptness and a random bonus 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.990
 this v or not my class now not 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.480
 I know exactly if I have forgotten 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.090
 something but certainly work I did 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.310
 however this first class 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.430
 nothing seen we had a long time is me 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 liked to tell you a little at least maybe 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.280
 I will never be able to answer you 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.200
 the comments of the boys and are totally 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.760
 crafty that he has not let me down for some 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.620
 part class then all the time me 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.450
 put there to rewrite from the beginning 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.900
 that's why it weighs on me a little 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.700
 here however how you will know 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.130
 at least those who follow me already from 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.980
 so long I count on the latter 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.200
 period has almost always followed you will be 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.430
 happened to say that August 10th 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.900
 leaving on vacation from 10 to 17 I will go 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.000
 with my mother my brothers in a 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.430
 ditch now does not want to cut cuts 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.020
 because it is not a purse affair sincerely 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.810
 anyway and then from 21 to 30 with mine 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.030
 father brothers me in another place 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.900
 so I'll have to prepare the videos for 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.460
 about 20 days is something I wanted 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.840
 ask yourself then first of all I am 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.730
 trying these days to do more 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.780
 light possible in order to obviate 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.190
 this problem that will arise or 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.960
 topics to be treated because they are 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.000
 used in commentaries to talk about 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.710
 things that have happened to me recently 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080
 things that interest you things that you 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.430
 you asked but had to prepare 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.320
 about 12 comment them in 12 days or 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.140
 anyway, so 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.180
 I can't tell you what it is 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.820
 happened to 12 comment i feel also 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.520
 because you will see them with a certain one 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.410
 not all in a row and then later 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.760
 maybe comments would not hit 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.060
 not even that much 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.130
 and for once he found himself having to use 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.090
 of the arguments here I don't do it 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.350
 always 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.550
 but for example in the comments of how 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.840
 this I talked about the class 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.430
 because they are long of usual gameplay 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.140
 who propose are short bass player e 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.610
 so I never have such a problem 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.980
 they must never deal with topics 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.950
 anyway I wanted to ask you 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.390
 comments of the subjects also brief that 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.610
 they can also be treated in two or three 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.380
 minutes not necessarily things 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.850
 very long but who knows even those who 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.980
 maybe you'll find a longer video there 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.630
 I can do then I wanted to apologize 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.630
 you genetic if you said these days 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.720
 also of gameplay not too beautiful and ad 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.670
 example in spawn between pro but unfortunately 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.160
 I must also resort to those because ce 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.100
 I have many nests with the genus e 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.540
 so having to prepare 500 thousand videos 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.130
 I will also use those, however, some 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.660
 I hope to simplify business 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.340
 same so life leaving she likes how 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.710
 write together the same thing as one 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.190
 facebook page of the finished boy hi 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.190
 to all
