00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
see in the bottom left hand corner

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.899 
see in the bottom left hand corner
there's<00:00:52.589> a<00:00:52.649> timer<00:00:52.949> obviously<00:00:53.550> you're<00:00:53.670> trying

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
there's a timer obviously you're trying

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.660 
there's a timer obviously you're trying
to<00:00:53.969> beat<00:00:54.229> your<00:00:55.229> best<00:00:55.559> time<00:00:55.979> I<00:00:56.280> joined<00:00:56.339> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to beat your best time I joined this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450 
to beat your best time I joined this
game<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.909> little<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.239> late<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.280> we're<00:00:59.280> already

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
game a little bit late so we're already

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.419 
game a little bit late so we're already
two<00:00:59.729> minutes<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> 15<00:01:00.420> seconds<00:01:00.749> into<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.289> game

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
two minutes and 15 seconds into the game

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.219 
two minutes and 15 seconds into the game
so<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.579> idea<00:01:02.999> is<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.389> to<00:01:03.899> kill

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so the idea is to to kill

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.060 
so the idea is to to kill
computer-controlled<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.360> AI<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> they're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
computer-controlled the AI and they're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
computer-controlled the AI and they're
holding<00:01:08.759> points<00:01:09.509> it's<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.259> like<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
holding points it's kind of like a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.139 
holding points it's kind of like a
capture<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.950> flag<00:01:11.040> type<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.700> thing<00:01:11.880> with

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
capture the flag type of thing with

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.289 
capture the flag type of thing with
computer<00:01:12.899> AI<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.820> friends

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
computer AI so you and for friends

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.039 
computer AI so you and for friends
cooperatively<00:01:16.820> play<00:01:17.820> through<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> capture

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
cooperatively play through and capture

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
cooperatively play through and capture
these<00:01:19.170> points<00:01:19.619> trying<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> beat<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.369> best

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
these points trying to beat your best

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.279 
these points trying to beat your best
time<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.840> by<00:01:22.140> far<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:23.280> strategic

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
time this by far is the most strategic

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.590 
time this by far is the most strategic
mode<00:01:25.289> in<00:01:25.560> battlefield<00:01:26.549> obviously<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
mode in battlefield obviously the the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
mode in battlefield obviously the the
campaign<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.710> fun<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.549> necessarily

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
campaign is is fun not necessarily

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.920 
campaign is is fun not necessarily
strategic<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.890> there's<00:01:32.820> an<00:01:32.909> easy<00:01:33.509> level

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
strategic but this there's an easy level

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
strategic but this there's an easy level
a<00:01:33.990> medium<00:01:34.289> level<00:01:34.320> hard<00:01:34.799> level<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.820> hardest

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
a medium level hard level on the hardest

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
a medium level hard level on the hardest
level<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.320> tough<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.859> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
level is really really tough and you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
level is really really tough and you
have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.219> really<00:01:38.490> strategic<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.390> your

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have to be really strategic with your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.740 
there's some network issues there's a
little<00:03:27.580> bit<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.790> lag<00:03:28.000> there's<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.420> little<00:03:28.570> bit

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
little bit of lag there's a little bit

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.479 
little bit of lag there's a little bit
of<00:03:28.810> maybe<00:03:29.350> you'll<00:03:29.530> walk<00:03:29.709> into<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:29.980> building<00:03:30.160> and

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
of maybe you'll walk into a building and

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.729 
of maybe you'll walk into a building and
then<00:03:30.610> you'll<00:03:30.930> transport<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.260> or<00:03:32.470> something

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
then you'll transport out or something

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.680 
then you'll transport out or something
like<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:33.220> that's<00:03:33.400> normal<00:03:33.970> online<00:03:34.360> stuff

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
game this games a lot of fun and it's a

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.350 
game this games a lot of fun and it's a
lot<00:03:53.860> better<00:03:54.010> than<00:03:54.250> than<00:03:54.610> modern<00:03:54.940> warfare<00:03:55.180> I

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
lot better than than modern warfare I

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.320 
lot better than than modern warfare I
think<00:03:55.780> one<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.770> two<00:03:56.920> by<00:03:57.190> far<00:03:57.520> there's<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.300> lot

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
think one and two by far there's a lot

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.750 
think one and two by far there's a lot
more<00:03:58.510> fun<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.350> way<00:03:59.500> things<00:03:59.560> explode<00:04:00.280> and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
more fun that the way things explode and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.640 
more fun that the way things explode and
I<00:04:01.300> think<00:04:01.510> that's<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.720> really<00:04:01.750> cool<00:04:02.110> aspect<00:04:02.530> of

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
I think that's a really cool aspect of

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.680 
I think that's a really cool aspect of
the<00:04:02.709> game<00:04:02.739> but<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.610> onslaught<00:04:04.150> mode<00:04:04.209> back<00:04:04.540> to

what we're talking about is is just a

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.520 
what we're talking about is is just a
quick<00:04:07.450> way<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.630> play<00:04:07.870> with<00:04:08.020> friends<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.410> don't
