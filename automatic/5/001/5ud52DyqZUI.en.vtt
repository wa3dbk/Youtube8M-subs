00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.690
 we are interested in what we are going to do 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.640
 which is bread with tomato or bread tumaca 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.380
 computers we choose the fine not because 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 will cause a lot of water in the flesh of 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.270
 tomato I leave a thick grater very well 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.710
 we split the tomato to proceed to 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.140
 gratify what you have here 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.270
 house that pulp we get without water like 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.890
 I told you and with a body the best for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.710
 make bread with tomato let's 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.300
 reserve it 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.730
 good and this is the bread that we are going to use 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.250
 you see that bread is a seed of bread 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.500
 with tomato you need us to use a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.540
 good bread stuffed in flour a rustic bread 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.769
 because it will be much richer good 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 these are the bread artists with 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.640
 tomato mouse salt salt of course oil 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.790
 olive bread 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.960
 the optional setting and the grated tomato 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.600
 we started let's go with it well we put the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.060
 olive oil in the tomato and look at a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.130
 we mix this and we would have 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.850
 in the refrigerator this possibility of 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.429
 when we want to make bread with tomato 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.600
 It will be much more comfortable and easier because 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.250
 Well, for several reasons 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.780
 see if the tomatoes are already ripe and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.340
 we do the scratching they will not pass us 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.500
 also seen is much cleaner than 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.000
 frontal on the bread direct the oil 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.340
 prevents oxidation of tomato and on the other 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.830
 'side can not use the tomato pulp 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
 does not give off water come let's try 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.280
 a little bit of garlic in the bread I told them 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.649
 which is optional to me yes I like 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 a lot but there are people who do not 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.179
 edges we rub and then we put the pulp 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.580
 of the tomato in the center of the lo 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.020
 we stretch a little you see that go 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.659
 entering the friend 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.729
 the seed bread and we can be the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.060
 little bit of saleh before, not because I insist 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.560
 makes the tomato throw water very well 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.329
 well this is bread with tomato or bread 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 tumaca that serves as the basis for a 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.140
 lots of tapas tapas or canapÃ©s 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.689
 you want to create a utility if it comes 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.219
 Look at some slices of Serrano ham that 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.310
 let's do with them well let's 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.910
 try to make some flowers to put them 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.560
 about this extraordinary bread with tomato 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.560
 You see, all I do is roll up a 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.840
 little bit at the beginning and then go doing 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 a kind of spiral with the slice of 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.209
 ham trying to move acceleration 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.040
 and lower than it would be the flower or the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.310
 pink as you want to call it good from 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 another angle for you to see it you see double 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.530
 a little bit at the beginning the edge and then 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 already on the roll and I'm moving 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.959
 until the bottom to the end of what 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.690
 would be the flower the one small base and here 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.970
 we have the ham on top 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.829
 of the bread tumaca to see what we owe 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.359
 do the flowers the important thing is to put 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.590
 the ham that if you want to stretch it like 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.099
 a slice follows a cow tongue 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.500
 but with the ham and good we put 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.050
 the third flower and we already have these three 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.750
 bites of glory and good then here 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.790
 you have a canapÃ© a skewer a cover like 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.220
 you want to call this extraordinary 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.900

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.900
