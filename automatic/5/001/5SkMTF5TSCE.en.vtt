00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.970
 a new interior renderer of Cinema 4d 11 points five added 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.540
 Feature is the conversion from the earlier Rendell a rendering 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.409
 leave on the floor 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.999
 what do you mean with that 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.360
 if I have started a rendering of a previous version 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.950
 so became dependent on a number of processor cores such a Linder Enderlein 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.710
 In my case, these are two processor cores and they now see that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 rendered here in two sections 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.780
 Haye this one has been finished had the next piece stopped 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.190
 and so on 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 as I said in the version 11 percent 5 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.500
 Cinema 4d has now replaced this rendering method 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 so-called backed riots 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.290
 Michel is here now starting such a race to see the city 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.490
 The line now depends on two important areas again depending on the number of mine 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.400
 Processor can show up 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.230
 These parts also work again and look for a complete picture 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.380
 put together 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.080
 The advantage of using this cheek goal is that this one is after those 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.430
 Performance and depending on memory on division vary in size 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.270
 These can be first of all automatically from 10 MWp to the eleven good five 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.940
 set 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.970
 but can also be adjusted 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.960
 is one of these areas and question he gives the store accordingly as far as he 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.800
 It can be free again and so I can also use very memory-intensive scenes seers 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 convert have these waiting times 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 The one hour to find the usual in a full position 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 the rubric «options» click below the possibility of size 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 to adjust the bagels 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 in the case of the automatic size picture chosen an optimal size 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.940
 but you can also specify your own size 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.010
 It's pretty easy 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.380
 that is the little wobbly 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.790
 are you less memory needed this 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 the larger parquet is 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 Rendered faster with this mostly but also that need more memory 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.869
 So if you have messages, the input memory is not enough 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.310
 Scene to Race There are in many cases this cheek Zampach too 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.399
 decrease 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.519
 You also have the option up here the so-called Backed 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.319
 Order to set 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.650
 usually room ends up for those out of the center 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.889
 because there is in most cases what they are interested 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.279
 depending on the picture that could of course be in another place and 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.219
 sometimes that is not wrong 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.499
 to switch any scene here, for example, from left to right 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.499
 that would then go out like this 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 So STEMI Well so with in the package Rande rings 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.469
 improved rendering ridden available
