00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.319
 Yes is a Hi cedar Hiro very much this time do my best with the aim first place in the high pixel server 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.549
 I will 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.549
 Until it starts 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.450
 Now let's lightly explain the rules 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.130
 At the beginning of the game, you will be given a mouth and you will be able to fly missiles with right click 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 I will match the other party 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.680
 If it hurts , it will be 1 point and the person with the most points at the end will win 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.260
 It is followed by the main game now in third place when I have a sword It is currently 5 say 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:39.820
 Let's write the current rank above the time being good I re p main easier to understand in this 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:45.130
 Please note that is quite extreme clumsiness because rarely Nante pvp 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.950
 It is dangerous What there is is Yappa difficult What Deya Ninen people hey the 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.790
 I've dropped to 5th place when I notice 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.690
 Yes p The Lord's weaknesses are transmitted well 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.990
 2 consecutive kills Well I'm going up from here 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.530
 Hmm 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.250
 If you notice it is already my brother, the difference from the 1st place is only 1 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.160
 This If the stand-go there finally my mines mother is 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.840
 Opinion You can understand that you will fall down if you get in a good condition that Ai Ai's big victory 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.980
 How to even this brother was defeated A'a now re p main Tsu want outright protect guy 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 Something other than 1st guy 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.710
 Be prepared to take the place of the first place as soon as you are stunned 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 Where's Where reluctant'll this I have to apology 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 So there is a certainty Dani who has grown up, and is it safe? 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.970
 Point difference between the 1-position can go if still 1 Chapter Keru this or Te 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.240
 I'm not good at it yet 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.090
 Goal change when it's too late to finish 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.770
 It was not a good self-mastering condition that was protecting the brother 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:53.060
 The difference between the difference in third place that is a 4 of the Kusso Oh first place is still there is also a 4 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:58.460
 He seems to be able to become a brother unless he loses his head, but he immediately got rid of it 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:03.229
 Moreover, he was the first-place guy, and this game is fun too. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.080
 Is the person Majlis to make pvp is by I like this for fun rather than is likely chai and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.910
 The 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 I think it will end soon, but let's go around rampantly until the end 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 What Kaike Well do it will Kana seriously let's aim point 20 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:24.230
 Nikki spear it easily and is hidden in Anna Toko 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:28.430
 Oh guy in the first place is is not work hard also out Yeah I awesome seeds achieved 20 points 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.620
 I wish I could make such a phrase even with vanilla, but it looks really fun 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.620
 I tried to do that mod 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.319
 Ow no I do not either and the way to attack you are talking 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:48.980
 All right Taneu p Lord of the order ended when I say Nante still over Oh is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.980
 I 'm sorry I was not the first place but it was fun enough
