00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.820
 it is best weather on friday afternoon 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.600
 and yes never are personal again today 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.399
 in the water on the way 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 we are to a small canal in the 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.640
 drove close and will try now 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.040
 phase to drive probably 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.330
 smallpox lure around her and fish 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.750
 if we're lucky enough to demand it 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.430
 bait 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.900
 you are there we show you as always 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.400
 how we do it and see you 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.690
 if there is the first fish later 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.940
 a few little words to ours 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.510
 the channel gets into the vision it 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.860
 really two three feet wide 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.449
 we fish with very little baits and 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.089
 That's why we have a very short one 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.050
 Failed route with the book weight of 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.589
 two to eight grams 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.149
 that's in the case of determining mac pro 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.100
 I like to fish the route very much 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 For two, she has one 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.559
 Super 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.210
 A super action point action is very 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.739
 Sensitive that means I can the small ones 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.499
 toss children and to the other she is 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.089
 a very cheap route for me 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.199
 When fishing and trout fishing that 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.329
 Practically , I'm not that true 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.789
 I also have a small one 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.459
 Thousands of stationary roll on that 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.829
 again a very cheap model 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.810
 the little shimano xt everyone 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.270
 can recommend the role has one 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.729
 super brake works great too 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 a super lightweight cord on 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.770
 i played little nano 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.390
 a lot there you can do well a thin one 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.270
 braided take is important but that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.619
 the stretching sun is one with it so far 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.359
 as a runner I use today we are 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.440
 it also a live luca wish only me 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.830
 believes its diameter of 0 20 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.250
 then the little jack weighs 17 degrees 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.430
 is an extranet and the little rubber 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 fish in the fall ct shirt in 5 cm 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 So you can join the industry very well 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.960
 fishing 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.049
 No 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.340
 the first bus got in 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.340
 looking for paper under the bridge for a long time 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 part 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.040
 first choice 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.689
 with the small channel really horny 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.689
 animal always beautiful 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.740
 here 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.660
 you see gummitwist well taken 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.340
 the small city world in this case still 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.920
 thank you, no, I'm always the dirk 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.640
 to send again 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.640
 resistors 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.300
 only the next one fresh 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.030
 is getting slow of bad weather 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.880
 Thunderstorm in a suit 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.880
 a spinner changed and that takes 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.450
 that we under 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.670
 Thank you very much 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.009
 so a graduation is right before that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.490
 thunderstorms are classic on the spinner 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.490
 hazards 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:56.030
 the channel will not get much bigger 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:58.370
 so that she stood up there on the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.780
 Bridge where he loves to have parts of the picture 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.370
 the whole side players we have seen 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.810
 then go and then shot under these 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.010
 very much covered my hands 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.010
 that's enough 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.750
 Seen the first position she said 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.750
 I would not calculate my computer 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.899
 the boys hurry 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.899
 how is that? 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.210
 so that probably already loads behind 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.220
 me she can pretty much be upset 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.440
 and how did I prefer my home one 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.210
 hour we could clearly have with 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.970
 help young children was able to save 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.070
 and redeem yourself satisfied 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.160
 a short trip before so to the next 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.160
 times
