test number two when i turn the key I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.200 
test number two when i turn the key I
don't<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.660> start<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.410> honest<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.939> I

because<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.700> an<00:00:41.820> indicator<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.360> cold

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
because that's an indicator of how cold

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.150 
because that's an indicator of how cold
is<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:43.020> here

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.940 

yep<00:00:47.060> started<00:00:47.780> up<00:00:48.460> she's<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.489> champ<00:00:50.950> she's

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
yep started up she's a champ she's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.150 
yep started up she's a champ she's
running<00:00:52.220> like<00:00:52.310> crap<00:00:52.580> though<00:00:52.640> tell<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.239> that

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
running like crap though tell you that

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.290 
running like crap though tell you that
quarter<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.280> tank<00:00:55.400> of<00:00:55.520> gas<00:00:55.700> too<00:00:56.030> it's

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
quarter of a tank of gas too it's

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.640 
quarter of a tank of gas too it's
probably<00:00:56.420> part<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.870> reason<00:00:56.930> almost

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
probably part of the reason almost

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.020 
probably part of the reason almost
90,000<00:00:58.520> miles<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:59.030> 26<00:00:59.480> degrees<00:00:59.900> out<00:01:00.080> there

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
90,000 miles it's 26 degrees out there

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.689 
90,000 miles it's 26 degrees out there
she<00:01:02.030> started<00:01:02.330> right<00:01:02.510> up<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:04.309> she<00:01:04.550> actually

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
she started right up and she actually

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.100 
she started right up and she actually
needs<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:05.030> new<00:01:05.119> battery<00:01:05.300> on<00:01:05.570> top<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.080> so

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
needs a new battery on top of it so

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.469 
needs a new battery on top of it so
that's<00:01:07.010> pretty<00:01:07.280> damn<00:01:07.490> impressive<00:01:07.700> engine

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
that's pretty damn impressive engine

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.420 
that's pretty damn impressive engine
needs<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.690> PCV<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:09.560> I'll<00:01:10.550> take<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.190> just<00:01:13.190> get

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430

needs a PCV so I'll take it now just get
food<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:13.940> pin<00:01:14.300> drive<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.750> let<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.020> warm<00:01:15.170> up<00:01:15.430> I'll

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
food so pin drive it let it warm up I'll

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.590 
food so pin drive it let it warm up I'll
let<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.670> battery<00:01:16.850> charge<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.240> little<00:01:17.479> bit

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
let the battery charge a little bit

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.510 
let the battery charge a little bit
hopefully<00:01:18.259> you'll<00:01:18.830> be<00:01:18.890> able<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.130> hear<00:01:19.220> this

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
hopefully you'll be able to hear this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.060 
hopefully you'll be able to hear this
but<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.869> something<00:01:21.080> nasty<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
but I have something nasty going on the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:36.940 
but I have something nasty going on the
front<00:01:22.340> end<00:01:22.520> suspension

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.830 

I<00:01:37.009> think<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.820> can<00:01:37.939> probably<00:01:37.969> i<00:01:38.360> think<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
I think you can probably i think the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.170 
I think you can probably i think the
camera<00:01:39.170> will<00:01:39.289> pick<00:01:39.320> up<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.710> sound<00:01:40.039> but<00:01:40.280> i'm

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
camera will pick up that sound but i'm

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.499 
camera will pick up that sound but i'm
pretty<00:01:41.600> sure<00:01:41.750> i<00:01:42.880> know<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.090> something<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.420> my

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
pretty sure i know it's something in my

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.760 
pretty sure i know it's something in my
front<00:01:44.689> suspension<00:01:45.229> i<00:01:45.320> really<00:01:45.530> had<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.740> time

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
front suspension i really had the time

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.919 
front suspension i really had the time
to<00:01:45.950> look<00:01:46.159> at<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.549> but<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.939> sounds<00:01:47.149> ugly<00:01:47.509> it

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
to look at it but it sounds ugly it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.350 
to look at it but it sounds ugly it
feels<00:01:48.320> really<00:01:48.439> ugly<00:01:48.820> it's<00:01:49.820> only<00:01:50.000> at<00:01:50.210> low

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
feels really ugly it's only at low

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.419 
feels really ugly it's only at low
speeds<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.020> it's<00:01:51.110> only<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.649> cold<00:01:51.920> so

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
speeds and it's only when it's cold so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.429 
speeds and it's only when it's cold so
it<00:01:52.759> could<00:01:53.000> be<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.119> bushing<00:01:53.509> problem<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:53.990> really

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
it could be a bushing problem I really

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.350 
it could be a bushing problem I really
don't<00:01:54.619> know<00:01:54.700> probably<00:01:55.700> going<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:55.970> find<00:01:56.090> out

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
don't know probably going to find out

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.059 
don't know probably going to find out
and<00:01:57.020> when<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.200> find<00:01:57.530> out<00:01:57.649> I'll<00:01:57.710> let<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.039> know

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
and when I find out I'll let you know

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.749 
and when I find out I'll let you know
but<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.479> car<00:01:59.689> needs<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.140> bit<00:02:00.289> of<00:02:00.350> work

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
but the car needs a little bit of work

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.910 
but the car needs a little bit of work
which<00:02:01.759> I'll<00:02:01.909> get<00:02:02.030> around<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:03.439> next<00:02:03.710> couple

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
which I'll get around to the next couple

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.090 
which I'll get around to the next couple
of<00:02:04.069> months<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.210> um<00:02:05.500> just<00:02:06.500> want<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.770> see<00:02:06.890> if<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
of months but um just want to see if I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.350

unusual<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:16.209> even<00:02:17.209> though<00:02:17.269> every<00:02:17.450> place

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
unusual because even though every place

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.490 
unusual because even though every place
the<00:02:17.840> vano<00:02:18.049> seals<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.829> once<00:02:19.160> i<00:02:20.500> replace

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the vano seals on this once i replace

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.680 
the vano seals on this once i replace
them<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.860> OEM<00:02:22.280> seals<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.120> they're

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
them with the OEM seals and they're

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.960 
them with the OEM seals and they're
starting<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.019> fail<00:02:24.260> again<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.459> fact<00:02:25.700> i<00:02:25.849> was

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
starting to fail again so the fact i was

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.210 
starting to fail again so the fact i was
able<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.209> set<00:02:26.329> idle<00:02:26.780> 26<00:02:27.410> degrees<00:02:27.769> without<00:02:27.980> any

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
able to set idle 26 degrees without any

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.089 
able to set idle 26 degrees without any
kind<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.549> surging<00:02:29.319> not<00:02:30.319> too<00:02:30.500> bad<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:33.099> yeah

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
kind of surging not too bad so yeah
