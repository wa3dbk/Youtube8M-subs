hello guys welcome back I'm minecraft
dummies<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.480> today<00:00:09.809> what<00:00:10.019> I've<00:00:10.080> got<00:00:10.230> for<00:00:10.290> you

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
dummies and today what I've got for you

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.860 
dummies and today what I've got for you
is<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> super<00:00:11.130> flat<00:00:11.370> minecart<00:00:11.820> station<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.780> you

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
is a super flat minecart station so you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.879 
is a super flat minecart station so you
simply<00:00:13.019> step<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> pressure<00:00:13.710> plate

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
simply step on the pressure plate

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.499 
simply step on the pressure plate
getting<00:00:14.759> your<00:00:14.910> minecart

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
getting your minecart

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.290 
getting your minecart
tap<00:00:16.379> forward<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.920> then<00:00:17.039> you're<00:00:17.190> off<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.090> then

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
tap forward and then you're off and then

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929 
tap forward and then you're off and then
come<00:00:19.140> back<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> station<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.760> see

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
come back to the station as you can see

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.880 
come back to the station as you can see
you'll<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.240> taken<00:00:21.539> off<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
you'll get taken off and then the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.480 
you'll get taken off and then the
minecart<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.609> stored<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.570> later<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> as

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
minecart will be stored for later so as

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.410 
minecart will be stored for later so as
you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.880> doesn't<00:00:27.029> matter<00:00:27.240> actually

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you can see it doesn't matter actually

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.390 
you can see it doesn't matter actually
when<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> come<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> station<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:29.310> will

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
when I come into the station it will

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.009 
when I come into the station it will
actually<00:00:29.699> always<00:00:29.849> take<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.420> minecart<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
actually always take my minecart and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.410 
actually always take my minecart and
keep<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> dispenser<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.910> later<00:00:33.059> use

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
keep it in the dispenser for later use

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
keep it in the dispenser for later use
so<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> come<00:00:34.290> back<00:00:34.380> over<00:00:34.559> here

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so when I come back over here

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
so when I come back over here
I<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.670> step<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.059> pressure<00:00:36.300> plate<00:00:36.620> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
I can step on this pressure plate it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
I can step on this pressure plate it
will<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.860> my<00:00:38.070> Enquirer<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.610> me<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.149> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
will put my Enquirer out for me and it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.850 
will put my Enquirer out for me and it
will<00:00:39.420> stay<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.870> long<00:00:40.020> until<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
will stay out as long until I get on it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.840 
will stay out as long until I get on it
and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.969> soon<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.069 

so<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> beauty<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.359> is<00:00:49.570> it's<00:00:49.780> obviously

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
so the beauty of this is it's obviously

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.930 
so the beauty of this is it's obviously
super<00:00:50.469> flat<00:00:50.649> so<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.370> only<00:00:51.489> thing<00:00:51.670> sticking

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
super flat so the only thing sticking

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.090 
super flat so the only thing sticking
out<00:00:52.090> are<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.329> rails<00:00:52.539> and<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.079> pressure<00:00:53.859> plate

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
out are the rails and the pressure plate

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.209 
out are the rails and the pressure plate
and<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.539> can<00:00:55.659> see<00:00:55.780> now<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:57.070> all<00:00:57.100> the

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
and as you can see now when all the

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.439 
and as you can see now when all the
blocks<00:00:57.550> have<00:00:57.670> been<00:00:57.699> removed<00:00:58.030> there<00:00:58.269> really

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
blocks have been removed there really

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.630 
blocks have been removed there really
isn't<00:00:58.659> much<00:00:58.750> redstone<00:00:59.289> it<00:00:59.829> fits<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.430> wide

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
isn't much redstone it fits in a to wide

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.030 
isn't much redstone it fits in a to wide
space<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.229> fudge<00:01:02.229> a<00:01:02.260> swing<00:01:02.559> round<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.949> can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
space and fudge a swing round you can

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.730 
space and fudge a swing round you can
see<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.489> really<00:01:03.760> really<00:01:04.149> is<00:01:04.320> quite<00:01:05.320> small<00:01:05.680> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
see it really really is quite small and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.719 
see it really really is quite small and
very<00:01:06.159> easy<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.610> build<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.220> now<00:01:09.340> let's<00:01:09.520> get<00:01:09.640> on

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
very easy to build so now let's get on

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.930 
very easy to build so now let's get on
with<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.909> tutorial<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.580> build<00:01:15.729> one<00:01:15.909> of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
with the tutorial so to build one of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.800 
with the tutorial so to build one of
these<00:01:16.060> you're<00:01:16.180> going<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.360> need<00:01:16.479> two

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
these you're going to need two

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.060 
these you're going to need two
dispensers<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.649> make<00:01:17.830> sure<00:01:17.920> their

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
dispensers and that make sure their

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.070 
dispensers and that make sure their
dispensers<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.759> not<00:01:18.880> droppers<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.450> lava

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
dispensers and not droppers a lava

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.050 
dispensers and not droppers a lava
bucket<00:01:20.530> forwards<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.460> torches<00:01:21.789> two

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
detector rail and then three powered

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.180 
detector rail and then three powered
rails<00:01:28.420> on<00:01:28.780> top<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> other<00:01:29.860> ones<00:01:30.039> that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
rails on top of the other ones that

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.820 
rails on top of the other ones that
you'll<00:01:30.310> need<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:31.000> get<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.649> minecart<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
you'll need to get the minecart to the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.210 
you'll need to get the minecart to the
correct<00:01:33.069> position<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:34.440> pressure<00:01:35.440> plate<00:01:35.590> two

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
correct position a pressure plate two

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.620 
correct position a pressure plate two
hoppers<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:36.670> then<00:01:36.819> obviously<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.210> minecart

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
hoppers and then obviously a minecart

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.309 
hoppers and then obviously a minecart
for<00:01:37.899> traveling<00:01:38.319> so<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.840> start<00:01:41.140> with<00:01:41.229> you're

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
for traveling so to start with you're

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.529 
for traveling so to start with you're
going<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.470> need<00:01:41.619> your<00:01:41.860> rail<00:01:42.819> in<00:01:43.090> coming<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
going to need your rail in coming to the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.070 
going to need your rail in coming to the
station<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.440> needs<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.740> be<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:45.130> series<00:01:45.819> of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
station and this needs to be a series of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.979 
station and this needs to be a series of
seven<00:01:47.080> or<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.350> powered<00:01:47.679> rails<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.069> row

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
seven or so powered rails in a row

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.119 
seven or so powered rails in a row
you'll<00:01:49.989> see<00:01:50.080> when<00:01:50.379> it<00:01:50.470> works<00:01:50.679> because<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:51.129 
you'll see when it works because the

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.150 
you'll see when it works because the
minecart<00:01:51.610> will<00:01:51.840> obviously<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:53.440> destroyed<00:01:53.920> and

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
minecart will obviously be destroyed and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.790 
minecart will obviously be destroyed and
fall<00:01:54.970> off<00:01:55.119> into<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.539> hoppers<00:01:56.289> if<00:01:56.440> working

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
fall off into the hoppers if working

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.169 
fall off into the hoppers if working
correctly<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.429> won't<00:01:57.640> get<00:01:57.849> burned<00:01:58.060> by

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
correctly and you won't get burned by

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.260 
correctly and you won't get burned by
the<00:01:58.239> lava<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.590> eight<00:01:59.860> always<00:02:00.250> works<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.789> you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the lava so eight always works and you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.389 
the lava so eight always works and you
can<00:02:01.300> always<00:02:01.509> experiment<00:02:02.259> yourself<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.890> see<00:02:03.069> if

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
can always experiment yourself to see if

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.400 
can always experiment yourself to see if
the<00:02:03.849> amount<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.270> have<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.450> work<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.379> I

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
the amount that you have a work but I

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.440 
the amount that you have a work but I
would<00:02:05.649> advise<00:02:05.890> eight<00:02:06.129> so<00:02:07.060> at<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.179> end<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.390> this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
would advise eight so at the end of this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.669 
would advise eight so at the end of this
you're<00:02:07.599> gonna<00:02:07.690> go<00:02:07.840> over<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:07.989> pattern<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.379> one

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
you're gonna go over the pattern of one

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.520 
you're gonna go over the pattern of one
unpowered<00:02:09.280> rail<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.950> empowered<00:02:12.310> rail<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
unpowered rail then one empowered rail a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.369 
unpowered rail then one empowered rail a
detector<00:02:14.530> rail<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:15.810> regular<00:02:16.810> rail<00:02:16.959> again<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
detector rail a regular rail again and

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.740 
detector rail a regular rail again and
then<00:02:17.650> an<00:02:17.800> activator<00:02:18.250> rail<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.970> order<00:02:19.269> so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
then an activator rail and that order so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.390 
then an activator rail and that order so
like<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.739> you're<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.129> get<00:02:21.190> one

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
like that now you're going to get one

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.630 
like that now you're going to get one
regular<00:02:21.790> rail<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:23.650> three<00:02:24.250> blocks<00:02:24.489> in

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
regular rail and then three blocks in

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.600 
regular rail and then three blocks in
front<00:02:24.670> you're<00:02:24.910> gonna<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.269> destroy<00:02:25.599> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
front you're gonna have to destroy and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.309 
front you're gonna have to destroy and
then<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.450> third<00:02:28.629> one<00:02:28.810> long<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.080> put<00:02:29.260> a

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
then and the third one long you put a

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.430 
then and the third one long you put a
dispenser<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.420> put<00:02:31.660> two<00:02:31.930> hoppers

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
dispenser and then you put two hoppers

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.050 
dispenser and then you put two hoppers
going<00:02:33.010> into<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:34.980> dispenser<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
going into the dispenser so like so you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
going into the dispenser so like so you
can<00:02:37.120> see<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.450> they're<00:02:37.599> facing<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.260> towards

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
can see that they're facing in towards

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.650 
can see that they're facing in towards
the<00:02:38.890> dispenser<00:02:39.430> they've<00:02:40.060> done<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.540> want

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the dispenser they've done this you want

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.960 
the dispenser they've done this you want
to<00:02:40.720> build<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.080> curve<00:02:41.470> around<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.860> side<00:02:42.040> so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
to build the curve around the side so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.130 
to build the curve around the side so
you're<00:02:43.060> going<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.300> get<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.510> dispenser<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you're going to get your dispenser and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.699 
you're going to get your dispenser and
place<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.470> facing<00:02:44.860> upwards<00:02:45.190> next<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
place it facing upwards next to this and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.720 
place it facing upwards next to this and
then<00:02:47.709> you're<00:02:47.860> gonna<00:02:47.950> curve<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> rail<00:02:48.610> around

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
then you're gonna curve the rail around

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.670 
then you're gonna curve the rail around
like<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:49.810> regular<00:02:50.019> rail<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.560> can

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
like that with regular rail so you can

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.500 
like that with regular rail so you can
see<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.890> get<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> curve<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.459> now<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.120> put

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
see you get the curve and now you put

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.840 
see you get the curve and now you put
the<00:02:52.629> powered<00:02:53.290> rails<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.590> afterwards<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.310> as

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
the powered rails on afterwards and as

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.100 
the powered rails on afterwards and as
you<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.270> they<00:02:55.510> will<00:02:55.690> stay<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.020> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you can see they will stay in the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.960 
you can see they will stay in the
correct<00:02:56.350> positions<00:02:56.710> so<00:02:57.310> now<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.730> remove

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
correct positions so now you can remove

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.760 
correct positions so now you can remove
this<00:02:58.180> piece<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:58.990> unnecessary

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
this piece as that is unnecessary

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.890 
this piece as that is unnecessary
and<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.640> keep<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.970> rail<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.780> it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
and this is just to keep the rail so it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.720 
and this is just to keep the rail so it
curves<00:03:02.170> off<00:03:02.350> towards<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.830> lava<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.640> you've

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
curves off towards the lava now you've

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.550 
curves off towards the lava now you've
got<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:03.970> layout<00:03:04.300> set<00:03:04.630> up<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.320> on<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
got this layout set up it's on to the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.620 
got this layout set up it's on to the
redstone<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.550> if<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.760> can't<00:03:07.000> follow<00:03:07.150> from<00:03:07.450> my

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
redstone so if you can't follow from my

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.060 
redstone so if you can't follow from my
tutorial<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.140> I'm<00:03:08.230> about<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.410> give<00:03:08.620> his

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
tutorial that I'm about to give his

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.680 
tutorial that I'm about to give his
little<00:03:09.400> flyby<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.060> shows<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.450> all<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
little flyby and it shows you all the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.140 
little flyby and it shows you all the
Redstone<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.610> where<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.760> placed<00:03:12.910> because

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
Redstone and where it's placed because

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.420 
Redstone and where it's placed because
it's<00:03:13.270> only<00:03:13.390> too<00:03:13.660> wide<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:15.100> start<00:03:15.340> with

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
it's only too wide so to start with

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.470 
it's only too wide so to start with
you're<00:03:15.520> going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.700> go<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> your<00:03:15.970> detector<00:03:16.330> rail

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
you're going to go to your detector rail

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.860 
you're going to go to your detector rail
go<00:03:16.960> one<00:03:17.140> block<00:03:17.290> below<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.390> then<00:03:19.630> from<00:03:19.840> that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
go one block below it and then from that

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.330 
go one block below it and then from that
block<00:03:20.140> take<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.530> one<00:03:20.680> block<00:03:20.800> further<00:03:21.040> down

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
block take it one block further down

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.630 
block take it one block further down
like<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.650> these<00:03:23.770> pieces<00:03:24.040> are<00:03:24.310> both<00:03:24.430> gonna

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
like so now these pieces are both gonna

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.180 
like so now these pieces are both gonna
have<00:03:24.730> redstone<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.770> goes<00:03:26.920> into

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
have redstone on and this one goes into

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.240 
have redstone on and this one goes into
a<00:03:27.220> block<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> redstone<00:03:28.420> torch<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.250> and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
a block with a redstone torch on it and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.000 
a block with a redstone torch on it and
then<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.150> goes<00:03:31.390> with<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:31.990> block<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.410> top<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.860> a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
then it goes with a block on top and a

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.130 
then it goes with a block on top and a
redstone<00:03:33.220> torch<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.300> side<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.020> one

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
down your minecart and and set it off

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.170 
down your minecart and and set it off
over<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.850> powered<00:04:10.120> rail<00:04:11.580> if<00:04:12.580> working

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
over the powered rail if working

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.229 
over the powered rail if working
correctly<00:04:13.420> you'll<00:04:13.720> hear<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.960> two<00:04:14.110> clicks<00:04:15.239> you

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
correctly you'll hear the two clicks you

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.520 
correctly you'll hear the two clicks you
can<00:04:16.359> now<00:04:16.480> put<00:04:16.690> your<00:04:16.750> lover<00:04:16.960> and<00:04:17.140> if<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.350> like

can now put your lover and if you like
now<00:04:18.460> to<00:04:18.520> build<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.850> minecart<00:04:19.239> dispensing<00:04:19.690> bit

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
now to build the minecart dispensing bit

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.630 
now to build the minecart dispensing bit
you'll<00:04:20.290> need<00:04:20.470> your<00:04:20.590> pressure<00:04:20.770> plate<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:21.160> that

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
you'll need your pressure plate and that

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.210 
you'll need your pressure plate and that
goes<00:04:21.850> here<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.410> one<00:04:23.410> block<00:04:23.620> behind<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:24.010> and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
goes here so one block behind it and

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.990 
goes here so one block behind it and
then<00:04:24.310> you're<00:04:24.400> gonna<00:04:24.490> go<00:04:24.670> below<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.820> put

and you go one block below and put two

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.760 
and you go one block below and put two
of<00:04:35.230> them<00:04:37.110> with<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> torch<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.590> put<00:04:38.740> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
of them with the torch you put a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.020 
of them with the torch you put a
redstone<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:40.380> from<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.530> redstone<00:04:42.190> block<00:04:42.430> you

redstone and from the redstone block you

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.110 
redstone and from the redstone block you
put<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.560> repeater<00:04:44.560> coming<00:04:44.950> out<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.220> they're

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
put a repeater coming out of it they're

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.550 
put a repeater coming out of it they're
gonna<00:04:46.210> put<00:04:46.420> these<00:04:46.540> each<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:46.990> two<00:04:47.080> blocks<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
gonna put these each in two blocks and

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.410 
gonna put these each in two blocks and
both<00:04:48.100> these<00:04:48.280> can<00:04:48.460> have<00:04:48.550> redstone<00:04:48.940> torches<00:04:49.270> on

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
both these can have redstone torches on

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.950 
both these can have redstone torches on
top<00:04:49.980> like<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:51.250> it's<00:04:51.910> very<00:04:52.060> important<00:04:52.510> that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
top like so it's very important that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.120 
top like so it's very important that
there<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.290> block<00:04:53.500> on<00:04:53.620> top<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.890> this<00:04:53.950> where

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
there is a block on top of this where

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.040 
there is a block on top of this where
it's<00:04:54.250> then<00:04:54.400> piece<00:04:54.640> your<00:04:55.360> setup<00:04:55.660> should<00:04:55.750> now<00:04:55.810> be

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
it's then piece your setup should now be

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.540 
it's then piece your setup should now be
complete<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.560> when<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.160> step<00:04:57.370> on<00:04:57.490> the

complete and when you step on the
pressure<00:04:57.760> plate<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.720> rail<00:04:59.140> should<00:04:59.380> turn<00:04:59.590> off

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
pressure plate the rail should turn off

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.160 
pressure plate the rail should turn off
and<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.370> minecart<00:05:01.330> will<00:05:01.420> come<00:05:01.540> out<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.020> is

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
and a minecart will come out and that is

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.360 
and a minecart will come out and that is
symbolized<00:05:03.040> by<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> click<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.160> can<00:05:06.280> now

won't<00:05:21.540> go<00:05:21.660> anywhere<00:05:21.840> even<00:05:22.410> if<00:05:22.500> it's<00:05:22.620> pushed

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
won't go anywhere even if it's pushed

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.460 
won't go anywhere even if it's pushed

off<00:05:25.590> if<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.890> can<00:05:26.010> show<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.220> there<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.030> it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
off if I can show you there so that it

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.750 
off if I can show you there so that it
wouldn't<00:05:27.270> actually<00:05:27.330> go<00:05:27.570> anywhere<00:05:27.600> anyway<00:05:28.760> now

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
wouldn't actually go anywhere anyway now

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.580 
wouldn't actually go anywhere anyway now
if<00:05:29.880> we<00:05:29.970> test<00:05:30.210> this<00:05:30.390> you<00:05:30.930> simply<00:05:31.230> step<00:05:31.410> on<00:05:31.530> the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
if we test this you simply step on the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.670 
if we test this you simply step on the
pressure<00:05:31.710> plate<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:34.050> can<00:05:34.170> jump<00:05:34.410> into<00:05:34.560> you

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
pressure plate and you can jump into you

pressure plate and you can jump into you
minecart<00:05:37.490> see<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.730> ends<00:05:38.940> working<00:05:39.330> as<00:05:40.020> it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
minecart see this ends working as it

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.900 
minecart see this ends working as it
should<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.650> then<00:05:41.160> if<00:05:41.250> we<00:05:41.340> do<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.580> same<00:05:41.730> to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
should and then if we do the same to

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.200 
should and then if we do the same to
this<00:05:42.000> end<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:43.490> minecart<00:05:44.490> comes<00:05:44.730> out<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.330> then

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
this end a minecart comes out and then

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.160 
this end a minecart comes out and then
on<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.360> other<00:05:48.390> side<00:05:48.720> as<00:05:48.870> well<00:05:51.110> where<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
on the other side as well where the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.690 
on the other side as well where the
minecart<00:05:52.560> will<00:05:52.650> safely<00:05:52.920> be<00:05:53.100> stored<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.550> the

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
minecart will safely be stored in the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.210 
minecart will safely be stored in the
drop<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.210> dispenser<00:05:54.890> so<00:05:55.890> that's<00:05:56.070> how<00:05:56.190> to

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
drop in the dispenser so that's how to

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.650 
drop in the dispenser so that's how to
build<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.640> super<00:05:56.910> flat<00:05:57.120> minecart<00:05:57.570> station

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
build the super flat minecart station

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.650 
build the super flat minecart station
guys<00:05:58.520> it's<00:05:59.520> clearly<00:05:59.850> very<00:06:00.000> easy<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.330> build<00:06:00.480> and

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
guys it's clearly very easy to build and

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.800 
guys it's clearly very easy to build and
requires<00:06:01.380> not<00:06:02.040> too<00:06:02.250> many<00:06:02.460> resources<00:06:02.720> but<00:06:03.720> it

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
requires not too many resources but it

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.450 
requires not too many resources but it
looks<00:06:04.080> really<00:06:04.230> good<00:06:04.440> keeping<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:05.010> world<00:06:05.190> nice

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
looks really good keeping the world nice

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.220 
looks really good keeping the world nice
and<00:06:05.670> flat<00:06:05.880> now<00:06:06.540> if<00:06:06.630> you<00:06:06.720> enjoyed<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.140> video

and flat now if you enjoyed the video

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.250 
and flat now if you enjoyed the video
which<00:06:07.830> will<00:06:07.980> think<00:06:08.190> of<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.280> like<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:09.110> is<00:06:10.110> all

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
which will think of it like that is all

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.660 
which will think of it like that is all
for<00:06:10.380> this<00:06:10.440> video<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.920> I'll<00:06:11.340> see<00:06:11.370> you<00:06:11.640> next
