00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:11.300
 It is a video of the continuation practice of the video of rounding off 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:18.680
 There are three numbers here, and these three numbers up to a thousand each 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.410
 In the same way, if it is rounded off to represent in, it will be expressed by an approximate number up to the hundreds 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.939
 When 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 Let's think in that order what happens if we express in round-off 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:36.510
 Well it may be a bit difficult, but if you look at it in order, you will gradually understand 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:39.400
 The first number 60,000 yen 7,810 67812 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.340
 It is 4 to measure this number 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:52.330
 What to do in Once you take please in terms of the approximate number of up to about thousand 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:56.770
 At the time of round-off , I am looking at one lower place than I said 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.420
 In a word, in the case of a thousand , it means that I will see the place of 100 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.489
 Then which one is closer 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.140
 Close to a large group or close to a real group, but cut it down or cut it up 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.960
 It's can be seen to say 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.260
 Thousand much went I leaf tea, which I'll look at the 100's place, which got off to now 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.970
 In here, round up to 4 and cut off 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:24.460
 I'm going to raise Chile off the coast from 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:29.740
 We round up because 8 is bigger than big cat 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:34.950
 Please be softening up at me and cage in until about here a thousand people increase in the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.470
 And then here is the henna hone 6 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.430
 It is 8 and it is 000 from the bottom 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:48.010
 60000 has occurred 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:52.900
 Let's go even if the place of 100 is okay If you say the place of 100 up to the place of 100 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:56.170
 You'll see much of anywhere about when are Once Sha five incoming told a few 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:03.940
 Oh so yeah it 's about 8 to 10 below 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:06.880
 Tens of give a look at the tens place 67812 was one 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.750
 This is because the dead purchase 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.530
 By 4 What is the actual sound by less than around key 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.780
 Aircraft is leased hand as it is this small part when the truncation 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.640
 002 is not listed 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.910
 This let represents to the nearest clay 67800100 at a distance Deyoka 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:38.250
 It is now zero, not zero, and it is 67,800. 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:43.830
 ok Let's practice a little more 76500 24 After using this number about a thousand 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:48.090
 The problem of saying it should be expressed by the approximate number 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.900
 If it is said that it is rounding up to about a thousand 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.019
 700 places like 100 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:00.540
 The number 100 is the issue number 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:04.120
 I live up here in a larger number of No. Toka degree from No. I'll think about rounding off the sword 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.400
 The Tteyuu when rounded up 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:13.350
 I can open you here by expressing it with numbers up to a thousand . 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 It will be 7 and it will be 6 to 1 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.850
 And after the Nanayama be closer to the raw 6524 is 000 almost 77,000 6000 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 77,000 yen more 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.710
 You do? If you said to please the number of approximate to the nearest Naruke I fish shades 100100 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.340
 Or 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.970
 I want to be in the tenth place 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.280
 I'm sorry I will look at the place of 7650024-10 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.450
 2 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 this is 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:54.890
 Truncated roof because Chissai than truncated rounded up land 4 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:58.200
 So part of the truncation is 76500'll be 002 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.570
 It is easy to understand the time of the fog students 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.900
 76500 24 is 76,000 when expressed by an approximate number up to about 106 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.960
 It became 500 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:19.400
 It is the last 9612 that you can come 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:23.030
 What should I do if I use this after making it about a thousand or so? 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.650
 If you keep saying to around thousand it Ne only place 3 of 100 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.520
 Or 100 of 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.210
 It's big issue this because they become Kokoroku 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:37.020
 Because it is a kill 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.440
 I will raise the class one before that- 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.930
 I asked him what happened 1 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:49.220
 It's a shame, so here's about one bigger and it's in 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 I wish I part after 0002 and 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.600
 At this time, a little 0 wo I chan up of thousands of positions without'm up to this much thousand poked 4 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.570
 It may already be 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.229
 In the cat of the house becomes one heavily on in like this time has expired this happens here is steep 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.950
 Because it became 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.190
 Ok ok then 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:13.740
 Likewise, this time to the extent of the customer 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:21.930
 If it is said that the number is 100 or so, it is only at the company's fifth place that I saw the 10 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:23.900
 Well when GoIri than a Chissai roof than like Once Ya' dead purchase of Tteyuu 16 City 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.230
 It is round off 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:36.560
 I cut it down from here and become 9600 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.310
 Maybe rounding may feel the hardest but most often used method 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.590
 is 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:47.080
 The first is rounded off to the various number of Well personal belongings It might also do a little confusing 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.080
 Be sure to be able to
