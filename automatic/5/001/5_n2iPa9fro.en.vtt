new turbo model and unlike the previous
turbo<00:00:14.829> this<00:00:15.429> one<00:00:15.699> is<00:00:16.119> actually<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.900> performance

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
turbo this one is actually a performance

turbo this one is actually a performance
enhanced<00:00:18.160> version<00:00:18.580> that<00:00:19.060> means<00:00:19.240> the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
enhanced version that means the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.850 
enhanced version that means the

that it has s I drive which is formerly
only<00:00:24.790> in<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> STI<00:00:25.300> that's<00:00:26.080> right<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:26.740> a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
only in the STI that's right this is a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.670 
only in the STI that's right this is a

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
manufacturers would throw an SUV onto a

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.139 
manufacturers would throw an SUV onto a
racetrack<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:41.379> that's<00:00:41.559> Subaru<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.760> is

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
racetrack but that's Subaru that is

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.969 
racetrack but that's Subaru that is
Subaru<00:00:43.569> they<00:00:43.749> these<00:00:44.079> guys<00:00:44.319> love<00:00:44.589> their<00:00:44.769> track

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
Subaru they these guys love their track

days

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
days

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.459 
days
yeah<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> need<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.870> wider<00:00:49.140> there

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
yeah I can see I need to go wider there

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
yeah I can see I need to go wider there
that's<00:00:49.679> like<00:00:49.949> throttle<00:00:50.760> Adil<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> down<00:00:51.449> shift

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that's like throttle Adil is down shift

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.710 
that's like throttle Adil is down shift
nope<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.230> run<00:00:52.469> by

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.230 

you<00:00:57.230> know<00:00:57.380> it's<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.800> CVT<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:58.820> not<00:00:59.030> gonna

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
you know it's a CVT so it's not gonna

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.600 
you know it's a CVT so it's not gonna
act<00:00:59.540> like<00:00:59.870> a<00:01:00.050> manual<00:01:00.470> even<00:01:00.920> when<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.430> its

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
act like a manual even when it's in its

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.380 
act like a manual even when it's in its
bow<00:01:02.330> 8-speed<00:01:03.110> manual<00:01:03.770> mode<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:04.910> is<00:01:05.120> cool

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
bow 8-speed manual mode which is cool

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.200 
bow 8-speed manual mode which is cool
but<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.440> know<00:01:06.560> on<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.100> track<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.850> kind<00:01:08.090> of

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
but you know on the track it kind of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.800 
but you know on the track it kind of
shows<00:01:08.750> its<00:01:09.050> deficiencies<00:01:10.150> now<00:01:11.150> what<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> couple

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
shows its deficiencies now what a couple

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.630 
shows its deficiencies now what a couple
things<00:01:11.960> about<00:01:12.140> sport<00:01:12.740> sharp<00:01:13.040> yes<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:13.430> car

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
things about sport sharp yes this car

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.630 
things about sport sharp yes this car
actually<00:01:13.880> has<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.510> SI<00:01:14.930> drive<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.280> also

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
actually has the SI drive that is also

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.300 
actually has the SI drive that is also
in<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.360> STI<00:01:17.750> what<00:01:18.440> that<00:01:18.620> does<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.010> when<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.160> go

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
in the STI what that does is when you go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.850 
in the STI what that does is when you go
in<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.430> support<00:01:19.760> sharp<00:01:20.150> mode<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.990> does<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> whole

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
in to support sharp mode it does a whole

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.530 
in to support sharp mode it does a whole
bunch<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.340> different<00:01:22.610> things<00:01:22.640> first<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.390> takes

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
bunch of different things first it takes

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.840 
bunch of different things first it takes
the<00:01:23.690> CVT<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.440> puts<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:24.800> into<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.040> special<00:01:25.370> 8

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the CVT that puts it into a special 8

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.719 
the CVT that puts it into a special 8
speed<00:01:26.180> manual<00:01:26.540> Matic<00:01:27.410> month<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.310> means

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
speed manual Matic month but that means

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.780 
speed manual Matic month but that means
it<00:01:28.880> emulates<00:01:29.240> an<00:01:29.690> 8-speed<00:01:30.470> Tiptronic<00:01:31.040> style

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
it emulates an 8-speed Tiptronic style

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.790 
it emulates an 8-speed Tiptronic style
shifter<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.780> paddle<00:01:33.229> shifters<00:01:33.560> right

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
shifter with the paddle shifters right

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.330 
shifter with the paddle shifters right
here

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.050 
here
it<00:01:34.700> also<00:01:34.940> will<00:01:35.660> engage<00:01:36.560> engine<00:01:37.340> braking<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.880> lot

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
it also will engage engine braking a lot

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.790 
it also will engage engine braking a lot
more<00:01:38.300> it'll<00:01:38.690> keep<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.080> revs<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.619> lot<00:01:40.130> higher

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.140 

it'll<00:01:45.800> also<00:01:45.979> hold<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.430> res<00:01:46.640> all<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> way<00:01:47.090> to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
it'll also hold the res all the way to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.109 
it'll also hold the res all the way to
red<00:01:47.420> line<00:01:47.660> so<00:01:53.050> it's<00:01:54.050> still<00:01:54.440> an<00:01:54.650> SUV<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:55.880> man

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
red line so it's still an SUV but man

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.840 
red line so it's still an SUV but man
this<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:56.479> fun<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.200> smooth<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:58.430> has<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
this is fun it is smooth this has the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.170 
this is fun it is smooth this has the
pillow<00:01:59.090> ball<00:01:59.360> suspension<00:02:00.170> from<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> STI<00:02:01.180> the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
pillow ball suspension from the STI the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.760 
pillow ball suspension from the STI the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
pillow pillow ball bushings in the front

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.560 
pillow pillow ball bushings in the front
and<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.520> what<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.790> does<00:02:04.940> is<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.180> parades<00:02:05.480> are

and in what it does is it parades are

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.880 
and in what it does is it parades are
very<00:02:05.750> smooth<00:02:06.260> but<00:02:06.800> controlled<00:02:08.890> handling

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
very smooth but controlled handling

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.090 
very smooth but controlled handling
which<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.670> nice<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.690> alright<00:02:12.590> kind<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.010> get
