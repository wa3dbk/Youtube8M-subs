applied to the back of the crystal the
wand<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> heat<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.969> glue<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.510> when

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
wand is going to heat the glue up when

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.099 
wand is going to heat the glue up when
it's<00:00:55.050> applied<00:00:55.289> onto<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.309> textile<00:00:57.000> surface<00:00:57.719> and

it's applied onto a textile surface and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's applied onto a textile surface and
then<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.309> adhere<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> we're<00:01:02.699> going

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
then it will adhere to it so we're going

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
then it will adhere to it so we're going
to<00:01:02.969> follow<00:01:03.180> through<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.660> operating

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
to follow through the operating

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.890 
to follow through the operating
instructions<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> reverse<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.180> tips

instructions on the reverse of the tips

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
instructions on the reverse of the tips
and<00:01:07.680> we're<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:10.880> screwing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and we're going to start off by screwing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
and we're going to start off by screwing
in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.150> appropriate<00:01:12.780> tip<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> size<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in the appropriate tip for the size of

minutes so we're good to go now this
little<00:01:39.570> rubber<00:01:39.900> map<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
little rubber map that we have here is a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270 
little rubber map that we have here is a
wonderful<00:01:42.119> thing<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.360> Dreamtime<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.619> going

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
wonderful thing that Dreamtime is going

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
wonderful thing that Dreamtime is going
to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> offering<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.149> offering<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to be offering is offering and it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
to be offering is offering and it's
great<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.220> sorting<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> crystals<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
great for sorting out the crystals and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
great for sorting out the crystals and
having<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.200> facing<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.939> way<00:01:51.240> up

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
having them all facing the right way up

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
having them all facing the right way up
which<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> what<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
which is what we need that so the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.180 
which is what we need that so the
colored<00:01:54.030> side<00:01:54.210> goes<00:01:54.540> into<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> applicator

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
colored side goes into the applicator

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.040 
colored side goes into the applicator
so<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.000> hot<00:01:58.210> enough<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.960> to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
so this is hot enough so I'm going to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.800 
so this is hot enough so I'm going to
place<00:01:59.290> this<00:01:59.530> over<00:01:59.800> one<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.850> crystals<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
place this over one of the crystals and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.740 
place this over one of the crystals and
it<00:02:01.900> will<00:02:02.050> pick<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.320> up<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:04.030> going<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.479> watch

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
it will pick it up I'm going to watch

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.320 
it will pick it up I'm going to watch
this<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.409> couple<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.830> minutes<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.790> see

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
this for a couple of minutes just to see

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.070 
this for a couple of minutes just to see
the<00:02:07.659> glue<00:02:08.319> start<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.979> bubble<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.840> for

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the glue start to bubble so it's for

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
the glue start to bubble so it's for
four<00:02:11.319> or<00:02:11.440> five<00:02:11.500> seconds<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.820> there<00:02:13.090> it's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
four or five seconds and there it's

want it to go and lift it off and that

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.030 
want it to go and lift it off and that
stone<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:23.830> there<00:02:24.250> once<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.000> glue<00:02:25.720> has

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
stone is on there once the glue has

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.949 
stone is on there once the glue has
cooled<00:02:27.040> down<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.700> stone<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.209> quite<00:02:28.450> hot<00:02:28.720> now

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
cooled down the stone is quite hot now

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.490 
cooled down the stone is quite hot now
so<00:02:29.290> once<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.650> glue<00:02:29.890> has<00:02:30.000> cooled<00:02:31.000> down<00:02:31.500> its

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so once the glue has cooled down its

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
so once the glue has cooled down its
well<00:02:32.980> applied<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.910> coming<00:02:34.269> off<00:02:34.450> and
