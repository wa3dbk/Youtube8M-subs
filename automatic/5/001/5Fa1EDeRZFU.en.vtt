00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.160
 in a time in which one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.990
 Singleplayer mode of a new shooter 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.580
 in a few hours the market has gone through 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.870
 of countless colorful titles for 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.610
 is flooded in between and the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 telekom online gaming in four hours 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 want to cut short per month 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 some core gamers experience weeks 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 or months spellbound in front of the screen 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 to squat and get away from a game for 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.289
 Hundreds of hours do not break loose 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.580
 we can in this special the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.260
 Games lead us with theirs 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 captivating gameplay their stories or 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.310
 their scope downright to the keyboard 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 or have the gamepad tied up in one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.279
 few minutes together we summarize what 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.270
 Lots of years of gaming experience 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.460
 can mean 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
 our ten biggest eaters of the day 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 gamings place ten 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 Skyrim only around the 20 hours playing time 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 you have to go for the main quest of skyrim 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 invest 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.200
 but that's actually more of a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.270
 Adding to the with side quests 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 Crowded world the developers 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 appreciate that you have about 300 hours all 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 various tasks can sink 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.770
 but then there is no crafting 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.180
 including what we alone 1 hour 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.949
 have spent flowers too 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.809
 pick or catch insects for new ones 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.059
 brewing potions is no kite 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.680
 skin and if you are a completely different 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 killer blood antesten and instead of one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 northern skin on it a high elf magician 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.060
 wants to start playing again 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.220
 at the front 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 for the most complete is the game anyway 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 There is nothing new in the world with time 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 albeit very simple additional quests 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 actually and always generates us 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.220
 Trab keeps new opponents bond and at all 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 corners and ends to explore invites 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.740
 place nine 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 heroes of might and magic with it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 turn-based strategy one tense 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.900
 to the screen must tie the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.579
 effect for long planning and risk 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.119
 to be rewarded perfectly 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 become 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 the heroes of might and magic series 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.700
 He did that brilliantly and left us 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 to work on epic battles in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 to whom the thorough preparation by 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 good management and targeted expansion 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 our heroes counted and with everyone 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.180
 Round at the one in earlier times 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.590
 ever had to wait a while came 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 add the tension what the opponent for 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.040
 Actions plans whether we at all right 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 make our empire secured 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.430
 Alone the time we with the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 listening to the wait tune spent 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.280
 have a modern swallows 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.439
 shooter place eight counterstrike in the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.820
 glorious time of lan parties as one 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.409
 as a gambler still with the computer in 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.940
 trunk to the cellar of friends 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.009
 set off to play together 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.819
 there was an undefeated king of the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.230
 shaken nights 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.150
 his career began as a controversy 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.069
 mod for half-life started soon 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.680
 a meteoric career as e-sport 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.120
 challenge of the early 2000s or 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 better than the starting point of e-sports 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.709
 altogether over 25 million copies 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.810
 were sold and tons of mods 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.040
 Basically everybody started creating 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 general suspicion of mostly rather 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.760
 unsuspecting lawyers and politicians 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.260
 that video games could promote violence 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.030
 but the only thing counter strike 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.859
 but really proven 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.209
 has caused enormous parts of the 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.209
 gambler leisure time to take advantage 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.049
 seventh place 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.879
 team fortress 2 you can work hard in 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.889
 a team shooter's classes and maps 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.269
 Realistically explain it or equate it 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.139
 let it be and have fun in the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.030
 foreground 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.010
 already made by the comic design 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.449
 world at team fortress 2 it's clear 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.219
 not here is not serious but 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.620
 Realism behind good game design 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.599
 is second to well-chosen classes 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.530
 with time more and more 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.299
 varied maps and creative 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.400
 Fashion was great with the players 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.590
 Faith now rewards five and a half 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.060
 years old title is still gambled 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.590
 and is now also free to play 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.049
 which invites even more sunk time 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.759
 place six pokémon you want player 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.590
 You can collect them for a long time 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.449
 few gimmicks have this concept 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.790
 so consistently simple and at the same time 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.439
 successfully implemented as pokémon the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.939
 whole premise the pocket monsters too 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.870
 seek to catch and train yourself 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.120
 so only the next challenge 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.859
 To be able to set goals for us 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.079
 to let invest time and patience 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.139
 why you do that in the first place 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.060
 line because of the pokémon 649 of the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.799
 digital beast between sugar sweet and 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.359
 cool, there is already the next wait 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.129
 only on release and already in 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.659
 the 90s were amazed showmaster over 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.370
 children all the monsters velvet 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.590
 by heart 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.120
 the game would be a closer illustration 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.919
 of the inspiration used 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.989
 Hobbies of the chief developer insects 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.810
 the success would probably not accumulate 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.120
 been so big 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.709
 place five diablo 2 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.819
 The word spiral was for diablo 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.109
 2 invented 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.269
 the milestone of action-roleplaying 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.590
 The formula had perfected us 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.389
 looking for always new and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.099
 better equipment on medium orgies 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.169
 sent by monster masses and then 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.039
 again only more difficult and again and 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.440
 once again 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.990
 only just a diablo purely short 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.580
 a few more are just farming again 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.190
 added up at diablo 2 to one 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.320
 enormous 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.060
 time spent testing a new one 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.100
 and level up for pvp exactly that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.810
 Proper weapons find that simple 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.130
 Gameplay actually was there anyway 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.130
 still something to do 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.550
 fourth place 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.380
 civilization who is as good as it gets 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.450
 Meyer is allowed to play his name quietly 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.980
 civilization is probably the stamp on it 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.140
 title the most with the designer 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.150
 the simulation is connected with us 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.380
 a single civilization in competition 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.510
 with others through different epochs 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.190
 Traditionally, this is tradition 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.720
 many possibilities to proceed 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.190
 various victory options and 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.750
 different strengths and weaknesses 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.580
 the peoples that you keep coming back 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.870
 can play differently and feel like it 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.930
 an observer but an alternative 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.940
 world history adds the mantra of the plane 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.500
 Another train is also available 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.530
 hardly any other series so resorted 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:18.260
 as in civilization, place three 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.540
 Minecraft the success story 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.920
 the last years or probably 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.020
 Of course, that is of course 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.770
 minecraft markus notch persson and 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.870
 modern 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.030
 why is a game that out of pixelated 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.919
 such a success exists because dice 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.570
 you can not stop because the 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.669
 possibilities are practically infinite 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.260
 whether we survive the skillful 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.270
 prove or in creative mode 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.010
 gigantic build as gigantic 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.720
 calculating machines or record-breaking 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.290
 Build tracks is pure 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.590
 theoretically never stop 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.530
 place two world of warcraft world of 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.580
 Warcraft is the mother of the modern MMO 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.500
 comparatively beginner-friendly with 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.600
 an ageless design and always and 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.410
 to find more and more together to kill 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.260
 and explore 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.120
 wow is designed as a time eater it should 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.100
 the players to stop hours around 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.180
 hours in succession in rage or in peace 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.130
 to stick to a faction 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.870
 we get title mounts and 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.910
 Chic items plugged when we look 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.200
 really strained are actually 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.400
 that almost mean in his 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.260
 friendly addiction effect though 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.640
 we can take over them then 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.550
 somehow not place one 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.770
 league of legends the genre of mobers 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.480
 multiplayer online battle arena games 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.520
 is still relatively young and developed 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.470
 itself osmos for starcraft and warcraft 3 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.270
 the principle with a strategy 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.160
 interface only a hero to control 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.630
 to level and equip this and 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.490
 to compete against another team 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.720
 and also with automatic 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.100
 generated droplets on the 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.870
 and on the opponent side and 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.820
 he looks forward to being beaten up 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.080
 However, such a fast one 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.580
 popularity that quickly the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.630
 different developers as well 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.460
 wanted to get in 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.080
 but at the moment a title has the 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.650
 competition quite clearly for itself 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.470
 decided 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.600
 league of legends 2009 published 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.340
 since then it offers us 113 well 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.320
 champions and a sophisticated system 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.720
 of skills magic runen and 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.160
 playing championships well is one 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.260
 question of domination of the respective 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000
 champions and teamwork and in one 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.070
 such a competitive title is the 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.030
 true perfection asked and the 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.820
 you do not just reach overnight 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.920
 but only by testing and learning practice 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.420
 Round around round in which like a river 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.670
 points for new champions and rest 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.710
 really gather who league of legends 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.970
 plays often and so fast 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.380
 session can be synonymous with a 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.340
 stressful everyday life somewhere 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.350
 to chat in between 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.270
 According to developer riot games are the 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.310
 12 million players daily 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.380
 that makes league of legends one of the 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.090
 most played games ever and 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.210
 probably the biggest time eater on ours 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.210
 list
