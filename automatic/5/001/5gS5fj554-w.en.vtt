table if I want all of the desk but the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.230 
table if I want all of the desk but the
problem<00:01:41.689> is<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.229> my<00:01:43.070> desk<00:01:43.369> had<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> glass

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
problem is is that my desk had a glass

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.050 
problem is is that my desk had a glass
surface<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.170> it's<00:01:45.289> very<00:01:45.499> hard<00:01:45.950> for<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.640> sensor

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
surface so it's very hard for the sensor

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.810 
surface so it's very hard for the sensor
on<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.240> bottom<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.630> mouse<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:48.289> know

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
on the bottom of the mouse so you know

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.660 
on the bottom of the mouse so you know
know<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.179> moving<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:52.100> lot<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.549> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
know that it's moving so a lot of the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.569 
know that it's moving so a lot of the
time<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:53.359> wouldn't<00:01:53.780> go<00:01:54.409> anywhere<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.549> I

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
time it just wouldn't go anywhere so I

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.559 
time it just wouldn't go anywhere so I
needed<00:01:55.999> no<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.359> different<00:01:57.229> surface<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.149> as<00:01:59.149> I

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
needed no a different surface and as I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.690 
needed no a different surface and as I
said<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.840> didn't<00:02:00.170> want<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.499> confined<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.670> I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700
