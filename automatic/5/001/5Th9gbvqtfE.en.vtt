00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.820
 how about friends again jaime wed 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.770
 i this time 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.999
 I want to talk to you 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.879
 of our publication 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.599
 Indian percent 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 for maintenance and repair the installation of the select group 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.919
 The purpose of this guide is to support the design and 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.319
 execution of scheduled maintenance 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.449
 directed to emergency generators 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 based on the rules of a shock and recommendations of the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.380
 manufacturers 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.230
 as you know the groups 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.310
 emergency generators 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.180
 they are used to give their energy supply in sporadic cuts of the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.050
 main supply network 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 which is why it is possible that in some cases 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.060
 its operation has been limited to a few hours 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.660
 those groups or those emergency power generation plants 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.220
 must always be enabled for those cases of emergency 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.830
 since it depends on it 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.739
 Preservation 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 of human lives 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.980
 the assurance of the set excellent operating conditions of a 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.900
 emergency equipment should be the goal of any program of 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.870
 supervision of preventive maintenance 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.460
 the design of a good maintenance program should get 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 the greater cooperative availability of an emergency generation group 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.409
 Another of the objectives of a good maintenance program is that of 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.630
 prolong the life of the components and reduce costs by 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 unexpected repairs 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.950
 the weekly maintenance routine for example 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.150
 or journals can be done by non-specialized personnel 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.750
 but wolves subsequent maintenance intervals should be brought finished by 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.640
 specialized personnel and under the recommendations of the manufacturers 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.890
 percent invited us here visit our site 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.560
 triple upct comes a point with 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 i see more information to attend to this course on the page 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.709
 power generation plants accused a total 7 Jan 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.260
 well that's it we'll see each other next pop ortu√±o
