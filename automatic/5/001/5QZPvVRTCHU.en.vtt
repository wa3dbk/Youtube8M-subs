three pounds light the shirt touches and
you<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.140> pop<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:08.940> exact<00:01:09.420> science

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
you get no pop so it's an exact science

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.930 
you get no pop so it's an exact science
and<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.500> knowing<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:11.100> body<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> coming

you can just be a technical thing you
know<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.239> know<00:03:26.420> guys<00:03:26.690> had<00:03:26.900> mentioned<00:03:27.290> 400

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
know I know guys had mentioned 400

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.330 
know I know guys had mentioned 400
pounds<00:03:28.430> raw<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.810> him<00:03:30.680> 850<00:03:31.549> with<00:03:31.700> here<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
pounds raw and him 850 with here so I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.090 
pounds raw and him 850 with here so I
guess<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.580> answered<00:03:34.940> itself<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.769> do<00:03:36.920> most

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
guess that answered itself so do most

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.490 
guess that answered itself so do most
most<00:03:37.489> people<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.850> come<00:03:38.090> into<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.480> sport<00:03:38.810> do

I said I love lifting wrong I love
lifting<00:03:54.769> here<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.030> I'm<00:03:56.480> not<00:03:56.630> really<00:03:56.870> on<00:03:57.140> a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
lifting here so I'm not really on a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.640 
lifting here so I'm not really on a
specific<00:03:57.950> side<00:03:58.250> because<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.269> understand<00:03:59.810> the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
specific side because I understand the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.490 
specific side because I understand the
way<00:04:00.769> both<00:04:01.040> people<00:04:01.459> feel<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.780> think<00:04:03.410> the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
way both people feel but I think the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.160 
way both people feel but I think the
true<00:04:03.769> athlete<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.400> one<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.880> can<00:04:05.060> go<00:04:05.810> wrong

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
true athlete is one that can go wrong

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.370 
true athlete is one that can go wrong
and<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:07.070> could<00:04:07.250> go<00:04:07.370> here<00:04:07.700> at<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.910> same<00:04:08.090> time

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
and it could go here at the same time

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.110 
and it could go here at the same time
and<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.680> said<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:10.010> started<00:04:10.430> off<00:04:10.609> in<00:04:10.910> raw

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and like you said you started off in raw

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.819 
and like you said you started off in raw
and<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.540> felt<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.930> reached<00:04:12.170> your<00:04:12.320> peak<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
and you felt you reached your peak and

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.140 
and you felt you reached your peak and
so<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:13.070> wanted<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.459> try<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:13.760> take<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.120> a

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
so you wanted to try and take it to a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.910 
so you wanted to try and take it to a
next<00:04:14.299> level<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:15.170> that's<00:04:15.380> why<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.620> went<00:04:15.829> to

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920
