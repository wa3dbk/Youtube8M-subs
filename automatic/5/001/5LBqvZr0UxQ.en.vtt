Jamie so next up I already have this
book<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.540> I've<00:04:32.660> read<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:32.930> book<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.230> few<00:04:33.350> times

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
book and I've read this book a few times

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.350 
book and I've read this book a few times
but<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.250> really<00:04:34.640> want<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.850> do<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:34.970> in<00:04:35.030> hardcover

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
but I really want to do it in hardcover

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.760 
but I really want to do it in hardcover
because<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.720> have<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.020> paperback<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.560> I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
because I have it in paperback and I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.020 
because I have it in paperback and I
think<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:36.980> hot<00:04:37.130> cup<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:37.670> really<00:04:37.850> pretty

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
think the hot cup is just really pretty

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.060 
think the hot cup is just really pretty
but<00:04:38.570> it's<00:04:38.690> unraveled<00:04:39.290> me<00:04:39.350> about<00:04:39.530> Tahereh<00:04:39.860> Mafi

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
but it's unraveled me about Tahereh Mafi

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.530 
but it's unraveled me about Tahereh Mafi
and<00:04:40.460> I'm<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:40.760> glad<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.240> picked<00:04:41.450> this

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
and I'm really glad that I picked this

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.480 
and I'm really glad that I picked this
up<00:04:41.690> in<00:04:41.840> hardcover<00:04:42.230> because<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:42.950> pretty

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
up in hardcover because it's so pretty

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.700 
up in hardcover because it's so pretty
next<00:04:44.240> up<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.540> I'm<00:04:44.630> kind<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.080> annoyed<00:04:45.440> at<00:04:45.560> this

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
next up and I'm kind of annoyed at this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.770 
next up and I'm kind of annoyed at this
because<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.400> ordered<00:04:46.670> it<00:04:46.940> again<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.450> get<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.690> in

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
because I ordered it again to get it in

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.300 
because I ordered it again to get it in
hardcover<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.530> would<00:04:48.620> match<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.010> rest<00:04:49.130> of

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
hardcover so it would match the rest of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.960 
hardcover so it would match the rest of
my<00:04:49.460> shadow<00:04:49.880> me<00:04:50.030> set<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:51.440> opened<00:04:51.920> it<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.220> I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
my shadow me set and I opened it and I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.940 
my shadow me set and I opened it and I
got<00:04:53.240> this

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
got this

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.770 
got this
so<00:04:54.950> technically<00:04:55.400> yes<00:04:55.670> it's<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:56.030> hardcover<00:04:56.420> but

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
so technically yes it's a hardcover but

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.210 
so technically yes it's a hardcover but
like<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:59.120> not<00:04:59.300> really<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.780> hardcover<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:01.040> is

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
like it's not really a hardcover this is

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.280 
like it's not really a hardcover this is
what<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.430> wanted<00:05:01.670> them<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.820> look<00:05:01.970> like<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.930> is

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
what I wanted them to look like this is

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.740 
what I wanted them to look like this is
what<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.680> looks<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:03.980> it<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.750> significantly

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
what it looks like it is significantly

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.810 
what it looks like it is significantly
smaller<00:05:05.870> than<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.890> other<00:05:07.010> one<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.610> doesn't

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
smaller than the other one it doesn't

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.880 
smaller than the other one it doesn't
have<00:05:07.940> expensive<00:05:08.420> dust<00:05:08.600> jacket<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:09.740> got

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
have expensive dust jacket and it's got

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.670 
have expensive dust jacket and it's got
this<00:05:10.040> weird<00:05:10.340> spine<00:05:11.150> like<00:05:12.110> I'm<00:05:12.260> not<00:05:12.380> sure<00:05:12.560> if

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.620 
you can see it yeah I don't understand
it<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.340> emailed<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.910> Book<00:05:17.060> Depository<00:05:17.090> on

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
I'm like hey um I think you sent me the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.880 
I'm like hey um I think you sent me the
wrong<00:05:20.030> book<00:05:20.390> your<00:05:21.020> picture<00:05:21.320> says<00:05:21.500> it's<00:05:21.710> uh

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
wrong book your picture says it's uh

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.620 
wrong book your picture says it's uh
it's<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.580> one<00:05:22.700> that's<00:05:22.790> gonna<00:05:22.970> match<00:05:23.180> my<00:05:23.210> set

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
it's the one that's gonna match my set

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.470 
it's the one that's gonna match my set
why<00:05:24.500> isn't<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.400> they're<00:05:25.700> like<00:05:25.850> oh<00:05:26.000> well<00:05:26.360> we

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
why isn't it and they're like oh well we

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.970 
why isn't it and they're like oh well we
outsource<00:05:26.930> them<00:05:27.110> from<00:05:27.290> places<00:05:27.500> so<00:05:27.830> we

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
outsource them from places so we

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.290 
outsource them from places so we
couldn't<00:05:28.190> predict<00:05:28.790> that<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:28.970> was<00:05:29.090> going<00:05:29.240> to

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
couldn't predict that that was going to

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.060 
couldn't predict that that was going to
happen<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.810> think<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.170> you're<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.650> gonna

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
happen and I think so you're not gonna

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.410 
happen and I think so you're not gonna
fix<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.460> I'm<00:05:31.580> not<00:05:31.670> going<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:31.940> get<00:05:32.090> my<00:05:32.210> hard

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
fix it I'm not going to get my hard

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.060 
fix it I'm not going to get my hard
cover<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:33.230> now<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.380> have<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.680> look<00:05:33.800> for<00:05:33.920> hard

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
cover so now I have to look for hard

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.680 
cover so now I have to look for hard
covers<00:05:34.310> elsewhere<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.360> first<00:05:35.510> book

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
covers elsewhere and so the first book

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.030 
covers elsewhere and so the first book
in<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.960> shadow<00:05:36.140> me<00:05:36.260> series<00:05:36.560> looks<00:05:36.890> something

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
in the shadow me series looks something

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.350 
in the shadow me series looks something
like<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.370> rest<00:05:37.520> of<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.670> shadow<00:05:37.880> maid<00:05:38.030> series

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
like the rest of the shadow maid series

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.940 
like the rest of the shadow maid series
and<00:05:38.720> I'm<00:05:38.810> not<00:05:38.930> sure<00:05:39.080> how<00:05:39.200> I<00:05:39.230> feel<00:05:39.320> about<00:05:39.620> it

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
and I'm not sure how I feel about it

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.650 
and I'm not sure how I feel about it
and<00:05:40.130> finally<00:05:40.550> one<00:05:40.700> of<00:05:40.730> my<00:05:40.910> new<00:05:41.090> favorite<00:05:41.480> books
