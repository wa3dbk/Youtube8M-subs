00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I think we all know that but I think if

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.330 
I think we all know that but I think if
Manny<00:00:42.420> Pacquiao<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.140> keep<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.530> pace<00:00:43.800> he's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
Manny Pacquiao can keep that pace he's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010 
Manny Pacquiao can keep that pace he's
had<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> past<00:00:44.969> he<00:00:45.300> bring<00:00:45.570> him<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> this

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
had in the past he bring him to this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.770 
had in the past he bring him to this
this<00:00:46.590> championship<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> he<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this championship that he has now this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
this championship that he has now this
position<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> he<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.430> he

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
position that he has now and he can he

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
position that he has now and he can he
can<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.750> claudi<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:54.180> it's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
can put that on claudi then I think it's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
can put that on claudi then I think it's
going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> shut<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> people<00:00:55.350> but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
going to shut up a lot of people but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.099 
going to shut up a lot of people but
then<00:00:55.739> again<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:57.059> may<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.079> a

mayweather camp just had that have a
problem<00:05:26.110> with<00:05:26.470> now<00:05:27.280> all<00:05:28.060> right<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.690> would<00:05:28.840> say

why<00:05:29.650> don't<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.919> just<00:05:30.130> go<00:05:30.370> ahead<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:31.110> take<00:05:32.110> the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
why don't you just go ahead and take the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.290 
why don't you just go ahead and take the
test<00:05:32.500> anyway<00:05:32.890> because<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:33.400> for<00:05:33.790> boxing

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300

test anyway because it's for boxing
right<00:05:34.630> yeah<00:05:35.380> i<00:05:35.410> guess<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.340> look<00:05:36.550> at<00:05:36.700> it

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
right yeah i guess you can look at it

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.280 
right yeah i guess you can look at it
that<00:05:37.000> way<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.540> can<00:05:37.720> look<00:05:37.840> at<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:38.050> on<00:05:38.229> the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
that way and you can look at it on the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.290 
that way and you can look at it on the
other<00:05:38.530> side<00:05:38.800> because<00:05:38.979> if<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.310> was<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.700> and<00:05:39.940> you

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
other side because if it was you and you

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.960
