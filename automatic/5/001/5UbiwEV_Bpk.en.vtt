power-chord

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:27.500 

and<00:00:13.019> then<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> G<00:00:14.160> power<00:00:14.460> chord<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.420> the

and then to a G power chord so in the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
and then to a G power chord so in the
verse<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.199> cores<00:00:28.470> which<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.279> C

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
verse we have two cores which are C

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:41.150 
verse we have two cores which are C
energy<00:00:37.070> OC<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.280> play<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:38.579> open

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.869 

how<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.760> planet<00:00:42.090> we've<00:00:42.300> got<00:00:42.450> C<00:00:42.690> energy

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.100 

so<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> course<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.930> b7<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:54.110> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so in the course we have a b7 here to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.490 
so in the course we have a b7 here to
see

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.910 

pair<00:00:58.310> that<00:00:58.430> twice<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.150> b7

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pair that twice so b7

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.200 
pair that twice so b7
to<00:01:02.730> say

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.440 

and<00:01:05.870> then<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:06.230> go<00:01:06.350> down<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.100> G<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:11.300> then

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
and then we go down to a G and then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.790 
and then we go down to a G and then
you've<00:01:11.570> got<00:01:11.720> your<00:01:11.810> distortion<00:01:12.350> back<00:01:12.500> on<00:01:12.680> it

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
you've got your distortion back on it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.800 
you've got your distortion back on it
and<00:01:12.890> you've<00:01:12.980> got<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.740> C<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.340> G<00:01:20.030> power

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
and you've got the C and the G power

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.420 
and you've got the C and the G power
chord<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.740> you're<00:01:21.860> back<00:01:21.979> into<00:01:22.190> another

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
chord then you're back into another

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.150 
chord then you're back into another
verse<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:24.229> let<00:01:24.350> me<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> second<00:01:24.979> verse

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
verse so let me have the second verse

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.350 
verse so let me have the second verse
which<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:25.880> C<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.970> G<00:01:29.210> again<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
which is C to G again then we have the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:45.539 
which is C to G again then we have the
caller<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:32.869> b7<00:01:34.990> g<00:01:35.990> RC<00:01:36.229> o<00:01:37.630> b7<00:01:40.540> C<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:43.250> that's<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:44.000> G

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
caller so b7 g RC o b7 C and that's a G

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.149 
caller so b7 g RC o b7 C and that's a G
and<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> says<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:47.710> you're<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.890> real
