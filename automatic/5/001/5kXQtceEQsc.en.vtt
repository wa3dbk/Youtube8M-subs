00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.810
 jo people your back muscles and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.009
 another new series here on my 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.359
 channel and as jamie 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.799
 this was probably one of the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.690
 most difficult series that I have on my channel 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 start because get a kem 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.630
 strike 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.099
 with a weapon of choice in offense and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.960
 if there has been difficult videos 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.580
 it is a kem strike and hurts because 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 the board goes all the 100 points 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 so minimum must be eskild 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 made jar immediately ended and yes 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.420
 if I do not pay attention immediately think then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 dick and hurts is also a very difficult one 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 gay mouth because everyone runs around fast 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 and you really have to focus very quickly on the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 msn just have to hit but we 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.899
 will of course try our best 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 I don't go to this series too often 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 I just always do an a2 plus 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 behind each other about how much 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.370
 gets thumbs up and then you see 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.379
 automatically from their de bourgh ending or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 I get the kem strike or not if you do it 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 Well like idea and if you want more 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 To see this series and like him 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 the moment I can thus account 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 and we just keep going to do our best 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 that's all we can do 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.360
 then we also have to do it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 you have to be very good to want a timer led 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.469
 if I don't come and go for a while 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 of course immediately runs the time off and on 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.199
 that's why I stay more than why 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.379
 very much because I did n't know where 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 If an old person is sitting, then one is running 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.240
 I don't think they will be a bite 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 my exciting all jairam 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.869
 so there are seven one goes positives 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 Immediately episode number only now 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.170
 should we continue we will 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 must pay attention to campsites and sharks 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 that is because you often come across that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.939
 hurts and therefore more immediately a dick 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.920
 of course because if you put that thing on you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.140
 head then you can forget about 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 your cam fight you keep focusing on us 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 curve there is a measure around that shit that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.229
 with you walked as slowly as you what those 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 teammate emilie person along someone he 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.350
 can happen should not be from teammates me 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.440
 had the way I stay alive 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.360
 key point, I mean that 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.360
 now we again ride to site and ton 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.420
 another script I think the when 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 coming from the other side we will be 11 0 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 But the problem now is the people 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 his lover just play against it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 two enemies 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.390
 no now my timer goes past anyway 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 because I can not get more kills 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 now i can't get kills shame 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.160
 timer disbelief no no no no no no 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.590
 no no no 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.550
 oh oh oo oh oh oh yes no no oh my god 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.630
 No 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.820
 no no no no no oh my jean s that is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.440
 is also problems hurts that is real 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.090
 Probably the biggest problem 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.630
 crank that if people love your timer 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.280
 expires 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.810
 if you team that play me this top and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.340
 street jesus' for example 20 the one 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.630
 rather miss to lie down 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 we expect the new people john 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.050
 I cannot claim that because in timer 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.370
 then just runs out so I'm waiting now 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.320
 however, that the new people are because 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.430
 I was also not playing this and this 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.080
 really is a big problem 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 someone is also eight zero in my team 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.250
 sas show did i and he had such a ben too 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.590
 be blown up pay attention 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.880
 you go sand and I get blown up too 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.350
 is there a fake on watch just like a kill 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.180
 After he was lucky that again people 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.920
 john no okay we will run around again i 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.709
 maybe I immediately hit strike 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.390
 able to pick up man really really a shame 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.920
 those people were also raised by 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.080
 1100 again were better at the yummy 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.250
 streak and then that happens well 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.360
 welcome to call of duty ghosts because it 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.920
 it just takes half an hour before we get new 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.690
 people who play games that is too 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.840
 actually a bit of a problem 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.550
 coffee from the coast as you sit on 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.000
 a 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.980
 bow tie shit holy shit then always lift 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.420
 in a real and those parties remedies 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.890
 just immediately the dick but there is 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.570
 a lot of action of course inc brings and 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.280
 I think that's happy with my journal Ma 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.780
 and it 's a very nice game ever 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.610
 you need it to watch your timer them 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.320
 was really the most important thing in this 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.150
 she timer expires b dead ready just 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.740

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 we are going really nice Wednesday from 18 a 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.850
 boy should you check if i like me not 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.930
 was also blown with those seconds then 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.940
 I might have had one right now 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.990
 could get those games but we go 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.860
 just try again right away 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.860
 episode number 2 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.180
 o what a mess you saw it there 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.620
 happened more than the three ones 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.970
 music cafe shed at an i thought up 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.230
 the forest already dead and she was not yet 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.160
 I started on this shoot, but I was 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.750
 not so I start back to the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 another and occasionally a dog 8 came to him 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.620

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.580
 well again have a dog man who is a guy 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.580
 bsb sociology 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 the lap there was in my throat 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.930
 sat again subscription pay attention 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.450
 Teammate you saw up now is not at least minimal 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.160
 as well watching you 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.590
 so chin hurts cranks really careful 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.090
 game because if someone like that timer is you 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.260
 want to save of course get 5 presses 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.300
 where you that is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.030
 marathon agility stalk breeding school 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.380
 ready and with that perth is of course possible 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.209
 done around very quickly and that's why 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.620
 also so much action a crank that everyone 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.820
 if i wish its very very fast around 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.220
 can believe and I like that too 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.109
 a small but still unfortunate 343 he 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.550
 was old in my team too subtle 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.840
 put up with that going the shortest 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.790
 very quickly when you lay in such 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.230
 team sits but is still being played nicely 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.520
 lay quickly pack of course played as 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.080
 you want two games in succession 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.550
 see fifteen hundred likes I go 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 now two games in a row 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.000
 1000 likes the boat that within three four 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.380
 gives a new episode for days 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.020
 not to like watching it episode 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.020
 euros 1 to 100 ever again with people
