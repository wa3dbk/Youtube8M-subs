00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.850
 when josh this video is simply 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.500
 to inform them that we have a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.729
 new version and as always we have 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.530
 new doubts and nothing the main thing is that 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.250
 They must do exactly as I 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.350
 I did going to adjustments going to generate

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.219
 I go back and I repeat that I also said it in

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.770
 leave the link of that video here I'm going to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.679

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.630
 from ios 6.1 point 3 if you want 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.759
 they can upload to ios 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.259
 bair a ios 7 beirÃ¡n 5 they do it like me 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.880
 I did it in that video if you guys 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.149
 they need me to do that again 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.710
 video again refreshing from ios 6.1 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.619
 point 3 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 ios 7 you tell me here below and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.159
 I look at my finger here I demonstrating my 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.890
 of my finger was not coming out in the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.500
 you say it down here and I 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.170
 I make the video but they have to upload 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.320
 blood 6.1 point 3 must go up 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.840
 directly to beira 5 using the method 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.659
 from beira 1 that I'm going to leave the video 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.729
 in the decision of this same video ok 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.710
 let's start a little for this video 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.570
 it's not to show you everything new I do not 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.550
 I'm doing that kind of videos myself 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.739
 I only make the video where they 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.500
 I inform that we already have to see 5 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.970
 available and telling them by answering 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950
 your city to download it 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.360
 then since we are going to upload 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.010
 let's see as well as a few first 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.580
 impressions to see if we can see something 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.920
 again so ok ok let's wait 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.750
 that this procedure ends for 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 continue with the good video yes or yes already 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.880
 as we can see , it's time to update 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.290
 and as always brings changes so small 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.610
 I do not mention it to everyone but the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.000
 changes so you can see from afar 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.950
 is look at adjustments now we have 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 icons you can see there now 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 also in the control center 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.700
 we can activate and deactivate the control 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.980
 center in applications from the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.740
 applications look here this is new and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.350
 look at the animation that nine 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.900
 I do not know if you can see very well but it 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.570
 see excellent here we can observe it in 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.880
 sing only what we could activate or 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.130
 disable on the unlock screen 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.440
 and here we can restrict access in 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.210
 excellent applications but I would like 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.890
 make it in certain applications like 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.960
 we had as services that I could 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.090
 activate in certain applications so 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.220
 we are advancing little by little 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.040
 they know how to get by with this jet type 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.660
 beiras then we also have to like 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.850
 can see in the calls too 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.709
 we have new icons this is something that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 I had to change the farm to be able to 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.780
 show and also in notifications 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.120
 when you do not get a nastic and there you see me 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.340
 a notification arrived and we have more 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.190
 good information this is what 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.459
 in the same banner we can do it like this 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.830
 below and see more information about 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.269
 that tweet that's something also of the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.090
 new things that is not going to get 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.650
 many tweets we also have to if 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.069
 let's share something the icon of 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.870
 twitter is also different the slide 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.319
 when we are going to pay also what 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.610
 they changed and that looks different thing 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.099
 these are the changes that I have seen 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.080
 well and also that when we are 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.060
 turning on that was something that I read in 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.730
 of you see that it is black combined with 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.310
 the iphone and the white icon you see 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.700
 that you do not see the division then in 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.650
 a white iphone was bad because the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.919
 iphone white and then black then 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.440
 now this part the manzanita will be black 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.530
 and the white outside so that already 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 combine with the iphone those are the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.030
 new changes the different things that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.800
 I have found here below if you 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.100
 find something new can you tell me 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.810
 of course this version fixes 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.570
 many mistakes we had in the version 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.910
 before beira 4 and that's what we 're going 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.660
 to see here many solution 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.360
 to problems something new like that and maybe 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.730
 for version 6 we also have more 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.460
 solutions this version expires in 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.620
 October 1 ok that means that it 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.540
 he wins that does not mean he's going to come out 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.610
 a new one for October one means 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.620
 that by October 1 you can not 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.240
 be using this version ok that's why it's 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.430
 that several members have told me that 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.200
 Martian I got stuck the device is 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.570
 because you did not update to the 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.060
 most recent version each version that 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.740
 comes comes with an expiration date 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.090
 this version expires in October not 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.610
 means that it's going to be in October 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.640
 come the other version but already for 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.310
 that time you must have climbed 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.360
 to version 6 or version 7 also 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.330
 Many people are wondering what 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.890
 how many versions are we going to have 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.290
 supposedly I'm not very sure but 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.230
 I heard that until version 8 before 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.550
 have the version that I know I said jm in 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.680

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.430
 I have since my first video and sorry for 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.620
 that's why 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.000

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.500
