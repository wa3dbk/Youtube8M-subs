onions you want the green part and the
white<00:02:01.320> part<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.490> snap<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> half<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
white part just snap that in half so it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
white part just snap that in half so it
doesn't<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.770> too<00:02:04.950> tangled<00:02:05.540> squish<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.659> down

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
doesn't get too tangled squish it down

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.460 
doesn't get too tangled squish it down
tight<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:09.770> about<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> spoon

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
tight and then you take about a spoon

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.790 
tight and then you take about a spoon
small<00:02:13.160> spoonful<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.820> suppose<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.800> fried

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
small spoonful I suppose of the fried

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.310 
small spoonful I suppose of the fried
onions<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.360> about<00:02:17.540> half<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.080> suppose

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
onions so it's about half it I suppose

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.570 
onions so it's about half it I suppose
and<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.920> throw<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.610> there<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.880> well<00:02:21.580> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
and you throw that in there as well and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:33.360 
and you throw that in there as well and
then<00:02:30.520> okay<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.550> that's<00:02:31.850> fine<00:02:32.210> that's<00:02:32.450> like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
then okay so that's fine that's like

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.040 
then okay so that's fine that's like
it's<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.550> completely<00:02:35.000> mince<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.570> about<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
it's not completely mince but about that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.640 
it's not completely mince but about that
much<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.380> fine<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.490> need<00:02:37.760> em<00:02:38.030> two

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
much is fine now you need em two

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.350 
much is fine now you need em two
tablespoons<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.920> ground<00:02:40.280> flour<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
tablespoons of ground flour this is a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.950 
tablespoons of ground flour this is a
the<00:02:41.900> same<00:02:42.110> as<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.380> chickpea<00:02:42.740> flour<00:02:43.010> basically

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
the same as a chickpea flour basically

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.820 
the same as a chickpea flour basically
and<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.520> get<00:02:46.670> two<00:02:46.910> tablespoons<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.630> this

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
and so we get two tablespoons of this

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.100 
and so we get two tablespoons of this
and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> add<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.220> 100<00:02:50.060> ml<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.270> cold<00:02:50.630> water

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
and you add it to 100 ml of cold water

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.680 
and you add it to 100 ml of cold water
just<00:02:51.230> from<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> tap<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.000> mix<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.390> up<00:02:56.540> it

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
just from the tap you just mix it up it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.800 
just from the tap you just mix it up it
doesn't<00:02:57.290> matter<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.860> doesn't<00:02:58.010> completely

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
doesn't matter if it doesn't completely

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.480 
doesn't matter if it doesn't completely
whisk<00:02:59.810> up<00:03:00.110> or<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:00.620> there's<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.890> few<00:03:01.070> lumps<00:03:01.250> you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
whisk up or if there's a few lumps you

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.030 
whisk up or if there's a few lumps you
just<00:03:01.700> want<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.170> try<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.680> blended

quite low in salt so and you don't have
to<00:03:29.300> worry<00:03:29.480> about<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.930> whole<00:03:30.080> dish<00:03:30.230> being<00:03:30.440> too

salty<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.660> tablespoon<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.290> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
salty so it's just a tablespoon of that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.410 
salty so it's just a tablespoon of that
I'm<00:03:33.860> now<00:03:34.370> going<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.730> add<00:03:34.910> some<00:03:35.180> fish<00:03:35.390> sauce

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
brands don't particularly matter either

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.650

so<00:03:43.700> long<00:03:43.850> as<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.150> not<00:03:44.239> too<00:03:44.570> salty<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:46.660> then

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
so long as it's not too salty and then

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.350 
so long as it's not too salty and then
you<00:03:47.780> give<00:03:47.900> up<00:03:48.020> another<00:03:48.470> quick<00:03:48.709> mix<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.459> now

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
you give up another quick mix and now

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.050 
you give up another quick mix and now
you<00:03:50.420> add<00:03:51.850> five<00:03:52.850> hundred<00:03:53.300> mils<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.840> cold<00:03:54.260> water

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.010 

and<00:04:00.430> that's<00:04:01.430> still<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.790> nice<00:04:02.209> medium<00:04:02.600> low

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
and that's still on a nice medium low

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.600 
and that's still on a nice medium low
heat<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.100> let<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.340> simmer

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
heat and then you just let that simmer

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.479 
heat and then you just let that simmer
away<00:04:04.900> these<00:04:05.900> are<00:04:06.110> just<00:04:06.260> normal<00:04:06.680> rice<00:04:06.980> noodles

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
away these are just normal rice noodles

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.010 
away these are just normal rice noodles
it<00:04:08.090> doesn't<00:04:08.360> matter<00:04:08.480> whether<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:08.900> the
