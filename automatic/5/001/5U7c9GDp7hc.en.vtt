he<00:01:48.640> drilled<00:01:48.909> several<00:01:49.149> holes<00:01:49.330> along<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.170> lines

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
he drilled several holes along the lines

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.190 
he drilled several holes along the lines
right<00:01:50.680> here<00:01:51.040> all<00:01:51.759> around<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.420> he

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
right here all around it he

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.469 
right here all around it he
spray-painted<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.490> dark<00:01:54.880> color<00:01:55.149> I

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
spray-painted it all a dark color I

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.930 
spray-painted it all a dark color I
think<00:01:55.810> I'll<00:01:56.140> be<00:01:56.259> with<00:01:56.409> his<00:01:56.560> blue<00:01:56.830> but<00:01:57.759> any

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
think I'll be with his blue but any

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.389 
think I'll be with his blue but any
color<00:01:58.240> would<00:01:58.450> work<00:01:58.690> something<00:01:59.619> so<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.100> snakes

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
color would work something so the snakes

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.510 
color would work something so the snakes
feel<00:02:00.700> secure<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.420> lose<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:02.049> then<00:02:03.039> he<00:02:03.220> cut<00:02:03.490> a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
feel secure you lose it then he cut a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.240 
feel secure you lose it then he cut a
hole<00:02:03.789> right<00:02:04.090> here<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.830> allows<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
hole right here and that allows the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.309 
hole right here and that allows the
snake<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.360> curl<00:02:07.600> up<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.050> that's<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
snake to go in and curl up and that's a

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.660 
snake to go in and curl up and that's a
tight<00:02:08.560> box<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.209> do<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.800> thing<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.489> in
