00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.809
 backwards from so that it is quite vulnerable according to still giving up literally 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.460
 comics externalities of course the municipality of heemstede yes 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 3 a bald head but lots of places 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.450
 He also made it if you have a question 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.660

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 we have had 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.150

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 go it fn i was talking about one 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.200
 how far it goes in the disease process but it became and while it actually 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 decided to do that late stage that any case of the expelled the most 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.610
 bad for the fight 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 to go completely bald we have therefore on 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.940
 boxing proficiency so much asked and that of November 2 each time to the increased interest 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.480

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.889
 also it might be mendes after all, swimming out of what he is in 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.390
 Mars always had the depression there by appearance in axes 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.629
 but it's just really for that reason around your eyes 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.949
 several layers on top of each other 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.719
 and that's it I'm still completely plastered with just one 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.180
 escharen space a part of the preparation and helps that well during 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.039
 playing 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.409

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.049
 I close my eyes and stick everything together 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.239

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.189
 feet and door shut said something changed she's not even gonna take the time 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.639

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.629
 our story 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
 they cycled everything is out of the world 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.179
 according to the municipality 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.249
 and know what you are looking for woman 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.649
 I have nothing about the hedgehog girls also it is a respect and the director 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:09.079

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.730
 with her screenplay the previous films written his second cd and that's it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 also so that the baton completely behave or do you think the ecb also 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.430
 one time to go, I am sure it will also go on 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.420
 the bin go it is the effect on the set all the time could look 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.140
 The fingers end up agreeing myself too I'm sure I was through 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.730
 with sometimes very good as sure that these were not nice 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.459
 9 hereby at that time that not 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.609
 9 not really either 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.229
 and what a very difficult turn that day of protest was at stake 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.409
 this 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.949
 much nicer and quite spicy 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.650
 and with every threat that is own results in soest turnover very much 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.589
 strength riser today that was the challenge to put everything on it 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.749
 sometimes a little snow on the sector 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:03.899
 talk that reports the klpd let that also know two to make further spin 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:09.269

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.089
 A little bit must really be very flexible and have a lot of patience 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.460
 I have 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.579
