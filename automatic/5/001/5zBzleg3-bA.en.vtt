00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello you online store 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.810
 president watches and today we will tell 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:16.440
 to you about one of the most popular models 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:19.230
 the gk110 gb1 collection here in front of us 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.420
 model is made in black and gold 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
 color 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 it is made of high quality 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.289
 polyurethane making it very durable 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.349
 and frost and durable strap he 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 also from polyurethane 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.410
 metal fastener rear covers 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.460
 also metal tempered 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.079
 mineral glass scratch protection 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 shockproof model this is achieved 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.489
 by the fact that he has a special body 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 forms 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.559
 that is, the front end bulges out and not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.039
 gives glass a flat hit 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.090
 its surface dimensions are 55 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.370
 millimeters wide 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.070
 17 millimeters in thickness 72 grams weight 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 way to display the time model 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.530
 analog + digital that is and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 arrows and their electronic time can be 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.689
 set up differently i.e. digital 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 time let's say will display 5 hours 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.689
 analog 6 hours is convenient yet for 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.810
 those who often move between two 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.909
 time zones mechanism she has 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.729
 quartz they work on batteries 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 stroke accuracy plus minus 20 seconds a month 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.470
 for thought that the mechanism of quartz it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.009
 Again, shockproof very reliable 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.190
 the mechanism here is the impermeability of this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.300
 models 200 meters 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.930
 with it you can dive to great depths 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.170
 under water is one one but there is under water 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.420
 you can not press the buttons but the model 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.380
 automatic backlight is provided 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.830
 which makes a very comfortable diving with this 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.350
 by model 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.750
 stealth on you don't have to click on 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.350
 button because the backlight will work 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:14.680
 with the inclination of the wrist further model more 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.320
 besides highlighting there are many functions 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.709
 the first one is a stopwatch he has two 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.860
 standard mode from circle mode to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.209
 what is the difference in standard mode when 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.000
 you make an intermediate time mark 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 does not stop going that is the very first 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.890
 the moment she goes when we cutoff 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 we remove that we see the time that has passed 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.790
 from the very beginning in time lap mode 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.440
 starts to go from 0 so we do 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 cutoff so every circle and 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.130
 time went from scratch if my doing again 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.390
 Here you see that it is difficult 0 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.290
 the next mode is the reverse timer 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.190
 countdown 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.570
 he also comes in two modes 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.840
 standard with repetition about deliveries 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.290
 timer reaches zero clock publishes 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.420
 beep that's with you mode 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.840
 repeating the timer will start going again and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.910
 again when it comes to zero again be 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.910
 beep and again 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.590
 restart 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.600
 next world time mode that is you 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.400
 you can choose the clock without changing 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.150
 different time zone and apply it 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.819
 temporarily 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.510
 and also then turn on your again 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.890
 Timezone 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.640
 very convenient function further 5 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.220
 alarm clocks 4 standard and 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.569
 one alarm clock with a repeat that is here 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.299
 they are 4 standard 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.709
 it is an alarm clock with a repetition it will 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.519
 repeat every five minutes after 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.920
 how to earn and start indication often 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.670
 there is the beginning of every hour the model will be 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.680
 beep it is probably all 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.359
