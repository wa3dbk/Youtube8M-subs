00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.870 
catch I haven't even really played catch
with<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> Pro<00:00:25.109> 1000<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.880> 12-inch

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
with it the Pro 1000 is a 12-inch

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040 
with it the Pro 1000 is a 12-inch
pattern<00:00:27.590> um<00:00:28.590> I've<00:00:29.070> been<00:00:29.359> couch<00:00:30.359> catch<00:00:30.689> stuff

pattern um I've been couch catch stuff

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.260 
pattern um I've been couch catch stuff
like<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.369> starting<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.030> broken

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
like that so it's starting to get broken

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.420 
like that so it's starting to get broken
in<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.899> definitely<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.590> near<00:00:35.040> game

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
in but it's definitely not near game

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.690 
in but it's definitely not near game
ready<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:37.050> says<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.260> tan<00:00:37.950> horror<00:00:38.520> winged

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
ready this says all tan horror winged

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
ready this says all tan horror winged
leather<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.239> believe<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.829> step<00:00:41.250> down

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
leather I believe this is one step down

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
leather I believe this is one step down
or<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.210> down<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.690> code<00:00:42.930> 55<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.430> step

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
or not down from code 55 but one step

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
or not down from code 55 but one step
more<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.320> oil<00:00:46.620> infused<00:00:47.010> than

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
more has more it's more oil infused than

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
more has more it's more oil infused than
code<00:00:47.730> 55<00:00:48.239> leather<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.680> code

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
code 55 leather I think this is code

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150 
code 55 leather I think this is code
five<00:00:50.280> five<00:00:50.550> five<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> heart<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> hide

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
five five five and the heart of the hide

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.080 
five five five and the heart of the hide
dual<00:00:54.030> cores<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.960> use<00:00:55.110> code<00:00:56.090> five

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
dual cores they actually use code five

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
dual cores they actually use code five
five<00:00:57.449> five<00:00:57.750> five<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.609> oil

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
five five five which is like really oil

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.270 
five five five which is like really oil
and<00:01:00.090> fees<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.420> call<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> feather-light

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
and fees they call it feather-light

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.380 
and fees they call it feather-light
which<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.910> soft<00:01:03.329> leather<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> I'm

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
which is that really soft leather so I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
which is that really soft leather so I'm
just<00:01:06.510> gonna<00:01:06.600> start<00:01:06.869> off<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> pattern

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
just gonna start off with the pattern

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.429 
just gonna start off with the pattern
you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.850> per<00:01:09.030> 1000<00:01:09.600> uh<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.140> problem

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you can see it's per 1000 uh the problem

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.820 
you can see it's per 1000 uh the problem
is<00:01:10.830> basically<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.330> 12-inch<00:01:13.020> pattern<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is basically just a 12-inch pattern of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.030 
is basically just a 12-inch pattern of
the<00:01:14.159> perb<00:01:14.520> 200<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.590> common

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the perb 200 which is a very common

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
the perb 200 which is a very common
eleven<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> half<00:01:17.850> inch<00:01:18.090> pattern<00:01:18.450> for

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
eleven and a half inch pattern for

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.370 
eleven and a half inch pattern for
shortstop

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
shortstop

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.820 
shortstop
so<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.130> glove<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> made<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.119> third<00:01:21.299> base

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
so this glove is made for third base

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.219 
so this glove is made for third base
it's<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> play<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.750> cool

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.600 

it's<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.380> nice<00:01:28.650> glove<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> deert<00:01:29.400> and

it's very nice glove the deert and
cowhide<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.829> lot<00:01:31.829> better<00:01:32.670> than<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.000> expected

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
cowhide is a lot better than I expected

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.109 
cowhide is a lot better than I expected
it<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.020> honest<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.970> didn't<00:01:36.000> I've

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it to be to be honest I didn't I've

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
it to be to be honest I didn't I've
never<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.630> used<00:01:36.900> endeared<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> cowhide

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
never really used endeared and cowhide

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
never really used endeared and cowhide
before<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.110> formed<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
before it's actually formed to your

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.660 
before it's actually formed to your
fingers<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.189> well

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
fingers really well

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
fingers really well
one<00:01:42.479> thing<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.930> change<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.890> have

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
one thing I would change is not have

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.139 
one thing I would change is not have
this<00:01:44.570> yellow<00:01:45.570> color<00:01:46.380> I'd<00:01:46.890> rather<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
this yellow color I'd rather have the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
this yellow color I'd rather have the
shell<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> inside<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.670> I'd<00:01:50.729> be

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
shell other to be the inside so I'd be

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
shell other to be the inside so I'd be
whoring<00:01:51.299> inside<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.350> make<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
whoring inside now which would make it a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
whoring inside now which would make it a
lot<00:01:52.799> stiffer<00:01:53.070> too<00:01:56.689> so<00:01:57.689> yeah<00:01:59.270> it's<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.360> H<00:02:00.540> web<00:02:00.719> as

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
lot stiffer too so yeah it's an H web as

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.410 
lot stiffer too so yeah it's an H web as
you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.079> tell

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.370 

simple<00:02:05.320> no<00:02:05.530> finger<00:02:06.490> pad<00:02:06.730> no<00:02:07.210> palm<00:02:07.750> pad<00:02:07.990> as<00:02:08.259> it
