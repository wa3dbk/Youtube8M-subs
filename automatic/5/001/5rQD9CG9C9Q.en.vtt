00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.180
 two 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.300
 and I'll be showing you one that is 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.010
 pretty great for people who 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.080
 They like to decorate their house 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.040
 we will be watching it is pretty 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.750
 great is a mold of chimneys how they see 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.420
 are all these types of chimney this 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.670
 from diamond to carved stone 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.250
 that they can do it they transferred from 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 this way replacing all the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.670
 blocks used as for example if 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.030
 you want to be one of stone brick 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 Well with stone brick with 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.340
 bricks here would be brick 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.739
 climbing all of brick sandstone 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.840
 from the net it's pretty cool that you can 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.870
 do all these types of combinations 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.479
 of gold iron to that would be 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.850
 lapis lazuli oxidizes with oriana 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.619
 the diamond is the only one that gives you 16 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.140
 what everyone else is going to give you 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.420
 here as you see also quartz is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.759
 pretty cool this you can do and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 good these bricks the good this 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.210
 chimney are going to be putting 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 in its different types of homes like 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.170
 for example I would have an example here 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.530
 it worked out pretty well because my house 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.939
 of wood and as I do not know very well decorate 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.920
 Well, I do not get it right here 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.750
 example here would you put this there are two 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.820
 ways to put the bricks as they are 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.159
 seeing here our myth will come out 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.509
 you can download me alone that I went up to 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.090
 that you can see that they can 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.880
 put different types of blocks for 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.520
 that this one so that it looks not here here 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.289
 we will cover this and there it does not leave because 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.780
 he does not have anywhere to go out here he would be 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.420
 this here we go and it goes down you 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.670
 can do between longer more more 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.009
 cool for you depends on how much height 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.210
 want to have their place fireplace 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.490
 we remove this and here we cover this and here 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.890
 we would treat this that would be how 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.560
 make your fireplace not here could you 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.840
 you put in different places is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 the first would be a first choice 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.269
 the oven and then the fireplace or 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.650
 would have for example put it next 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.080
 as you see here is the oven and here it is 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.720
 the working fireplace can put it 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.190
 of you which thing you want 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.900
 put here you can also put it here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.730
 side as you want only to be 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.870
 connected to this and the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 fueguito can put only one 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.560
 It depends on your decoration you want 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.799
 do as for example a decoration 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.870
 I can think of would be as 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.840
 this new professional champion does not come out 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.790
 something like that and they would make me 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.470
 realize that this is your wall to import 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 that your chimney goes out there like that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.599
 it would look like it would look pretty good it looks 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.579
 how is the myth coming out and so 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.230
 would be a type of decoration like this or like 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.540
 you see they are not very decorated by 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.790
 I do not give you any more examples and it is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.319
 mold story is pretty 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.910
 simple but you are going to 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.980
 put anywhere as per 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.650
 example, they want to feel very cool, 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.810
 They make very cool waka for then tell me 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.540
 who copied me from our diapers here 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.190
 we put this and we could this here as 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.129
 they see does not work because it must be up 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 or back here we put this and this and here 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.629
 they would be and they would already look like 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.459
 that they have left the diamond and here 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.099
 they would be with their super chimney or what 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.720
 they can put the equipment so they can put 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.120
 this here puts our team in this 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.579
 here and it would be another type of decoration a 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.930
 type so not like that it would already be on only 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.069
 I do not know why it does not turn on 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.519
 fireplace and it's 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.530
 being there my god here is and so 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.200
 I would be learning and then you already 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.090
 will have their type of decoration so what 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 good of these threats that can be 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.079
 camouflage for the blocks that you 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.019
 have for example if you want a 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.450
 fireplace of my home you 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.909
 You can come here and put it here and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.329
 it looks like a normal block, you can not 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.950
 change does not look bad and good 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.359
 this would be the kind of chimneys that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.950
 has this market agra this fireplace 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.579
 It's pretty cool I hope you like it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.439
 this mod 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.939
 because I was made something useful for 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.980
 the decorations of his medium that 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.560
 you should always be doing like a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.630
 type with lens stone and with a 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.039
 lighter and so get this fine but 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.019
 so they would have one more type of decoration 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.639
 simple and good would be the remember mode 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.710
 that installs with force I do not know how to handle 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.910
 I like favorites and subscribe to 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.889
 channel if they are not with him 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.139
 they have my facebook on my twitter from the 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.580
 description and stratum of friends so 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.360
 see you in the next matt so 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.419
