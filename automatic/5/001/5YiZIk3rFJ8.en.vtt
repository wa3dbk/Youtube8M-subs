vlog thing I know I've been talking

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.109 
vlog thing I know I've been talking
about<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.369> while<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.759> haven't<00:01:50.970> put

about that for a while and I haven't put
out<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.390> I'm<00:01:52.110> still<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> trying<00:01:52.829> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
out any I'm still kind of trying to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
think about how to go about doing it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
think about how to go about doing it
without<00:01:54.990> starting<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.430> know

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
without starting it and then you know

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
without starting it and then you know
not<00:01:57.240> knowing<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> next<00:01:58.590> vlog

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
not knowing what to do on the next vlog

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.850 
not knowing what to do on the next vlog
so<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.860> use

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
so what I think I'm going to do is use

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
so what I think I'm going to do is use
vlogs<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.149> answer<00:02:03.509> questions<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
