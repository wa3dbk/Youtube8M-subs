that<00:00:27.480> I've<00:00:27.570> been<00:00:27.810> doing<00:00:28.199> I've<00:00:29.160> actually<00:00:29.369> been

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that I've been doing I've actually been

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330 
that I've been doing I've actually been
making<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> chart<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> different

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
making a chart of the different

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
making a chart of the different
skylanders<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.480> putting<00:00:33.719> them

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
skylanders and actually putting them

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.639 
skylanders and actually putting them
into<00:00:34.489> their<00:00:35.489> own<00:00:35.640> categories<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.350> my

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
into their own categories so and it's my

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.290 
into their own categories so and it's my
sort<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> predictions<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.879> many<00:00:38.940> there

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sort of predictions as to how many there

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
sort of predictions as to how many there
are<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.510> obviously<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.410> there's<00:00:40.590> 16

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
are so obviously you can see there's 16

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
are so obviously you can see there's 16
boxes<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> obviously<00:00:42.390> we've<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.870> had

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
boxes here and obviously we've only had

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
boxes here and obviously we've only had
four<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.160> track<00:00:44.399> masters<00:00:44.850> revealed<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> us

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
four of the track masters revealed to us

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770 
four of the track masters revealed to us
so<00:00:46.140> they're<00:00:46.289> already<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> some

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so they're already in here but some

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.209 
so they're already in here but some

got four and you can see all the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
got four and you can see all the
elements<00:00:56.760> above<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> their<00:00:57.870> colors<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
elements above them and their colors of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
elements above them and their colors of
the<00:00:58.469> elements<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.789> at<00:00:59.910> they're<00:01:00.059> trapped

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the elements you look at they're trapped

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
the elements you look at they're trapped
aenean<00:01:00.780> weapons<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
aenean weapons and you can see that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.560 
aenean weapons and you can see that
there<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.030> colored<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
there they actually colored to what the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.350 
there they actually colored to what the
to<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.750> their<00:01:07.369> element<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:09.030> for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to what their element is so you know for

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.230 
to what their element is so you know for

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fire red and dead is grey fine I get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
fire red and dead is grey fine I get
that<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.340> for<00:01:20.340> Earth<00:01:20.520> you've<00:01:20.880> got<00:01:21.240> walloped

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that and for Earth you've got walloped

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
that and for Earth you've got walloped
there<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> brown<00:01:22.229> weapons<00:01:22.799> almost<00:01:23.250> orange

there with brown weapons almost orange

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
there with brown weapons almost orange
but<00:01:23.850> they're<00:01:24.000> probably<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.659> brown<00:01:25.049> than

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
but they're probably more brown than

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.660 
but they're probably more brown than
they<00:01:25.979> obviously<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.670> they're<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.720> hand

shield sword sort of thing so there's
plenty<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.860> stuff<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
plenty of stuff we can think of and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.310 
plenty of stuff we can think of and
especially<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.170> these

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
especially to go with all these

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
especially to go with all these
different<00:01:55.820> elements<00:01:56.820> we've<00:01:57.299> got<00:01:57.509> left<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
different elements we've got left to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590 
different elements we've got left to
fill<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:59.040> I've<00:01:59.159> also<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.700> or<00:01:59.969> started<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
fill in but I've also got or started to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 
fill in but I've also got or started to
compile<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.520> same<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.030> new<00:02:03.210> cause<00:02:03.540> again

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
compile the same for new cause again

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
compile the same for new cause again
looks<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.009> i'm<00:02:05.189> thinking<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.700> 16<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.719> can

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
looks like i'm thinking of 16 you can

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
looks like i'm thinking of 16 you can
see<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> 16<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> moment<00:02:08.459> looking

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
see it 16 because at the moment looking

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
see it 16 because at the moment looking
at<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.780> we've<00:02:09.959> seen<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.520> trailer<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
at what we've seen from the trailer and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.630 
at what we've seen from the trailer and
all<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.390> i'm<00:02:12.569> guessing<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.230> two

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
all that i'm guessing the two

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.790 
all that i'm guessing the two
the<00:02:13.730> bottom<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.360> knew<00:02:14.660> whether<00:02:15.350> they<00:02:15.590> are<00:02:15.620> or

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the bottom and knew whether they are or

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.070 
the bottom and knew whether they are or
not<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.280> another<00:02:16.490> thing<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.090> could<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.450> so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
not is another thing but it could be so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.390 
not is another thing but it could be so
I've<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.290> put<00:02:18.650> pictures<00:02:19.040> they're<00:02:19.220> all

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
I've just put pictures they're all

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.030 
I've just put pictures they're all
around<00:02:19.670> putting<00:02:20.000> them<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.240> right<00:02:20.390> columns

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
around putting them in the right columns

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
around putting them in the right columns
but<00:02:22.040> we'll<00:02:22.190> see<00:02:22.400> we'll<00:02:22.610> see<00:02:22.640> what<00:02:22.940> happens

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
but we'll see we'll see what happens

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.320 
but we'll see we'll see what happens
with<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.920> also<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.640> new<00:02:25.790> characters

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
with them and also the new characters

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.550 
with them and also the new characters
obviously<00:02:26.630> there's<00:02:26.780> only<00:02:26.900> two<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.140> them<00:02:27.410> at

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
obviously there's only two of them at

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.350 
obviously there's only two of them at
the<00:02:27.620> moment<00:02:27.980> shroom<00:02:28.250> boom<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.700> gill<00:02:29.180> grunt

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the moment shroom boom and gill grunt

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.210 
the moment shroom boom and gill grunt
but<00:02:29.930> they're<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.200> their<00:02:30.320> own<00:02:30.410> section<00:02:30.680> again

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
but they're in their own section again

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.140 
but they're in their own section again
me<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:31.910> thinking<00:02:32.120> 16<00:02:32.870> again<00:02:33.700> I've<00:02:34.700> also<00:02:34.910> got

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
me I'm thinking 16 again I've also got

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.590
