00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.369
 teaching how to prepare delicious 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
 spaghetti with lemon shrimp 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.900
 let's see the ingredients 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.179
 what we are going to need is half a pound 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.360
 of shrimp already have to be washed and 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.269
 unveiled a quarter cup of juice 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.199
 lemon that is more or less 2 the juice of 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.809
 two lemons a spoonful of parsley two 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.110
 tablespoons of butter a tooth of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 finely chopped garlic a quarter cup 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.229
 of white wine one teaspoon of oil 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.970
 olive and half a pound of spaghetti 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.440
 as a first step we are going to take the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 spaghetti in the boiling water 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.290
 let's give a little salt 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.270
 and olive oil so they do not stick 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.010
 and then when every spaghetti is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.190
 different have to be based on the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.260
 spaghetti package instructions 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.870
 while the spaghetti is cooking 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.790
 let's cook the shrimp and let's 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.790
 add the teaspoon of oil 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.900
 and butter until melted 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.299
 to butter let's add 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.299
 our eyes 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 we will add the parsley 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 good 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.660
 we will add the lemon juice 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.959
 and finally we will add the fine white 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.849
 let's let it cook this for 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.329
 minutes until reduce 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.329
 liquids 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.330
 since the liquids have reduced a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 little let's add the shrimp and 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.510
 remember that the shrimp are cooked 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.150
 they have a quickie so already when 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.440
 They begin to grasp the rosy color 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.440
 that are already cooked 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.650
 we will add a little pepper 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.920
 I like it with enough pepper 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 and a little bit of salt too 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.740
 Y 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.740
 we mix 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.560
 and so the shrimp will win the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.310
 flavor of garlic lemon until the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.310
 well delicious 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.810
 ah 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.040
 Y 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.569
 you also have to cook them here for a few 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.459
 minutes because remember that if over 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.389
 we cook the shrimp they do well 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.069
 taffy and they are not delicious so 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.959
 You have to be a little quick because 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.130
 already the spaghetti and even cook it and the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.320
 shrimp too so I'm 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.840
 at least as you have realized it is 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.180
 a very easy recipe to make reality 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.550
 I think it stays very delicious like that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.320
 that I hope you try and do and do not 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.120
