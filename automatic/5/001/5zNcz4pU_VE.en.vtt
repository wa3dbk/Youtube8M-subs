00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:24.200
 Welcome to the Mercedes-Benz Museum. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:35.410
 My name is Rodolfo Stampa. 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.854
 I want to kidnap you today in the world of sports cars 

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:43.854
 Take a look for yourself. 

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:08.586
 Here you can see the Mercedes 190 SL with 105 hp. 

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:15.090
 It reaches a top speed of 171 km / h. 

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:22.403
 The vehicle was produced from 1955 - 1961. 

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:53.700
 The roof of the vehicle can be completely removed, so you can drive open. 

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:57.850
 If it rains, but you have bad luck. 

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:05.910
 This original car belonged to an American pilot who was stationed in Germany at the time. 

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:10.440
 He bought this vehicle and picked it up in Sindelfingen 

00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:14.630
 and drove it all over Europe before it took me to America. 

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:20.960
 Later this pilot was an astronaut of the Apollo 15.
