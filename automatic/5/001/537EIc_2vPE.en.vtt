association and today we're talking
about<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> conserve<00:00:11.190> water<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.639> your

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
about how to conserve water in your

about how to conserve water in your
garden<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.719> now<00:00:12.990> we'll<00:00:13.679> discuss<00:00:14.120> reducing

lawn maintenance to conserve water use

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.750 
lawn maintenance to conserve water use
first<00:00:17.970> don't<00:00:18.630> overwater<00:00:19.230> water<00:00:20.189> only<00:00:20.580> when

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
first don't overwater water only when

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300 
first don't overwater water only when
your<00:00:20.850> lawn<00:00:21.060> needs<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.630> general<00:00:22.560> lawns<00:00:22.980> only

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
your lawn needs it in general lawns only

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
your lawn needs it in general lawns only
need<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:24.029> inch<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.359> water<00:00:24.539> per<00:00:24.810> week<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
need about one inch of water per week so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
need about one inch of water per week so
over<00:00:26.130> watering<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.820> necessary<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.990> can

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
over watering is not necessary you can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
over watering is not necessary you can
easily<00:00:28.470> check<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.580> lawn<00:00:29.789> needs

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
easily check to see if your lawn needs

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
easily check to see if your lawn needs
water<00:00:30.449> by<00:00:30.929> stepping<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> grass

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
water by stepping on it if the grass

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
water by stepping on it if the grass
blades<00:00:33.000> quickly<00:00:33.540> spring<00:00:33.840> back<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
blades quickly spring back then you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.160 
blades quickly spring back then you
don't<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> water<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:36.450> remain<00:00:36.780> flat

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
don't need the water if they remain flat

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.280 
don't need the water if they remain flat
then<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.579> water<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:38.940> lawn<00:00:39.290> then

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
then it is time to water your lawn then

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.440 
then it is time to water your lawn then
you<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> identify<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:41.309> soil<00:00:41.520> type<00:00:41.790> soil

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you want to identify your soil type soil

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.479 
you want to identify your soil type soil
types<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.020> differences<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.100> rate<00:00:44.280> at

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
types have differences in the rate at

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
types have differences in the rate at
which<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:45.000> absorb<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which they absorb water if you have a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
which they absorb water if you have a
heavy<00:00:46.920> soil<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.850> may<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> water<00:00:48.660> your

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
heavy soil you may need to water your

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
heavy soil you may need to water your
garden<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.410> several<00:00:49.890> smaller<00:00:50.460> doses

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
garden with several smaller doses

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
garden with several smaller doses
smaller<00:00:51.989> doses<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.680> allow<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> water<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
smaller doses will allow the water to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
smaller doses will allow the water to
soak<00:00:53.699> slowly<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> heavy<00:00:55.020> soil<00:00:55.350> instead<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
soak slowly into a heavy soil instead of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
soak slowly into a heavy soil instead of
losing<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:57.329> water<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.930> run<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.340> sandier

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
losing your water to run off sandier

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
losing your water to run off sandier
soils<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.820> take<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> longer<00:01:00.270> dose<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> soak<00:01:01.289> up

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
soils can take a longer dose and soak up

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
soils can take a longer dose and soak up
quickly<00:01:01.940> however<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> soil<00:01:03.359> dries<00:01:03.600> out

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
quickly however the soil dries out

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
quickly however the soil dries out
faster<00:01:04.500> therefore<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.489> better<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.210> take

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
faster therefore it's better to take

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
faster therefore it's better to take
shorter<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.560> frequent<00:01:08.100> waterings<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
shorter more frequent waterings to a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
shorter more frequent waterings to a
sandy<00:01:09.060> soil<00:01:09.590> water<00:01:10.590> early<00:01:11.040> believe<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:11.729> not

and six a.m. our best for your lawn why

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
and six a.m. our best for your lawn why
is<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.270> Sun<00:01:21.450> rises<00:01:21.689> it'll<00:01:22.439> start<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is that as the Sun rises it'll start to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
is that as the Sun rises it'll start to
evaporate<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> water<00:01:23.939> particles

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
evaporate a lot of the water particles

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
evaporate a lot of the water particles
from<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:24.780> lawn<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.470> watering<00:01:25.920> early<00:01:26.310> allows

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
from your lawn so watering early allows

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
from your lawn so watering early allows
that<00:01:27.150> water<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> infiltrate<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
root systems of you long don't water

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.569 
when it's too windy small particles of
