year round every year so if you don't
have<00:02:19.520> one<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.730> those<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:20.090> should<00:02:20.120> get<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:21.069> add

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
have one of those you should get one add

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.650 
have one of those you should get one add
a<00:02:22.099> little<00:02:22.220> bit<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.670> mix<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.060> flies<00:02:23.300> but

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
a little bit of a mix of flies but

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.059 
a little bit of a mix of flies but
probably<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.170> two<00:02:24.349> flies<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:24.980> been

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
probably the two flies that have been

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.440 
probably the two flies that have been
standing<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.670> best<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.090> us<00:02:26.180> has<00:02:26.420> been

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
standing out the best for us has been

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.270 
standing out the best for us has been
the<00:02:26.810> oceania<00:02:27.410> UV<00:02:27.890> by<00:02:28.069> rapture<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:30.280> genie

by<00:02:31.790> rapture<00:02:32.300> those<00:02:32.930> are<00:02:33.110> probably<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.500> two

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
by rapture those are probably the two

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.790 
by rapture those are probably the two
flies<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.340> been<00:02:34.430> work

flies that have been work

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.790 
flies that have been work
as<00:02:34.920> far<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:36.000> said<00:02:36.270> anywhere<00:02:36.630> between<00:02:36.840> 160

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
as far as I said anywhere between 160

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.860 
as far as I said anywhere between 160
and<00:02:37.830> probably<00:02:38.190> 240<00:02:38.850> feet<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.090> water<00:02:39.300> seems<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
and probably 240 feet of water seems to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.100 
and probably 240 feet of water seems to
be<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.080> best<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.390> pools<00:02:42.390> array<00:02:42.810> was
