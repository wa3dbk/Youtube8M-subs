the stitching on these cases is pretty

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
the stitching on these cases is pretty
tight<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.230> don't<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.529> any<00:00:28.740> loose<00:00:29.099> stitches

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
again the traditional hand band that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
again the traditional hand band that
we've<00:00:35.520> learned<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.320> grooves<00:00:37.590> for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
we've learned to like the grooves for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
we've learned to like the grooves for
the<00:00:38.010> different<00:00:38.309> viewing<00:00:38.489> positions<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the different viewing positions and then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
the different viewing positions and then
this<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.219> restraining<00:00:41.219> band<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> I'll

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
this little restraining band that I'll

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
this little restraining band that I'll
show<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.210> works<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
show you how this works you have all the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
show you how this works you have all the
cutouts<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:45.079> access<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
cutouts for access and then you have a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.360 
cutouts for access and then you have a
stylist<00:00:47.190> loop<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.600> how

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
stylist loop here so let's see how

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
stylist loop here so let's see how
inserting<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> ipad<00:00:51.239> looks<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> case<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
inserting the ipad looks in the case and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
inserting the ipad looks in the case and
how<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> auto<00:00:53.309> wake<00:00:53.550> feature<00:00:53.760> works<00:00:54.120> alright

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
how the auto wake feature works alright

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650 
how the auto wake feature works alright
so<00:00:55.140> we'll<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.920> ahead<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> insert<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.420> case

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so we'll go ahead and insert the case

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.349 
so we'll go ahead and insert the case
this<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> backing<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.789> case<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this way the backing of this case is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
this way the backing of this case is
like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> microfiber<00:01:01.289> finish<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.520> said

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
like a microfiber finish and as I said

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
like a microfiber finish and as I said
it's<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.329> well<00:01:03.600> stitched<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.439> we'll<00:01:04.589> go

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's very well stitched so we'll go

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's very well stitched so we'll go
ahead<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.860> slide<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.970> gets

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
ahead and slide it this way so it gets

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.440 
ahead and slide it this way so it gets
into<00:01:06.630> position<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.640> what<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.150> here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
into position and what you will do here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
into position and what you will do here
is<00:01:09.540> snap<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.920> doesn't<00:01:11.130> work<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is snap it in really doesn't work are a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.390 
is snap it in really doesn't work are a
lot<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> effort<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> close<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> case

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
again you have some good access to your

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.270 
again you have some good access to your
toggle<00:01:51.630> switch<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.259> either<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.710> mute<00:01:53.070> or

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
toggle switch for either your mute or

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
toggle switch for either your mute or
your<00:01:53.549> rotation<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.600> volume<00:01:54.960> control

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
your rotation and your volume control

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.700 
your rotation and your volume control
and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> well-placed<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.600> would<00:01:57.719> say<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and you have a well-placed I would say a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.920 
and you have a well-placed I would say a
little<00:01:59.159> loop<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.850> stylus<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> say<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.750> well

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
little loop for stylus I say it's well

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
little loop for stylus I say it's well
place<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.340> other<00:02:02.460> cases

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
place because we see in other cases

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
place because we see in other cases
where<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> loop<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.810> side<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
where the loop is on this side and the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
where the loop is on this side and the
problem<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.100> having<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> loop<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> top

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
problem with having the loop on the top

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.719 
problem with having the loop on the top
is<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> rub<00:02:07.170> against<00:02:07.560> your

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
is that it's going to rub against your

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
is that it's going to rub against your
volume<00:02:08.729> rocker<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.989> having<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
volume rocker so I like having it on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.100 
volume rocker so I like having it on the
bottom<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> way

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
bottom so that it's not in the way

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.470 
bottom so that it's not in the way
of<00:02:13.320> these<00:02:13.500> controls<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.850> don't<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
of these controls and you don't get it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.720 
of these controls and you don't get it
all<00:02:15.630> dang<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:17.010> would<00:02:17.160> open<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> case

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
all dang up if we would open the case

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460 
all dang up if we would open the case
and<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.420> were<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.660> leverage<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.110> Autoweek

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and we were to leverage the Autoweek

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.090 
and we were to leverage the Autoweek
feature<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.550> tablet<00:02:21.510> does<00:02:21.660> turn<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.830> once

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
feature the tablet does turn on so once

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.630 
feature the tablet does turn on so once
again<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:24.320> okay<00:02:25.320> close<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.770> away<00:02:25.830> so

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
again it's off okay close it all away so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
again it's off okay close it all away so
not<00:02:26.820> shut<00:02:27.030> down<00:02:27.180> open<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.230> I'll<00:02:28.470> turn

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
not shut down open it up and I'll turn

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.640 
not shut down open it up and I'll turn
on<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.730> closes<00:02:30.450> without<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:31.080> effort<00:02:31.320> which

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
on it closes without much effort which

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.820 
on it closes without much effort which
is<00:02:31.800> good<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.700> does<00:02:32.880> stay<00:02:33.180> close<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
is good and it does stay close to the to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.380 
is good and it does stay close to the to
the<00:02:34.860> actual<00:02:35.280> tablet<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.820> also<00:02:36.000> gives<00:02:36.300> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the actual tablet it's also gives you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.650 
the actual tablet it's also gives you
good<00:02:36.540> protection<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> multi-angle<00:02:39.000> case

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
good protection it is a multi-angle case

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.990 
good protection it is a multi-angle case
so<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.860> were<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> put<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.430> first<00:02:41.820> position

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
so if I were to put it in first position

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.120 
so if I were to put it in first position
this<00:02:42.360> would<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.630> one<00:02:42.780> viewing<00:02:42.990> angle<00:02:43.410> put<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
this would be one viewing angle put in a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
this would be one viewing angle put in a
second<00:02:44.490> position<00:02:44.600> third<00:02:45.600> position<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.380> then

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
second position third position and then

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.949 
second position third position and then
this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> final<00:02:47.190> position<00:02:47.630> if<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.810> want

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
this is the final position if you want

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.320 
this is the final position if you want
to<00:02:49.020> watch<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.230> movie<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:50.550> grooves<00:02:50.850> are<00:02:51.090> pretty

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
to watch a movie the grooves are pretty

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.510 
to watch a movie the grooves are pretty
deep<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.020> as<00:02:52.260> you're<00:02:52.530> moving<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:53.040> around<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
deep so as you're moving it around I

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.280 
deep so as you're moving it around I
always<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.090> kind<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.330> test<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.110> not

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
always do this kind of test it does not

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.900 
always do this kind of test it does not
pop<00:02:55.560> out<00:02:55.739> I've<00:02:55.950> had<00:02:56.100> other<00:02:56.250> cases<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.820> as

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
pop out I've had other cases that as

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.330 
pop out I've had other cases that as
you're<00:02:57.150> moving<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.570> around<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.650> comes<00:02:58.890> off<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
you're moving it around it comes off and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.250 
you're moving it around it comes off and
this<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.580> important<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.020> plane

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
this is important if you're on a plane

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.290 
this is important if you're on a plane
and<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.920> turbulence<00:03:02.280> or<00:03:02.700> even<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
and you have turbulence or even if you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140 
and you have turbulence or even if you
are<00:03:03.989> on<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.500> train<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.220> bus<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.970> don't

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
are on the train or the bus you don't

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920 
are on the train or the bus you don't
want<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.690> case<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.140> bumpy<00:03:07.830> ground<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:09.690> has

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
want in the case of bumpy ground it has

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900 
want in the case of bumpy ground it has
another<00:03:10.170> feature<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.880> are

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
another feature so that if you are

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.050 
another feature so that if you are
holding<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.510> tablet<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.560> elastic<00:03:14.459> band

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
holding the tablet this elastic band

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.600 
holding the tablet this elastic band
goes<00:03:15.660> around<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.130> allows<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
goes around like this and it allows you

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.509 
goes around like this and it allows you
to<00:03:17.880> hold<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:19.110> tablet<00:03:19.350> in<00:03:19.680> position<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.280> that

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
to hold the tablet in position so that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.600 
to hold the tablet in position so that
you<00:03:20.880> don't<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.480> flapping<00:03:22.140> around<00:03:22.610> you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
you don't have this flapping around you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.860 
you don't have this flapping around you
have<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.799> hand<00:03:25.799> kind<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.459> elastic<00:03:27.120> rip<00:03:27.390> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
have this hand kind of elastic rip that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.199 
have this hand kind of elastic rip that
allows<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> hold<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.100> case<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.850> then

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
allows you to hold the case and then

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.300 
allows you to hold the case and then
also<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.720> does<00:03:30.900> not<00:03:31.049> open<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
also it does not open so that's the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.550 
also it does not open so that's the
purpose<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.760> little<00:03:33.030> elastic<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:34.080> again

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
purpose of that little elastic so again
