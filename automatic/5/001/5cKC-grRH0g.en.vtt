a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.030> stroke<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.989> said<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> max

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
a lot of stroke you said it at the max

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.310 
a lot of stroke you said it at the max
if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.239> lever<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> travel<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> very

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
if you want your lever to travel a very

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
if you want your lever to travel a very
short<00:00:49.680> distance<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.250> min<00:00:50.460> stroke<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> said<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
short distance a min stroke you said it

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.290 
short distance a min stroke you said it
at<00:00:51.360> min<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:53.039> accompanying<00:00:53.520> feature<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
at min the accompanying feature is the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
at min the accompanying feature is the
reach<00:00:54.510> adjust<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.500> allows<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> rider

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
reach adjust which also allows the rider

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
reach adjust which also allows the rider
to<00:00:56.250> set<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> lever<00:00:57.360> home<00:00:57.629> position<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.500> how

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to set the lever home position or how

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.889 
to set the lever home position or how
far<00:00:58.890> away<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> lever<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> grip

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.660 

additionally<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.140> increase<00:01:04.680> power<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
additionally we increase power in this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
additionally we increase power in this
brake<00:01:05.939> system<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.540> wanted<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> be

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
brake system we wanted it to be

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
brake system we wanted it to be
extremely<00:01:07.560> powerful<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.250> made<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> new

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
extremely powerful so we made a new

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
extremely powerful so we made a new
caliper<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> larger<00:01:10.350> piston<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.890> which

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
caliper with a larger piston in it which

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.550 
caliper with a larger piston in it which
increases<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> hydraulic<00:01:12.240> ratio<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
increases the hydraulic ratio what that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
increases the hydraulic ratio what that
means<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.909> given<00:01:15.270> force<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.780> squeeze

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
means is for a given force you squeeze

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
means is for a given force you squeeze
the<00:01:16.200> lever<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.130> more<00:01:17.400> clamp<00:01:17.850> force

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the lever with you get more clamp force

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.590 
the lever with you get more clamp force
down<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.229> rotor<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.150> new<00:01:21.360> pad

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
down here at the rotor we have new pad

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
down here at the rotor we have new pad
system<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.560> loading<00:01:22.830> pad<00:01:23.130> system<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
system it's a top loading pad system it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
system it's a top loading pad system it
doesn't<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.330> traditional<00:01:25.049> Hayes<00:01:25.590> spring

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
doesn't use the traditional Hayes spring

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.710 
doesn't use the traditional Hayes spring
clip<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.820> load<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> back<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
clip they load in from the back and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
other bits on the brake finally we've

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.260 
other bits on the brake finally we've
got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.259> new<00:01:37.470> two-piece<00:01:37.890> rotor<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
got a new two-piece rotor with this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
got a new two-piece rotor with this
two-piece<00:01:39.630> rotor<00:01:39.930> allows<00:01:40.259> us<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> cut

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
two-piece rotor allows us to do is cut

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
two-piece rotor allows us to do is cut
weight<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:41.990> we're<00:01:42.990> able<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> anodize<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
weight out we're able to anodize it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
weight out we're able to anodize it
again<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.340> match<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> brake<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.210> cosmetic

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
again to match the brake for cosmetic

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.319 
again to match the brake for cosmetic
reasons<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> primary<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.210> get

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
reasons but the primary thing is we get

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
reasons but the primary thing is we get
to<00:01:48.479> design<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.140> structure<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:50.220> this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
to design more structure into this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789 
to design more structure into this
carrier<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> rotor<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.470> stiffer

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
carrier so that the rotor is stiffer
torsionally<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.820> previous<00:01:54.270> stainless

torsionally than previous stainless
stainless<00:01:55.170> steel<00:01:55.560> rotors<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.119> stiffer

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
stainless steel rotors so it's a stiffer

stainless steel rotors so it's a stiffer
