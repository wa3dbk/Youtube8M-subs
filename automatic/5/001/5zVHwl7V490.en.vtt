press the button I want to make five

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.330 
press the button I want to make five
blocks<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.309> flat<00:00:35.640> blocks

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
blocks and it really flat blocks

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
blocks and it really flat blocks
the<00:00:38.340> only<00:00:38.520> drawback<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.070> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the only drawback to it is that you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.350 
the only drawback to it is that you
can't<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> maximum<00:00:42.840> speed<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
can't put it the maximum speed so you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
can't put it the maximum speed so you
don't<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.649> big

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
don't really want to use it to go big

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.959 
don't really want to use it to go big
long<00:00:47.250> distance<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:49.469> take<00:00:49.710> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> long

here and then your opposite on the other
side<00:02:29.709> looks<00:02:30.709> kind<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.099> like<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:32.980> windmill<00:02:33.980> type

side looks kind of like a windmill type
of<00:02:34.549> deal<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.250> then<00:02:37.720> let's<00:02:38.720> do<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> whole<00:02:39.470> year

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.199 
buttons if you hold the corner
release<00:02:56.750> your<00:02:56.870> button<00:02:57.549> do<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.609> same<00:02:58.849> thing<00:02:59.120> on

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
release your button do the same thing on

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.390 
release your button do the same thing on
the<00:02:59.329> other<00:02:59.359> side<00:03:02.739> another<00:03:03.739> thing<00:03:03.980> about<00:03:04.190> these

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
the other side another thing about these

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.490 
the other side another thing about these
is<00:03:05.889> if<00:03:06.889> you<00:03:07.359> see<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.389> believe<00:03:08.510> Ryan's<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.230> little

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
is if you see I believe Ryan's a little

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.890 
is if you see I believe Ryan's a little
plus<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.609> starts<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.209> all<00:03:11.419> the<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:11.660> out<00:03:11.720> on

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
plus that starts it's all the way out on

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.039 
plus that starts it's all the way out on
the<00:03:11.930> -<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:13.910> need<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.180> count<00:03:14.450> from<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.660> plus

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
the - so you need to count from the plus

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.960 
the - so you need to count from the plus
side<00:03:15.319> first<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.930> are<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.290> would<00:03:18.799> say<00:03:19.760> making

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
side first so are you I would say making

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.759 
side first so are you I would say making
an<00:03:20.120> elevator<00:03:20.510> put<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.780> plus<00:03:21.079> at<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> bottom

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
an elevator put the plus at the bottom

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.680 
an elevator put the plus at the bottom
floor<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.690> then<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.139> -<00:03:25.299> nice<00:03:26.299> where<00:03:26.540> up

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
floor and then just the - nice where up

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.089 
floor and then just the - nice where up
and<00:03:27.410> then<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.069> on<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.549> forth

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
and then so on and so forth

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.949 
and then so on and so forth
so<00:03:31.099> I<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.430> get<00:03:32.269> this<00:03:32.480> one<00:03:32.870> two<00:03:34.030> three<00:03:35.030> four

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
so I can get this one two three four

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.059 
so I can get this one two three four
five<00:03:36.950> later<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:38.329> turns<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.720> off

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:53.170 

one<00:03:45.069> two<00:03:47.170> three<00:03:49.359> four<00:03:51.459> slides<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.849> not<00:03:53.000> just

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
one two three four slides it's not just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:03.729 
one two three four slides it's not just
be<00:03:53.359> down<00:03:53.569> that<00:04:01.810> take<00:04:02.810> you

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
be down that take you

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.069 
be down that take you
whatever<00:04:04.609> blocks<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:05.060> lot<00:04:07.870> probably<00:04:08.870> whatever

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
whatever blocks a lot probably whatever

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.129 
whatever blocks a lot probably whatever
building<00:04:09.590> material<00:04:10.040> you're<00:04:10.220> using<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:11.139> put

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
building material you're using and put

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.610 
building material you're using and put
one<00:04:12.379> right<00:04:12.560> Ella<00:04:12.769> alloy<00:04:13.250> wire<00:04:13.700> in<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.939> bottom

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
one right Ella alloy wire in the bottom

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.900 
one right Ella alloy wire in the bottom
the<00:04:15.620> one<00:04:15.829> color<00:04:16.070> why<00:04:16.340> are<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:16.669> set<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:19.609> block

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
the one color why are you set the block

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.629 
the one color why are you set the block
up<00:04:20.150> from<00:04:20.479> awesome<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:21.769> you're<00:04:21.919> gonna<00:04:22.130> cable

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
up from awesome but you're gonna cable

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.920 
up from awesome but you're gonna cable
in<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.820> middle<00:04:24.099> right<00:04:25.099> here<00:04:26.090> here<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:28.930> run

in the middle right here here you run

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.540 
in the middle right here here you run
your<00:04:30.110> final<00:04:30.380> cabin<00:04:31.960> yeah<00:04:34.509> until<00:04:35.509> you're<00:04:35.720> in

not gonna show you how to make sick

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.170 
not gonna show you how to make sick
brain<00:04:39.800> motors<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.639> video<00:04:41.530> because<00:04:43.180> it's

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
brain motors in this video because it's

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.969 
brain motors in this video because it's
kind<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.750> complicated<00:04:45.080> it's<00:04:45.560> an<00:04:45.650> entirely

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
kind of complicated it's an entirely

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:58.439 
kind of complicated it's an entirely
different<00:04:46.130> deal<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:50.199> no<00:04:54.610> plus<00:04:55.610> side<00:04:56.409> two<00:04:57.409> three

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
different deal so no plus side two three

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.159 
different deal so no plus side two three
four<00:04:59.620> five<00:05:01.389> and<00:05:02.389> one<00:05:02.750> thing<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.050> I've

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
four five and one thing that I've

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.710 
four five and one thing that I've
noticed<00:05:03.199> is<00:05:03.710> if<00:05:04.039> you're<00:05:04.280> counting<00:05:04.539> it'll<00:05:05.539> seem

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
noticed is if you're counting it'll seem

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.350 
noticed is if you're counting it'll seem
like<00:05:05.810> six<00:05:06.260> because<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.490> first<00:05:07.760> one<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.120> still

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
like six because the first one it still

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.480 
like six because the first one it still
makes<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.659> sound<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:09.949> doesn't<00:05:10.310> make<00:05:10.460> a

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
makes a sound but it doesn't make a

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.300 
makes a sound but it doesn't make a
redstone<00:05:10.880> signal<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:12.610> really<00:05:13.610> do<00:05:13.760> anything<00:05:15.310> so

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
redstone signal so really do anything so

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.890 
redstone signal so really do anything so
I'll<00:05:16.699> probably<00:05:16.909> make<00:05:17.150> another<00:05:17.300> video<00:05:17.599> later

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
I'll probably make another video later

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.129 
I'll probably make another video later
and<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.560> how<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:19.690> do<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:21.020> frame<00:05:21.710> motors<00:05:23.139> and

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
and on how to do the frame motors and

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.550 
and on how to do the frame motors and
probably<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.620> made<00:05:25.010> an<00:05:25.130> elevator<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.560> thanks

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
probably I made an elevator to so thanks

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.520 
probably I made an elevator to so thanks
for<00:05:27.680> watching<00:05:28.010> bye
