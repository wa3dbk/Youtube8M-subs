team zero bloom Slayer countdown game I
go<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.840> 15<00:00:31.289> kills<00:00:31.560> something

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
go I think I get like 15 kills something

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.110 
go I think I get like 15 kills something
like<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.360> pretty<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.200> game

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
like that I do pretty well in this game

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.220 
like that I do pretty well in this game
but<00:00:36.120> that's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.390> gonna<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> point<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.110> I'm

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
but that's not gonna be the point so I'm

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
but that's not gonna be the point so I'm
gonna<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.500> comparing<00:00:38.399> Halo<00:00:39.059> Reach<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.510> halo<00:00:39.719> 4

now<00:00:40.140> obviously<00:00:40.469> halo<00:00:40.710> 4<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> better<00:00:41.520> game

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
now obviously halo 4 is the better game

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
now obviously halo 4 is the better game
and<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> most<00:00:42.780> preferred<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> more

preferred<00:00:43.860> game<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.219> choice<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
preferred game of choice just because of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
preferred game of choice just because of
the<00:00:45.480> playlists<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.930> stuff<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.350> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the playlists and stuff like that but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400 
the playlists and stuff like that but
I'm<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.700> gonna<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.910> comparing<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> two<00:00:48.539> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

I'm still gonna be comparing the two now
the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:50.039> why<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.239> kinda<00:00:51.239> miss<00:00:51.570> Halo<00:00:52.170> Reach

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the reason why I kinda miss Halo Reach

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
the reason why I kinda miss Halo Reach
was<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.160> YouTube<00:00:53.730> friendly

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
was because it was very YouTube friendly

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
was because it was very YouTube friendly
it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.270> very<00:00:54.600> very<00:00:54.840> easy<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.010> gameplays

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it was very very easy to get gameplays

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
it was very very easy to get gameplays
mainly<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> over<00:00:57.750> powerless<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
mainly because of the over powerless of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
mainly because of the over powerless of
the<00:00:59.039> power<00:00:59.309> weapons<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.629> example<00:01:00.690> on

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the power weapons like for example on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.219 
the power weapons like for example on
countdown<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> great<00:01:02.010> example<00:01:03.229> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
countdown which is a great example the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.899 
countdown which is a great example the
shotgun<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> sword<00:01:05.369> you'll<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.760> use

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
shotgun and the sword you'll see me use

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000 
shotgun and the sword you'll see me use
the<00:01:06.030> shotgun<00:01:06.260> constantly<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> game<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the shotgun constantly in this game and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.030 
the shotgun constantly in this game and
even<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> sword<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.350> used

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
even with the sword as the most used

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
even with the sword as the most used
power<00:01:11.310> weapon<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.939> countdown<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.860> prefer

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
shotgun over the sword just because of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
going to be incorporating I think Forge

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.240 
going to be incorporating I think Forge
maps<00:02:43.709> within<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> next<00:02:44.489> few<00:02:44.730> months

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
maps within the next few months

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.800 
maps within the next few months
well<00:02:47.250> within<00:02:47.550> halo<00:02:48.030> 4<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.720> be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
well within halo 4 so are going to be

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.020 
well within halo 4 so are going to be
getting<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.410> more<00:02:49.440> Maps<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> can't

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
getting a lot more Maps so I can't

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.370 
getting a lot more Maps so I can't
really<00:02:51.180> give<00:02:51.510> an<00:02:51.660> accurate<00:02:51.959> assumption<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
really give an accurate assumption I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.199 
really give an accurate assumption I
mean<00:02:52.530> may<00:02:52.920> make<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> follow-up<00:02:53.580> video<00:02:53.760> one

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
mean may make a follow-up video one

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.420 
mean may make a follow-up video one
those<00:02:54.360> fortune<00:02:54.660> has<00:02:54.810> come<00:02:55.019> out<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:56.040> at<00:02:56.250> them

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
those fortune has come out but at them

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.009 
those fortune has come out but at them
at<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.820> point<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.360> believe<00:02:57.660> Halo<00:02:57.989> Reach

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
at this point I do believe Halo Reach

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.350 
at this point I do believe Halo Reach
has<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.980> better<00:02:59.250> Maps

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
has the better Maps

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.690 
has the better Maps
for<00:03:00.660> example<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.380> Asylum<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.220> great

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
for example you know Asylum is a great

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.270 
for example you know Asylum is a great
map<00:03:02.910> sanctuary<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> great<00:03:04.290> map

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
map sanctuary is a great map

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.740 
map sanctuary is a great map
I<00:03:05.310> thought<00:03:05.700> countdown<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> great<00:03:06.450> map<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I thought countdown was a great map I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
I thought countdown was a great map I
don't<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.930> why<00:03:07.050> everyone<00:03:07.470> hated<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.820> had

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
don't know why everyone hated it it had

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.430 
don't know why everyone hated it it had
a<00:03:08.970> lot<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> choke<00:03:09.750> points<00:03:09.989> where<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> guys<00:03:10.290> can

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
a lot of choke points where you guys can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.590 
a lot of choke points where you guys can
get<00:03:10.590> kills<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.850> had<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> lot<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.269> power

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
get kills and I had a lot of power

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.790 
get kills and I had a lot of power
weapon<00:03:12.959> control<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.410> didn't<00:03:13.590> control

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
weapon control if you didn't control

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.440 
weapon control if you didn't control
that<00:03:14.010> those<00:03:14.280> power<00:03:14.519> weapons<00:03:14.880> they<00:03:15.030> kind<00:03:15.330> of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that those power weapons they kind of

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.540 
that those power weapons they kind of
you<00:03:15.870> know<00:03:15.959> resulted<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.010> losing<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> game

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
you know resulted in you losing the game

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.319 
you know resulted in you losing the game
so<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.450> really<00:03:18.720> uh<00:03:19.730> really<00:03:20.730> focused<00:03:21.150> on

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
so it really uh really focused on

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.819 
so it really uh really focused on
getting<00:03:21.690> those<00:03:21.780> power<00:03:21.959> weapons<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.470> holding

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
getting those power weapons and holding

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.840 
getting those power weapons and holding
holding<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.820> lead<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.070> think<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.549> Halo

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
holding the lead so I think that Halo

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.479 
holding the lead so I think that Halo
Reach<00:03:26.880> has<00:03:27.090> had<00:03:27.269> by<00:03:28.140> far<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.860> better<00:03:29.040> map<00:03:29.310> so

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
Reach has had by far the better map so

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.280 
Reach has had by far the better map so
far<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> core<00:03:31.890> gameplay<00:03:32.600> now<00:03:33.600> let's<00:03:34.140> go

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
far so the core gameplay now let's go

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.870 
far so the core gameplay now let's go
back<00:03:34.470> two<00:03:35.010> or<00:03:35.040> three<00:03:35.310> years<00:03:35.430> ago<00:03:35.459> when<00:03:35.700> Halo

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
back two or three years ago when Halo

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.190 
back two or three years ago when Halo
Reach<00:03:35.910> first<00:03:36.269> came<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.720> core<00:03:36.930> gameplay

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
Reach first came out the core gameplay
