00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 we have today I want him to talk to him 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 of something called proximo which is 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.680
 done by kensington and also you have 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.800
 noticed the camera does not move I have a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.099
 Tripod what it's proximo 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.680
 proximo it's a system that exists on 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.690
 several variants in several in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.640
 several variants including one that is a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.539
 keyring like that with a button 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 ours is a small medallion not know 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 how could we call him for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 differentiate from the keychain that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 works in bluetooth 4.0 which 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 communicates with a German iphone in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 any case for the moment I could 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 try it with the iphone I do not know 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 if an android application that exists 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.140
 what does it do this little 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.059
 accessory small accessory bah in fact 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.050
 he will be able to communicate with 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.160
 the smartphone do not own for 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.800
 alerted when we move away when we 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.239
 must be both eg me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 it's on my bunch of keys 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 if I love my trousseau too much 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.720
 phone the phone or the keychain 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.010
 can start ringing 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.260
 I can also when I lost my 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.939
 phone 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.920
 press the small button and wait 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 that my iphone starts screaming with the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 smile the police who has a button there that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.320
 means that that includes stack that has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 it's pretty simple to install and there is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.829
 an application for that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.280
 meaux which is also in the format 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.590
 iphone 5 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.799
 when I launch it then check it 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.259
 have a contact with my little sensor and 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:46.490
 the other I have two I can find 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:48.469
 alas sometimes hilson and blink am here 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.329
 they are strong enough 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.670
 then there is the one you can tie 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.009
 on bags by the volumes I have a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 bag 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.950
 watch your eyes because we're going out 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.789
 practical trick of the camera hedge for 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.780
 film this focus yourself 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.520
 I have one vote will be hounded him I 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.489
 find that they are not strong enough in 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.599
 a silent apartment is 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.069
 enough but if you are in a 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.170
 environment a little noisy like 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 a bar something else but no chance of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.099
 know where only the object pass the thing 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.660
 a little pity 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.910
 and after on the application one can 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.860
 set alarm for you will not miss 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.639
 maybe make an update on 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.639
 my iphone do it like that huh 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.510
 and when I put alarm here of being able 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.100
 define a level of language that makes that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.519
 if the level of proximity of this call 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.380
 of this item goes under the red bar 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.489
 it will start to sound what will 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.940
 consider that I am too far 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.840
 good after we can settle a whole lot of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.709
 it's pretty damn good 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.480
 there are the ringtones the sensitivity of 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.400
 the tear 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 this is minimal sensitivity or 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.329
 maximum sensitivity for that sounds 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.019
 very quickly when there is no more caen 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.019
 it captures more 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.520
 yeah so that's all in all it's 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.880
 rather well above we come in this 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.580
 meaning there not too much if the focus of 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.980
 my device works but we'll see 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.030
 the video may be more and so 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 as I said earlier and a 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.570
 sheep on this one the difference of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.120
 the one on my bag that lets you 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.040
 ring with each other it requires 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.750
 the whole is illuminated on your 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 iphone and that the application proximo be 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.650
 installed but the interest is I parked 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.650
 my iphone i have more there 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.580
 and he starts making a ridiculous sum 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.980
 does not prevent it's not bad you have and waiting 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.360
 look and I find this thing rather than a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.540
 year I think it may still be 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.920
 more about nana who moreover 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.860
 trend that I liked having bags 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.070
 just like that so we fall besides 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.200
 maybe a little bit in a clichÃ© and I 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:08.210
 been surprised quite positively by 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.250
 the price of this little kit this one who 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.020
 includes a keychain there is more in the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.540
 box what am I using it and 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.200
 the one I call a medallion for 50 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.370
 euros so not too expensive last thing 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.850
 that I forgot to mention who is 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.830
 still not bad 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.360
 if you do not use the larva it's up to 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.190
 say does not sound real-time sounded 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.860
 iphone or the keychain when both 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.840
 are too far away the application is going 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.490
 still be able to remember to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.950
 what time were they in contact 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 for the last time with the object of 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.890
 blows for example you leave your keys 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.270
 at the office you leave the office and then 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.970
 arriving at the house of the shepherd 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.570
 panic but actually by launching it 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.850
 application 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.900
 we will be able to see on a map what 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.970
 in law 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.470
 there was the communication that was 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.500
 recorded by the last time this is 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:00.820
 rather well fucked it's called proximo 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.820
