because I love this calf wrap that has

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
because I love this calf wrap that has
the<00:01:43.070> break-in<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.579> outer<00:01:44.820> wrap<00:01:45.240> it

of<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.350> prefer<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.920> opposed<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> one

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
of it I prefer as opposed to the one

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.370 
of it I prefer as opposed to the one
piece<00:01:55.700> other<00:01:56.700> than<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.719> strapping<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
piece other than that my strapping is a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.280 
piece other than that my strapping is a
little<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:58.799> modified<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.210> wear<00:02:00.930> big<00:02:01.140> knee

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
little bit modified but I wear big knee

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170 
little bit modified but I wear big knee
pads<00:02:01.560> from<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> big<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
pads from you know I like the big of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
pads from you know I like the big of
wide<00:02:03.329> open<00:02:03.360> cradle<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> nothing<00:02:05.640> gets<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
wide open cradle so nothing gets in the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.119 
wide open cradle so nothing gets in the
way<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> XL<00:02:08.459> tees<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:10.890> here

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
way but the XL tees that we got here

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.970 
way but the XL tees that we got here

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940 
it's
this<00:02:12.670> essentially<00:02:13.270> one's<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:14.260> uh<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this essentially one's for uh you know a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.650 
this essentially one's for uh you know a
stiffer<00:02:15.550> pad<00:02:15.849> where<00:02:16.120> another<00:02:16.360> would<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.569> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
stiffer pad where another would be a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.280 
stiffer pad where another would be a
softer<00:02:17.140> more<00:02:17.770> hybrid<00:02:18.220> pad<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:19.440> there<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.560> is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
softer more hybrid pad but there it is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.089 
softer more hybrid pad but there it is
