00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.580 
can see it's nicely mounted on the top
there<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.840> go

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.400 

but<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:36.060> found<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.480> problem<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:37.200> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
but I have found a problem with this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
but I have found a problem with this
setup<00:02:37.709> now<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.610> strange<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:39.120> only<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.930> one

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
setup now it's strange it only is on one

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
setup now it's strange it only is on one
of<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.440> speakers<00:02:40.800> now<00:02:40.950> tiny<00:02:41.550> sticks<00:02:41.790> drawn

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
of the speakers now tiny sticks drawn

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.479 
of the speakers now tiny sticks drawn
here<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:43.709> don't<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:43.920> any<00:02:44.160> interference

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
here we don't have any interference

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.089 
here we don't have any interference
coming<00:02:44.910> through<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> speaker<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.830> if

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
coming through the speaker at all but if

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.660 
coming through the speaker at all but if
we<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.430> over<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.819> speaker<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
we go over to this speaker over here and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.530 
we go over to this speaker over here and
turn<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.910> vertigo<00:02:52.099> listen<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
turn on the vertigo listen to that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.600 
turn on the vertigo listen to that
there's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.750> really<00:02:54.810> tool<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.370> found

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
there's not really tool now I have found

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.699 
there's not really tool now I have found
the<00:02:56.730> solution<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.390> basically<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.560> was

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the solution to this basically it was

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.460 
the solution to this basically it was
running<00:02:58.920> off<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.160> same<00:02:59.519> power<00:02:59.970> supply<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
running off the same power supply as the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.009 
running off the same power supply as the
speaker<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.670> now<00:03:02.849> running<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.480> Vertigo's

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
speaker so I'm now running the Vertigo's

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.270 
speaker so I'm now running the Vertigo's
off<00:03:04.260> four<00:03:04.379> different<00:03:04.470> power<00:03:04.680> supply<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.099> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
off four different power supply to the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.430 
off four different power supply to the
speaker<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.849> I've<00:03:05.940> had<00:03:06.090> no<00:03:06.120> problem<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:06.989> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
speaker and I've had no problem with the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.430 
speaker and I've had no problem with the
interference<00:03:08.069> again<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.989> there<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:10.319> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
interference again so there you go that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.259 
interference again so there you go that
is<00:03:10.500> how<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.709> melt<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.370> lighting<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.849> X<00:03:12.030> onto

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
is how to melt your lighting of X onto

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.940 
is how to melt your lighting of X onto
your<00:03:12.660> speaker<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.680> will<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:13.920> course

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
