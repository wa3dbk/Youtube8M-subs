00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.740 
lose and this could go either way I see
him<00:04:09.979> one<00:04:10.250> maybe<00:04:10.639> he<00:04:10.849> wins<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.359> he<00:04:11.419> has<00:04:11.599> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
him one maybe he wins and he has the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.869 
him one maybe he wins and he has the
title<00:04:12.139> so<00:04:12.709> for<00:04:12.949> the<00:04:13.009> next<00:04:13.069> couple<00:04:13.400> months<00:04:13.639> he

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
title so for the next couple months he

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.089 
title so for the next couple months he
has<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.299> he<00:04:14.329> wins<00:04:14.629> he<00:04:14.870> wins<00:04:15.079> he<00:04:15.259> wins<00:04:15.439> and<00:04:15.709> then

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
night he gets it back and that's kind of

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.699 
night he gets it back and that's kind of
a<00:04:19.669> foolproof<00:04:19.909> way<00:04:20.299> for<00:04:21.019> him<00:04:21.139> to<00:04:21.169> always<00:04:21.560> keep

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.430 
a foolproof way for him to always keep
the<00:04:21.889> title<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.969> know<00:04:23.000> he<00:04:23.570> gets<00:04:23.779> a<00:04:23.870> rematch<00:04:24.200> he

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
the title you know he gets a rematch he

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.170 
the title you know he gets a rematch he
uses<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.070> say<00:04:25.400> he<00:04:25.669> uses

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
uses it and say he uses

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.820 
uses it and say he uses
rematch<00:04:26.690> clause<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.139> he<00:04:27.229> loses<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.590> rhema

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
rematch clause and he loses the rhema

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.740 
rematch clause and he loses the rhema

actually cash it in at the briefcase BAM
he's<00:04:30.020> got<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.289> title<00:04:30.530> back<00:04:30.740> there's<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.639> many

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
he's got the title back there's so many

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.249 
he's got the title back there's so many
opportunities<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.660> they<00:04:32.690> could<00:04:32.870> go<00:04:33.050> with

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
opportunities that they could go with

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.480 
opportunities that they could go with
that<00:04:33.410> if<00:04:33.590> he<00:04:33.680> had<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.889> title<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.430> the

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
that if he had the title and the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.580 
that if he had the title and the
briefcase<00:04:34.820> because<00:04:35.630> technically<00:04:36.169> he<00:04:36.380> never

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
briefcase because technically he never

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.170 
briefcase because technically he never
cashed<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.190> which<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.580> think<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.060> would<00:04:38.120> be
