00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.160
 I think it would become a good tradition to do 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.920
 Reviews on the best games from the category 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.289
 new products of the week in one category and price 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.240
 or have looked narrowly in the second have already received 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.600
 not only detailed information but also 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.029
 opinions of the editorial board itself in the person of me and this to 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.250
 the fact that once again after 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.820
 news comes out a review of the game which 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.249
 there flashed and today it is colorful 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.050
 clockwork runner called skyline 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.940
 skaters review on which you are kind 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.940
 provides the pdalife channel 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.790
 First of all I want to note that as 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.460
 whatever it is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.470
 we are dealing with a typical runner be allowed 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.260
 mad all sorts of balls and garlands on 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.560
 most do not indulge so special miracles not 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.530
 wait the game is nothing more than ideological 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.630
 sequel of popular subway surfers with 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 the only difference is that there is a kind of arcade 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.030
 platformer unlike 3d subway in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 the rest of the subject, too, we have a bunch 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.560
 skaters for which from something 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.320
 chasing a police helicopter I apparently 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.990
 for jumping on the roofs and the playerâ€™s task is not 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.810
 let him catch us up for this leopard 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.810
 do you have two kinds of jumps lower 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.700
 and higher well, and a bunch of different boosters 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.460
 some of which are scattered right on 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.560
 level or sold for the currency that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.170
 words on god in the game as much as 2 and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.149
 nobody was surprised by his majesty donat 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.640
 the game has not bypassed although not fatal 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.330
 main stumbling block succeeded 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.270
 to avoid 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.880
 no restrictions on races there 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.250
 my gas energy and just no karma 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.270
 ride as you like although there is 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.360
 claim to skating itself even though it is 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.509
 runner but this is exactly the runner that 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.940
 get bored of what that is, whether in 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.610
 subway surfers could be recorded in days 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.310
 here unfortunately because of the migration of pseudo 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.500
 2d gone either highlight toolwiz care to 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.899
 yes and eyes honestly very quickly 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.540
 tired of side scrolling the game is not 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.300
 at least enough diversity levels 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.250
 uniformity quickly bored with 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 gameplay and its problems figured out 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
 but what else do I propose a game other than 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 constant jumps we are free here 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.069
 discover new characters besides 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.610
 appearance is nothing in the gameplay 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.800
 not bring still can not buy the board well, 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.599
 Here is the situation with them a little more fun 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.790
 each board except the unique external 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.040
 view gives a bonus to certain actions 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.500
 whether it be jumping or just 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.709
 collecting coins the character itself along the way 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.349
 pumping does not affect the ride to 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.120
 Sorry candid pussy measures 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.400
 character is no more 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.950
 and the last point I would like to evaluate 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.349
 game in terms of graphics and sound 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.140
 visually the game wouldn't say that 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.590
 masterpiece rather stylish and and style 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.569
 This amateur some kind of cartoons little 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 polygonal visual range is very 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.440
 cool painted 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 and what if the picture may seem 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.239
 too juicy which in turn again 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.909
 same beats on sight and here is the animation of the world 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.099
 I liked it here and the birds on the roofs and 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.040
 the clouds in the distance are pretty pretty 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.459
 and neatly the music matches the general 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 style 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.489
 no hardcore here you will not hear so 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.739
 something neutral is not particularly 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.739
 memorable but not yet 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.930
 annoying what's up to my personal 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.090
 opinions as a person who is not really 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.159
 recognizes runners as a full-fledged genre in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.500
 games but rather like various bonus 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.769
 levels more serious homes up 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.840
 the game is stupid for half an hour and then you just 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.659
 for constant advertising soars and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.829
 extortion likes or given that is 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.139
 more interesting and high quality 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.989
 early and andrew are not limited 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.419
 just jumps look at the channel they 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.730
 have she sim all with you was kinat and 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.359
 video review of the game skyline skaters 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.359
 soon
