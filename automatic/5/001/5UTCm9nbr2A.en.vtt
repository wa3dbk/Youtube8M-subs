00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
paper completely caught my eye and i

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
paper completely caught my eye and i
knew<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.960> i<00:00:22.170> wanted<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.529> use<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.640> this

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
knew that i wanted to use that for this

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.689 
knew that i wanted to use that for this
particular<00:00:24.500> layout<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.430> i<00:00:26.460> went<00:00:26.609> ahead

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
particular layout and so i went ahead

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
particular layout and so i went ahead
and<00:00:26.849> i<00:00:27.029> knew<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.840> bit<00:00:28.050> too

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and i knew it would be a little bit too

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.359 
and i knew it would be a little bit too
much<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> probably<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> whole<00:00:29.160> thing

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
much to probably use the whole thing

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.800 
much to probably use the whole thing
although<00:00:29.699> some<00:00:29.939> people<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.330> make<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> work

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
although some people can make that work

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
although some people can make that work
but<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.289> felt<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.390> too<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.570> for

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
but i felt like it would be too much for

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.420 
but i felt like it would be too much for
me<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> wouldn't<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.620> how<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
me or I wouldn't know how to make that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.990 
me or I wouldn't know how to make that
work<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.750> taste<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.700> otherwise<00:00:38.700> I've

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
work for my taste and so otherwise I've

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
work for my taste and so otherwise I've
seen<00:00:39.239> people<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.170> seen<00:00:40.379> people<00:00:40.500> use

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
seen people well I've seen people use

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.530 
seen people well I've seen people use
like<00:00:41.070> full<00:00:41.340> patterns<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> they

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
like full patterns like this and they

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
like full patterns like this and they
can<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> great<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.370> reason

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
can do it great but I for some reason

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
can do it great but I for some reason
have<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.390> bit<00:00:45.480> more<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> difficult

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
have a little bit more of a difficult

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.770 
have a little bit more of a difficult
time<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.190> decided<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> use<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.629> at

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
time with that so I decided to use it at

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.880 
time with that so I decided to use it at
like<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.559> say<00:00:49.800> um<00:00:50.539> at<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> top<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.289> guess

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like I would say um at the top I guess

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.500 
like I would say um at the top I guess
the<00:00:53.039> top<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> page<00:00:53.699> although<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> doesn't

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the top of the page although it doesn't

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
the top of the page although it doesn't
take<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.840> quite<00:00:55.110> half<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.640> does

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
take up quite half of it but it does

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
take up quite half of it but it does
take<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.930> over<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> quarter<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
take up like a little over a quarter and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.150 
take up like a little over a quarter and

just<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> mess<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.689> sometimes<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just like a mess and so sometimes that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
just like a mess and so sometimes that
just<00:01:49.619> works<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.189> me<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> title<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
just works for me and so the title of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
just works for me and so the title of
the<00:01:51.180> layout<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the layout is going to be I think it's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.649 
the layout is going to be I think it's
beautiful<00:01:53.070> mess<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> beautiful<00:01:54.360> mess<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
beautiful mess or a beautiful mess I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
beautiful mess or a beautiful mess I
can't<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:54.990> remember<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> used<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
can't really remember so I used that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.440 
can't really remember so I used that

first<00:02:05.009> part<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> title<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:05.880> I'm

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
within sometimes I am have a hard time

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.890 
within sometimes I am have a hard time
with<00:06:03.219> just<00:06:03.430> leaving<00:06:03.789> them<00:06:03.939> simple<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.659> so

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
with just leaving them simple and so

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.959 
with just leaving them simple and so
with<00:06:05.560> this<00:06:05.650> particular<00:06:05.860> one<00:06:06.340> I<00:06:06.370> wasn't<00:06:06.699> sure

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
with this particular one I wasn't sure

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.159 
with this particular one I wasn't sure
what<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.210> wanted<00:06:07.389> to<00:06:07.569> do<00:06:09.419> so<00:06:10.419> the<00:06:10.599> tray<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:11.050> I'm

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
what I wanted to do so the tray that I'm

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.679 
what I wanted to do so the tray that I'm
pulling<00:06:11.590> out<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:12.039> pulling<00:06:12.699> my<00:06:12.939> femora<00:06:13.330> out<00:06:13.479> of

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
pulling out of pulling my femora out of

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.320 
pulling out of pulling my femora out of
those<00:06:14.199> trays<00:06:14.770> are<00:06:14.949> from<00:06:15.129> the<00:06:15.460> dollar<00:06:15.639> spot<00:06:16.000> at

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
those trays are from the dollar spot at

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.790 
those trays are from the dollar spot at
target<00:06:16.840> I<00:06:16.960> think<00:06:17.169> that<00:06:17.289> they<00:06:17.409> were<00:06:17.469> only<00:06:17.650> a

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
target I think that they were only a

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.670 
target I think that they were only a
dollar<00:06:17.889> they<00:06:18.729> were<00:06:18.789> either<00:06:19.000> a<00:06:19.509> dollar<00:06:20.409> or

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
dollar they were either a dollar or

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.869 
dollar they were either a dollar or
three<00:06:20.889> dollars<00:06:21.009> i<00:06:21.370> think<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.699> they<00:06:21.819> were

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
three dollars i think that they were

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.969 
three dollars i think that they were
only<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.210> dollar<00:06:22.270> though<00:06:22.750> they've<00:06:23.409> really<00:06:23.740> come

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
only a dollar though they've really come

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.469 
only a dollar though they've really come
in<00:06:24.340> handy<00:06:24.659> so<00:06:25.770> I've<00:06:26.770> been<00:06:26.949> kind<00:06:27.219> of<00:06:27.280> used<00:06:27.879> about

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919
