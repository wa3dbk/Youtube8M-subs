00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
a nice diversity to the gameplay

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.890 
a nice diversity to the gameplay
although<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.730> all<00:03:16.850> very<00:03:17.090> simple<00:03:17.390> stuff<00:03:17.870> but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
although it's all very simple stuff but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.550 
although it's all very simple stuff but
even<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.100> mean<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.670> don't<00:03:20.450> even<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.870> Pokemon

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
even so I mean I don't even like Pokemon

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.500 
even so I mean I don't even like Pokemon
and<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:21.920> had<00:03:22.100> fun<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.550> this<00:03:22.640> game<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.300> not

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
and I had fun with this game it's not

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.660 
and I had fun with this game it's not
even<00:03:23.750> remotely<00:03:23.959> challenging<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.550> an

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
even remotely challenging but it's an

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.820 
even remotely challenging but it's an
entertaining<00:03:26.239> game<00:03:26.660> set<00:03:27.050> in<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.230> very<00:03:27.410> charming

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
entertaining game set in a very charming

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.640 
entertaining game set in a very charming
world<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.970> fact<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.750> presentation<00:03:30.500> is

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
world and in fact the presentation is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.350 
world and in fact the presentation is
one<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:30.920> its<00:03:31.070> strong<00:03:31.370> points<00:03:31.850> it's<00:03:32.270> not

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
one of its strong points it's not

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.630 
one of its strong points it's not
technically<00:03:33.020> impressive<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.160> graphics

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
technically impressive but the graphics

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.729 
technically impressive but the graphics
are<00:03:34.820> really<00:03:35.030> tastefully<00:03:35.900> done<00:03:36.140> very

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
are really tastefully done very

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.790 
are really tastefully done very
colourful<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.670> vibrant<00:03:37.970> with<00:03:38.420> great<00:03:39.170> Pokemon

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.610 

so<00:03:56.700> what<00:03:56.879> about<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.269> drawbacks<00:03:57.569> well<00:03:58.110> as<00:03:58.440> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
so what about the drawbacks well as you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.400 
so what about the drawbacks well as you
can<00:03:58.739> probably<00:03:58.799> tell<00:03:59.280> it's<00:04:00.060> very<00:04:00.989> repetitive

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
can probably tell it's very repetitive

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.830 
can probably tell it's very repetitive
also<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.340> play<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.000> Wii<00:04:03.180> Remote<00:04:03.569> held

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
sideways and moving with a d-pad in a 3d

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
sideways and moving with a d-pad in a 3d
world<00:04:07.739> can<00:04:08.459> be<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:09.000> clunky<00:04:09.329> but<00:04:09.629> if<00:04:09.810> you're

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
world can be a bit clunky but if you're
