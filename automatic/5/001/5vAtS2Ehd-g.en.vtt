 cases 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.350
 who wants second reading and study 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 when we have felt very well in some of these phenomena the raison d'être of the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 state although -sector what we see in what it consists 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 we have 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.730
 it is a technique that is defined technically in a very simple way 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.729
 that is simply said 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.119
 last Saturday 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:17.579
 the one that has been better postulated take out of the foreign csn 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.799
 visibly if your client 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.379
 has been placed on the soundtrack 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.650
 with dubbing in Spanish with dubbing and an adaptation translation 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.409
 required in this case to Spanish 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.519
 that's the technical discussion about what is the dubbing of Moscow 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.669
 we are 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:43.869
 we do not want that definition so technical so cold where to leave aside 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.879
 before the act 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.469
 the reinterpretation that the dubbing actor like that 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.949
 the sea each of its characters 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:52.939
 she 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.730
 you have to adapt this act although the rhythm still by way of doing it differently 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:05.650
 at its own pace it could have to interpret a character d entirely 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.569
 with my body with mons with solutions and everything I have in this case the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.109
 voice dubbing this interpretation for mediocrity bush 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.309
 of all attitude 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.379
 the emotions the nuances 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 the investment in history to be able to tell the story 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.569
 dfb but cautious and visual 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.749
 since when between those three precisely to work on what this 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.919
 your profession 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:40.680
 and if you have any memory of what was in general in history goose 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.919
 4th of the special one that brought footwear 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.219
 the memories 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.189
 I'll look 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.010
 I joined the 86 in 1986 after finishing the education degree 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.039

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.609
 we finish well working as always 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.799
 well not independent theater and then Latino employees 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:09.229
 a person 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.309
 percent in April when I remember their names she was the one that took her 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.339
 ahead graciela orozco 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.379
 according to navarro 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:21.250
 finally I bonus the creation of that one studies that was called disorders 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.190
 and I introduce myself to the directors and started working with them with messi 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.419
 I started doing 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.050
 none of the first links know 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.939

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.349
 a Latin phrase 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.219
 so this is injured people his mom was at the finish line and 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.289
 then he had to say 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.110
 china like me 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.569
 as if from a setback 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.599
 honestly I was not used to washington eu - a judge of new york 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.569

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.779
 very lucky 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.479
