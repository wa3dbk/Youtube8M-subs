00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.930 

story-wise

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
story-wise

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.310 
story-wise
it's<00:04:42.330> really<00:04:42.930> really<00:04:43.580> blah<00:04:44.910> really<00:04:45.320> there's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
it's really really blah really there's

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.740 
it's really really blah really there's
not<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.650> much<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.130> story<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.910> it's

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
not really much of a story to it it's

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.570 
not really much of a story to it it's
not<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> greatest<00:04:49.320> story<00:04:49.680> ever<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.370> actually

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
not the greatest story ever I actually

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.780 
not the greatest story ever I actually
like<00:04:50.940> calling<00:04:51.390> better<00:04:51.630> than<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:53.250> particular

like calling better than this particular
game<00:04:54.060> um<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:55.940> guess<00:04:56.940> that's<00:04:57.150> really<00:04:57.450> about<00:04:57.630> it

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
was that I can say because I don't

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.140 
was that I can say because I don't
really<00:05:02.190> want<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.370> spoil<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> story<00:05:02.700> this<00:05:03.000> to
