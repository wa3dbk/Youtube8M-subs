00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
right the passive still stands but this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
right the passive still stands but this
is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> new<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.280> strut<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
is the new thing about it strut now is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
is the new thing about it strut now is
increased<00:00:45.539> scaling<00:00:45.899> based<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.320> level<00:00:46.800> which

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
increased scaling based on level which

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
increased scaling based on level which
is<00:00:47.280> awesome<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:48.420> falls<00:00:48.690> off<00:00:48.899> when

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is awesome and only falls off when

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.470 
is awesome and only falls off when
misfortune<00:00:49.289> takes<00:00:49.860> direct<00:00:50.480> non-periodic

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
misfortune takes direct non-periodic

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.740 
misfortune takes direct non-periodic
damage<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> doesn't<00:00:53.789> fall<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
damage so it doesn't fall off all the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.369 
damage so it doesn't fall off all the
time<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> used<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:57.140> it's<00:00:58.140> also

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
was taken out of this i don't really

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
was taken out of this i don't really
like<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.920> something

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
like that but that's really something

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
like that but that's really something
they<00:01:47.430> took<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> game<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:49.079> are

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.859 
they took out of the game that they are
taking<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> game<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> lot<00:01:50.369> nowadays
