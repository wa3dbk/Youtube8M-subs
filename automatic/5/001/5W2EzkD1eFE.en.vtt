you're going to use these numbers right
here<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.030> code<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.780> soon<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
here for that code so as soon as you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.240 
here for that code so as soon as you
turn<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.939> it'll<00:01:53.939> say<00:01:54.270> use<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.049> code<00:01:55.350> 99<00:01:55.950> so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
turn it on it'll say use this code 99 so

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370

you'll<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.579> nine<00:01:56.850> nine<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you'll do nine nine and then if it's the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
you'll do nine nine and then if it's the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
then down and that will pair the device

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.729 
then down and that will pair the device
when<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.990> main<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.290> joy

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
actual arcades and these buttons they

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.860 
actual arcades and these buttons they
don't<00:04:56.530> have<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.950> right<00:04:57.270> slope<00:04:58.270> inside<00:04:58.690> the

don't have the right slope inside the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.620 
don't have the right slope inside the
concave<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:00.669> they<00:05:00.790> are<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.940> bit<00:05:01.240> flat<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:03.630> this

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
concave so they are a bit flat and this

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.190 
concave so they are a bit flat and this
feels<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.080> it's<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:07.180> will<00:05:07.570> take<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.780> beating

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
feels like it's it will take a beating

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.400 
feels like it's it will take a beating
but<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.650> does<00:05:09.160> feel<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.400> little<00:05:09.700> cheap<00:05:10.289> but<00:05:11.289> it

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
but it does feel a little cheap but it

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.440 
but it does feel a little cheap but it
is<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:12.010> know<00:05:12.870> only<00:05:13.870> $49.99<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.340> this<00:05:16.120> does

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
is you know only $49.99 so this does

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.550 
is you know only $49.99 so this does
have<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.840> little<00:05:17.830> fake<00:05:18.190> $0.25<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:20.289> just

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
have a little fake $0.25 and that just

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.529 
have a little fake $0.25 and that just
lets<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.430> know<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.760> there<00:05:21.910> is<00:05:22.030> power<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.389> the

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
lets you know that there is power to the

device<00:05:22.960> there<00:05:23.650> is<00:05:23.680> no<00:05:23.979> on<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.430> off<00:05:24.520> switch<00:05:24.760> so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
device there is no on and off switch so

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:48.580 
device there is no on and off switch so
you<00:05:26.620> just<00:05:29.550> press<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.580> button<00:05:30.850> you<00:05:30.970> know<00:05:31.120> turn<00:05:31.510> on
