00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.189 

I'm<00:00:00.089> going<00:00:00.269> to<00:00:00.329> go<00:00:00.420> ahead<00:00:00.480> and<00:00:00.690> set<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.930> rear

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
I'm going to go ahead and set the rear

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.470 
I'm going to go ahead and set the rear
wheel<00:00:01.620> alignment<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.730> reason<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.090> made<00:00:03.300> this

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
wheel alignment the reason I made this

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.710 
wheel alignment the reason I made this
video<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.830> because<00:00:04.890> when<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.609> went<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> auto

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
video is because when I went to the auto

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.919 
video is because when I went to the auto
shop<00:00:06.870> they<00:00:07.230> said<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> rear<00:00:07.680> will<00:00:08.099> align<00:00:08.400> them

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
shop they said the rear will align them

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.390 
shop they said the rear will align them
they<00:00:09.929> said<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.200> cost<00:00:10.380> me<00:00:10.590> four<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> five

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
they said it cost me four to five

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.140 
they said it cost me four to five
turnovers<00:00:12.469> I'm<00:00:13.469> not<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.889> successful<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
turnovers I'm not that successful so I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750 
turnovers I'm not that successful so I
decided<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> myself<00:00:16.250> after<00:00:17.250> looking<00:00:17.670> at

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
decided to do it myself after looking at

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.390 
decided to do it myself after looking at
several<00:00:17.940> videos<00:00:18.510> looking<00:00:19.470> at<00:00:19.619> Corvette<00:00:20.100> form

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
several videos looking at Corvette form

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.660 
several videos looking at Corvette form
I<00:00:20.730> figured<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> good<00:00:21.990> way<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.670> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I figured out a good way to do it the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
I figured out a good way to do it the
procedure<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.269> mine<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
procedure is not mine it's actually a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.060 
procedure is not mine it's actually a
combination<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.599> other<00:00:27.599> procedures<00:00:28.560> but

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
combination of you other procedures but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.310 
combination of you other procedures but
it<00:00:29.160> seemed<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> work<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> Corvette<00:00:30.990> at

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it seemed to work for this Corvette at

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
it seemed to work for this Corvette at
least<00:00:31.679> enough<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.279> where<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.790> take<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:32.969> in

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
least enough to where I could take it in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
least enough to where I could take it in
and<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> front<00:00:33.780> wheel<00:00:33.899> alignment<00:00:34.559> which

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and get the front wheel alignment which

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520 
and get the front wheel alignment which
is<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.190> 79<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> 80<00:00:36.180> dollars<00:00:36.630> much

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
is only about 79 to 80 dollars much

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010 
is only about 79 to 80 dollars much
cheaper<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> itself<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.930> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
cheaper if I do it itself what can you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.430 
cheaper if I do it itself what can you
do<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> rear<00:00:41.540> alignment<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
do the rear alignment what I'm going to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.490 
do the rear alignment what I'm going to
do<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.010> take<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> caliper<00:00:44.670> off

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
do is I'm going to take the caliper off

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
do is I'm going to take the caliper off
and<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> caliper<00:00:47.370> off

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and I'm going to take the caliper off

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.319 
and I'm going to take the caliper off
now<00:00:48.149> rotate<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> rotor<00:00:49.640> around<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
now rotate the rotor around so that I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
now rotate the rotor around so that I
have<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> flat<00:00:51.840> surface<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> rotor<00:00:52.920> right

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
have the flat surface of the rotor right

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.500 
have the flat surface of the rotor right
here<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:56.280> I'll<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.879> shims

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here then I'll use these shims

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.010 
here then I'll use these shims
to<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> drilling<00:00:59.100> arm<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.719> make<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to put in the drilling arm to make the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.350 
to put in the drilling arm to make the
adjustment<00:01:01.820> what<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> will<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
adjustment what I will also do is take a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
adjustment what I will also do is take a
nut<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> leaf<00:01:07.320> spring<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
nut off the leaf spring right here and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
nut off the leaf spring right here and
make<00:01:09.119> sure<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> jack<00:01:09.780> under<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> because

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
make sure I put a jack under it because

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
make sure I put a jack under it because
there's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> pressure<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.700> leaf

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there's a lot of pressure on this leaf

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.020 
there's a lot of pressure on this leaf
spring<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> no<00:01:13.740> pressure<00:01:14.040> only

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
spring that way I have no pressure only

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.219 
spring that way I have no pressure only
trailing<00:01:15.450> arm<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.650> I'll<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.950> let<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.250> hang

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
trailing arm and I'll just let that hang

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
trailing arm and I'll just let that hang
up<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> area<00:01:20.159> where<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> trailing

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
up here is the area where the trailing

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.679 
up here is the area where the trailing
arm<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:22.710> shims<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.820> go

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
arm is and these shims right here go

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
arm is and these shims right here go
right<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
right in here like this and then on the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.700 
right in here like this and then on the
other<00:01:27.900> side<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
other side and that's how you get the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.780 
other side and that's how you get the
adjustment<00:01:31.710> between<00:01:32.130> left<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:34.790> before

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
adjustment between left and right before

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.260 
adjustment between left and right before
I<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.950> I'll<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.400> take<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> cotter

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I do that I'll have to take the cotter

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.940 
I do that I'll have to take the cotter
pin<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:41.150> bolt<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> off<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
pin out of this bolt and back it off and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.780 
pin out of this bolt and back it off and
then<00:01:44.040> back<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> nut<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:45.770> by<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> exact

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
then back the nut off by for the exact

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
then back the nut off by for the exact
length<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.630> rim

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
length of the rim

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.070 
length of the rim
I'll<00:01:50.460> put<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> 2x4<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> RAM<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:51.900> want

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
I'll put the 2x4 on the RAM and I want

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'll put the 2x4 on the RAM and I want
it<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.230> be<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:53.280> touch<00:01:53.490> each<00:01:53.730> end<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> rim

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it to be to touch each end of the rim

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.150 
it to be to touch each end of the rim
because<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:55.050> want<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.290> true<00:01:55.530> reading<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
because I want the true reading of the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.870 
because I want the true reading of the
rim<00:01:56.370> now<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.150> deficiencies<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.170> tyre<00:01:58.880> for

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
rim now the deficiencies of the tyre for

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
rim now the deficiencies of the tyre for
example<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.580> this<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.120> take<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.960> level

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
example just like this I take my level

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.940 
example just like this I take my level
put<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.370> level<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.530> what<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.770> looking

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
put a level on it and what I'm looking

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.550 
put a level on it and what I'm looking
for<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.929> balance<00:02:10.560> right<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:12.290> level<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
for is a balance right here level to be

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.400 
for is a balance right here level to be
perfect<00:02:14.030> when<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.480> then<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
perfect when I do that then I know I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.160 
perfect when I do that then I know I
have<00:02:16.770> zero<00:02:17.310> camber<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> level<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.960> at

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
have zero camber and the level is at

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
have zero camber and the level is at
center<00:02:21.650> camera<00:02:22.650> could<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.070> adjusted<00:02:23.580> by

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
center camera could be adjusted by

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.540 
center camera could be adjusted by
turning<00:02:24.920> loosening<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.040> bolt<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.370> here

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
right to increase or decrease camber you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610 
right to increase or decrease camber you
will<00:02:34.740> notice<00:02:35.070> there<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:36.780> each<00:02:37.260> side

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
will notice there is one on each side

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:52.580 
will notice there is one on each side
for<00:02:37.890> each<00:02:38.220> will

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590

now<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.610> do<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.180> make<00:02:54.330> sure

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now what I want to do here is make sure

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.260 
now what I want to do here is make sure
that<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.900> car<00:02:55.260> tracks<00:02:56.030> directly<00:02:57.030> straight

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
that this car tracks directly straight

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.070 
that this car tracks directly straight
down<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.660> road<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.880> took<00:03:00.239> my<00:03:00.510> string<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
down the road so I took my string and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.400 
down the road so I took my string and
put<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> back<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.330> rotor<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
put it on the back of the rotor and I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.520 
put it on the back of the rotor and I
measured<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.520> put<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> straight<00:03:06.060> line

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
measured it and then put a straight line

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.860 
measured it and then put a straight line
down<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.739> side<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.130> Corvette<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
down the side of the Corvette and what I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330 
down the side of the Corvette and what I
did<00:03:10.110> was<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.620> made<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> measurement<00:03:11.250> right

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
did was and I made a measurement right

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.520 
did was and I made a measurement right
here<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.709> back<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> door<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.630> make<00:03:16.349> sure

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
here the back of the door and make sure

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.640 
here the back of the door and make sure
it<00:03:16.709> was<00:03:16.830> flush<00:03:17.099> with<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.370> string<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.470> did

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it was flush with a string then I did

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.180 
it was flush with a string then I did
the<00:03:19.769> same<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.849> front<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> door<00:03:21.540> seam

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the same in the front of the door seam

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.240 
the same in the front of the door seam
right<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.410> I'm<00:03:25.530> sure<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:25.980> was

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
right here and I'm sure that that was

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
right here and I'm sure that that was
the<00:03:26.370> same<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.780> I'll<00:03:27.870> make<00:03:28.019> sure<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the same and I'll make sure that the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160 
the same and I'll make sure that the
string<00:03:28.799> was<00:03:29.010> tight<00:03:29.310> enough<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.870> would

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
string was tight enough so that would

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
string was tight enough so that would
give<00:03:31.319> me<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.500> reading<00:03:31.739> right<00:03:32.040> here<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.640> disc

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
give me a reading right here on the disc

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.220 
give me a reading right here on the disc
I<00:03:33.239> need<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.080> 1/8<00:03:34.530> inch<00:03:34.739> gap<00:03:35.720> from<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> front<00:03:37.080> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
I need a 1/8 inch gap from the front of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.520 
I need a 1/8 inch gap from the front of
the<00:03:37.319> disc<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.640> edge<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> string<00:03:39.599> keep

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the disc to the edge of the string keep

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.670 
the disc to the edge of the string keep
in<00:03:40.680> mind<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.069> back<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.910> string<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.330> flush

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
in mind the back of the string is flush

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.610 
in mind the back of the string is flush
so<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.890> 1/8<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:44.640> here<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:46.319> I'll<00:03:46.440> move

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
so I have 1/8 right here and I'll move

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.229 
so I have 1/8 right here and I'll move
the<00:03:46.830> trailing<00:03:47.250> arm<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.849> forth<00:03:48.090> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the trailing arm back and forth and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.960 
the trailing arm back and forth and
install<00:03:48.599> shims<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.290> get<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.970> what

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
install shims so I get that right what

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.559 
install shims so I get that right what
I'll<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:52.049> measurement<00:03:53.090> right<00:03:54.090> here

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
I'll do is this measurement right here

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.740 
I'll do is this measurement right here
to<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.739> door<00:03:56.180> will<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.450> same

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
to the back of the door will be the same

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.680 
to the back of the door will be the same
as<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.890> other<00:03:59.070> side<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.329> same<00:04:00.540> on

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
as I do the other side and the same on

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.569 
as I do the other side and the same on
the<00:04:00.810> front<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.200> boy<00:04:01.320> if<00:04:01.829> I'm<00:04:02.070> sure<00:04:02.370> that

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
the front of the boy if I'm sure that

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.599 
the front of the boy if I'm sure that
that<00:04:02.640> measurement<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.420> same<00:04:04.489> then<00:04:05.489> I'll

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
that measurement is the same then I'll

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.819 
that measurement is the same then I'll
sure<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.239> side<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.810> car<00:04:07.049> is

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
sure that that side of the car is

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.650 
sure that that side of the car is
tracking<00:04:08.400> directly<00:04:08.940> straight<00:04:09.120> with<00:04:09.480> this

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
tracking directly straight with this

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.270 
tracking directly straight with this
side<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.200> car<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
side of the car and that the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.670 
side of the car and that the
measurements<00:04:11.819> are<00:04:11.970> exactly<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.569> same<00:04:12.780> now

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
measurements are exactly the same now

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.569 
measurements are exactly the same now
take<00:04:13.920> note<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:15.200> all<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.229> did<00:04:16.380> was<00:04:16.709> reverse<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
take note is all I did was reverse the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.969 
take note is all I did was reverse the
rotor<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> flat<00:04:19.140> edge<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.739> rotor

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
rotor so that the flat edge of the rotor

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.020
