00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
to make it look like a branch so I'm

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.240 
to make it look like a branch so I'm
gonna<00:00:41.320> put<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.129> right<00:00:42.159> like<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.070> now

trickiest part is frosting the actual

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.740 
trickiest part is frosting the actual
branch<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.159> stays<00:01:06.610> attached<00:01:07.210> because

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
branch so that it stays attached because

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.940 
branch so that it stays attached because
there's<00:01:07.900> nothing<00:01:08.080> else<00:01:08.290> other<00:01:08.619> than<00:01:08.830> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.850 
like gravel and then if you just get
some<00:02:05.350> tree<00:02:06.130> branches<00:02:07.410> don't<00:02:08.410> decorate<00:02:08.560> it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
some tree branches don't decorate it

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.240 
some tree branches don't decorate it
like<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.390> with<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> little<00:02:11.019> practice<00:02:11.319> you
