00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
a strainer but you really should use a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460 
a strainer but you really should use a
strainer<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:49.450> you're<00:01:49.720> using<00:01:49.930> paint<00:01:50.259> that's

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
putting it on really thick at first and

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.219 
putting it on really thick at first and
I<00:06:07.819> you<00:06:07.969> know<00:06:08.089> the<00:06:08.240> first<00:06:08.449> coat<00:06:08.779> or<00:06:08.929> two<00:06:09.079> you

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
should be able to see through the paint

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.579 
should be able to see through the paint
and<00:06:11.509> that's<00:06:11.599> that's<00:06:12.019> what<00:06:12.259> this<00:06:12.409> was<00:06:12.559> like

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589 
and that's that's what this was like

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.489 
and that's that's what this was like
even<00:06:13.129> if<00:06:13.219> the<00:06:13.339> camera<00:06:13.550> doesn't<00:06:13.729> wanna<00:06:14.499> you

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:15.499 
even if the camera doesn't wanna you

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.549 
even if the camera doesn't wanna you
know<00:06:15.529> show<00:06:15.919> that<00:06:15.949> but<00:06:16.819> anyway<00:06:17.379> here's<00:06:18.379> the

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:18.559 
know show that but anyway here's the

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.679 
know show that but anyway here's the
finished<00:06:18.919> product<00:06:19.249> and<00:06:19.999> they<00:06:20.360> were<00:06:20.419> red

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689 
finished product and they were red

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.319 
finished product and they were red
before<00:06:20.979> but<00:06:21.979> she<00:06:22.159> used<00:06:22.309> really<00:06:22.519> crappy<00:06:23.059> paint

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:23.329 
before but she used really crappy paint

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:26.169 
before but she used really crappy paint
and<00:06:24.069> you<00:06:25.069> know<00:06:25.189> we<00:06:25.309> tried<00:06:25.519> to<00:06:25.639> get<00:06:25.759> it<00:06:25.849> all<00:06:25.969> off

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:26.179 
and you know we tried to get it all off

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:27.669 
and you know we tried to get it all off
and<00:06:26.389> apparently<00:06:26.809> we<00:06:26.959> miss<00:06:27.169> them<00:06:27.379> up<00:06:27.529> around

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:27.679 
and apparently we miss them up around

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:31.149 
and apparently we miss them up around
here<00:06:28.279> but<00:06:28.969> that's<00:06:29.119> what<00:06:29.360> that<00:06:29.539> is<00:06:29.809> and<00:06:30.709> I<00:06:31.099> think

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
here but that's what that is and I think

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.989 
here but that's what that is and I think
it<00:06:31.429> looks<00:06:31.610> great

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:31.999 
it looks great

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.079 
it looks great
so<00:06:32.839> she's<00:06:33.709> just<00:06:33.919> putting<00:06:34.099> out<00:06:34.279> the<00:06:34.429> fire<00:06:34.699> over
