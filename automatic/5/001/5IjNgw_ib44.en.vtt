00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
have used an ultimate team this year

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.040 
have used an ultimate team this year
easily<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> mean<00:02:19.890> he<00:02:20.519> actually<00:02:20.640> feels<00:02:21.150> quite<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
easily I mean he actually feels quite a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
car blah blah blah the players feel
different<00:02:34.200> depending<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.650> their<00:02:34.769> other<00:02:35.010> steps

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
different depending on their other steps

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
different depending on their other steps
so<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:36.120> guess<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:36.989> depends<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.680> play

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
so I guess it just depends on your play

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
so I guess it just depends on your play
style<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:38.489> he<00:02:38.580> feels<00:02:38.760> easily<00:02:39.629> fast<00:02:39.900> enough

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
style but he feels easily fast enough

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
style but he feels easily fast enough
for<00:02:40.319> me<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.950> she<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.340> such<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> clinical

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
except better in my opinion and he

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.849 
except better in my opinion and he
scored<00:04:18.209> one<00:04:18.419> really<00:04:18.930> crazy<00:04:19.229> long<00:04:19.530> shot<00:04:19.739> which

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
scored one really crazy long shot which

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.640 
scored one really crazy long shot which
has<00:04:20.010> like<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.489> load<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.030> curve<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:22.530> at

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.250 
has like a load of curve just right at
the<00:04:22.800> end<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.539> looked<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.599> it<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:24.840> going<00:04:24.990> wide

the end I looked like it was going wide
and<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.740> just<00:04:25.919> curved<00:04:26.160> right<00:04:26.820> back<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.270> into

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
and it just curved right back in into

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.890 
and it just curved right back in into
the<00:04:27.750> goals<00:04:28.099> so<00:04:29.099> he's<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.460> crazy<00:04:29.880> crazy<00:04:30.479> player

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
sort of part of the reason why I didn't

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.460 
sort of part of the reason why I didn't
give<00:04:42.719> him<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.930> ten

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470

although<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.920> bet<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.280> much<00:04:45.430> money<00:04:45.610> to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
although if you bet that much money to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.240 
although if you bet that much money to
be<00:04:46.360> throwing<00:04:46.690> around<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.380> guess<00:04:47.590> money<00:04:47.860> isn't

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
be throwing around I guess money isn't

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.280 
be throwing around I guess money isn't
that<00:04:48.520> much<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.940> an<00:04:49.030> object<00:04:49.360> for<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.690> because

clinical<00:05:00.100> finisher<00:05:00.520> I've<00:05:00.730> used<00:05:01.000> all<00:05:01.300> year

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
clinical finisher I've used all year

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.490 
clinical finisher I've used all year
better<00:05:02.890> than<00:05:03.070> far<00:05:03.430> fan<00:05:03.670> but<00:05:04.540> far<00:05:04.870> fan<00:05:05.080> costs

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500

about<00:05:05.620> 180<00:05:06.460> km<00:05:06.790> s<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.210> that's<00:05:07.450> why<00:05:07.630> he<00:05:08.290> gets<00:05:08.470> a

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
about 180 km s so that's why he gets a

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.770 
about 180 km s so that's why he gets a
higher<00:05:08.740> rating<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:10.150> if<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.330> have<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.600> cash
