00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.300
 Welcome to this video 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.769
 Here I'll go to two special ones 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.410
 Subscribers ask questions 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.180
 once how to clip several each other 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 can cut and how to clip once 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.900
 at two different speeds 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.099
 So, for example, it can be slow 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.050
 So normal slowly back to normal 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.779
 and that may have been asking the two 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.690
 to me as not yet the kokoro 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.100
 studio 2 came out so one is still 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.559
 take away the senses worked by the studio 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.559
 and there it was not 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.390
 that's why I'll do it now 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.969
 demonstrate briefly and that is the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.120
 whole with the year of birth the right one 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.270
 version is that it would be I I 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.140
 the downloadlink in the description as 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.949
 import the first time be 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 standard clips 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:10.460
 your part out here 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.460
 if that leaves no sap conversion 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.910
 though end say 2 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.539
 look now for mÃ¼nster motion 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:31.329
 want to have 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:33.479
 2 the third time here and he is at the park 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.479
 3 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.040
 For example, if I am different 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.950
 would want to pack from each other 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.310
 I just import my part 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.620
 cut out because convert here and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.170
 then I would jump too, like here 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.670
 Jobs not 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.429
 first club like our second part 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 in the third part or as ours 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.470
 different videos and that would be 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 first question answered how the to 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.819
 change there can add 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 then we have to export it then 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.239
 and make it to our club now 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:29.629
 We continue our unity 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:33.040
 So our state will lay on it 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.040
 me good quality 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.519
 kreft 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.870
 yes my pc is not quite under that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 his small performance characterizes this 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.690
 all later changed and all city we 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.660
 normalos 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.660
 I was just on the clips young on 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.030
 now we can already here times 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.660
 to practice 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 Video control here we will see already 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 we see the speed 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.660
 for example on that is I've percent 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.570
 the whole now 148 ps recorded so 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.600
 up to 75 percent on the thirties ps 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.190
 should run 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.850
 look pretty good 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:53.000
 you can already see here hopefully 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:58.620
 can see already running slow and 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.500
 I'll end this whole thing too now 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.970
 can really see if you are now 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.630
 nobody has any more videos 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.250
 For example, I took 60 20 42 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.870
 you can of course with the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.170
 speed even further down 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.090
 go 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.140
 I will now just be around the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.750
 demonstrate on show 50 fatalities 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.770
 it then slows down 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.340
 however , it will not be anymore afterwards 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:33.020
 look good and you could only 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:35.370
 I'm not stuck now 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.530
 exports the whole and project that us 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.420
 end of the video with it so synonymous times 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.230
 could see the whole thing in the end 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.230
 then looks 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.750
 yes I hope I could continue you 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.460
 explain these two questions well and on 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.330
 the other 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.330
 we have until the next
