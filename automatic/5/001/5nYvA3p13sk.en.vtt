00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330 
to match the track but one thing I
wanted<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> make<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.710> removable

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
wanted to do was to make it removable

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
wanted to do was to make it removable
from<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> car<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:17.359> have<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> shot<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
from the car so I can have it shot and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.510 
from the car so I can have it shot and
bring<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.380> back<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.710> ready<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> go<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.310> plug

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
bring it back all ready to go just plug

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.089 
bring it back all ready to go just plug
it<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:22.250> what<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.310> did<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.730> bought<00:00:27.980> some<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it in so what I did was I bought some of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.180 
it in so what I did was I bought some of
these<00:00:30.920> Parts<00:00:31.920> Express<00:00:32.130> comm<00:00:32.669> has<00:00:32.910> these<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.030 

best<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.379> strip<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> wires<00:00:40.739> back

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
best way to do it strip the wires back

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.920 
best way to do it strip the wires back
which<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.850> had<00:00:41.940> already<00:00:42.090> started<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.660> here

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.799 

they're<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.850> different<00:00:47.850> color<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.360> should

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they're all a different color so should

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.319 
they're all a different color so should
be<00:00:48.840> pretty<00:00:49.079> easy<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.559> without<00:00:49.890> messing<00:00:50.100> up

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
be pretty easy to do without messing up

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.819 
be pretty easy to do without messing up
all<00:00:51.329> right<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.719> thing's<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> car

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.939 

alright<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.960> there's<00:01:00.960> only<00:01:01.079> nine<00:01:01.320> wires<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
alright so there's only nine wires so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
alright so there's only nine wires so
I've<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> ninth<00:01:02.430> circuit<00:01:02.910> connector<00:01:03.660> molex

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I've got a ninth circuit connector molex

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.550 
I've got a ninth circuit connector molex
plug<00:01:04.909> each<00:01:05.909> wire<00:01:06.270> they'll<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.020> eighteen<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
plug each wire they'll be eighteen of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.010 
plug each wire they'll be eighteen of
them<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:09.409> attached<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> pin<00:01:11.780> I'm<00:01:12.780> gonna

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
them will be attached to a pin I'm gonna

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
them will be attached to a pin I'm gonna
solve<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.350> room<00:01:13.530> even<00:01:13.950> though<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> could

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
solve it room even though you could

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.560 
solve it room even though you could
probably<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.909> away<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.150> crimping<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
probably just get away with crimping it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.060 
probably just get away with crimping it
but<00:01:15.750> i'll<00:01:15.869> solder<00:01:16.080> each<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.680> once

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
but i'll solder each one of these once

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.940 
but i'll solder each one of these once
each<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> soldered<00:01:18.770> I'll<00:01:19.770> go

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
each one of these is soldered I'll go

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.080 
each one of these is soldered I'll go
ahead<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> pop<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.549> into<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.909> little

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ahead and pop it right into this little

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
ahead and pop it right into this little
plug<00:01:21.470> it's<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> little<00:01:22.860> one-way<00:01:23.250> spying<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
plug it's got a little one-way spying on

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
plug it's got a little one-way spying on
it<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.619> it'll<00:01:25.619> lock<00:01:25.799> itself<00:01:26.100> into

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it as you can see it'll lock itself into

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
it as you can see it'll lock itself into
place<00:01:26.479> do<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> male<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> female

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
place do that on the male and female

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
place do that on the male and female
side<00:01:28.829> it'll<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.250> good<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> go<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:31.380> course<00:01:31.470> I'm

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
side it'll be good to go of course I'm

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
side it'll be good to go of course I'm
going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.210> grab<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:33.329> favorite<00:01:33.689> tool<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
going to grab my favorite tool in the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.860 
going to grab my favorite tool in the
world

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.090 

separate<00:01:44.870> these<00:01:45.050> up<00:01:45.290> make<00:01:45.500> them<00:01:45.620> easy<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:45.950> get

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
separate these up make them easy to get

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.830 
separate these up make them easy to get
to<00:01:50.230> just<00:01:51.230> like<00:01:51.410> that<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.500> what<00:01:54.650> I'll<00:01:54.770> do<00:01:55.840> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to just like that so what I'll do is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:15.190 
to just like that so what I'll do is
obviously<00:01:56.990> crimp<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.860> there

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.120 

every<00:02:16.200> single<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.650> those<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.010> all

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
every single one of those is all

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.370 
every single one of those is all
soldered<00:02:17.520> up<00:02:17.840> now<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.960> time<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> put<00:02:19.320> them

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
soldered up now it's time to put them

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.580 
soldered up now it's time to put them
together<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.090> plug<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.380> be<00:02:22.560> done

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
together and a plug for them and be done

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:49.380 
together and a plug for them and be done
with<00:02:22.770> it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390
