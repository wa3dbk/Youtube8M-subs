 or the part of the program that jÃ´ 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:37.209
 placed as trike and unc 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.270
 after this is done you will give a 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.570
 space after these dash gives 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.410
 space typing this one that I forgot 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.440

 done that you want to do 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.850
 you will see in what to perform as 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.320
 administrator in windows 8 worked 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.019
 said 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.790
 this works for both 32 bit 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.430
 both windows 7 both 64 santo and xp 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.760
 It works in general, there you go. 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.280
 To do this, here goes. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.250
 says paghi to invent if a 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.930
 Ripple taking advantage of cab here I'm 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.959
 thinking that it is bought very slowly and 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.580
 or give an improved overall thereof and 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.820
 It takes time but it has to have a bit of 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.820
 Patience goes who said to be 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.820
 properties 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.980
 is really optimization tools 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.140
 if you fragment the unit will be the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 optimization whenever you wanted and 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.200
 if the team will do 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.950
 like this every time some program 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.310
 it is being spread the ellipse father to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.730
 spain in chpa this defragmentation 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.740
 she will join you all there when she 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.580
 It does not stop made already all 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.260
 spread 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.870
 the content has more work to get where 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.180
 the file is even defragmented 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.250
 no company knows the right place is already 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.980
 everything in fifth everything on foot 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.620
 This will help you out if you have 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.600
 patience at home and use delay 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.600
 Quite a lot but if you have too much trouble 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.050
 I use content paulo in exchange I go 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.230
 having to do this here will depend 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.600
 very acceptable using it will 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.770
 It takes so that's what I say will 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.880
 be more or less 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:50.330
 there you done it wait will follow 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.530
 alone and will work in a good 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.020
 I'm just going to do what I 'm not 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.710
 conformed installed to show you 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.680
 how does the result here cyclic 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.230
 used is that you had said local 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.720
 in having their programs to use 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.660
 because with this soft cover step 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.420
 Internet 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.420
 today quite shady 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:22.349
