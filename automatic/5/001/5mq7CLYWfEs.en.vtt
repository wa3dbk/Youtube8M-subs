00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.630
 yo everyone knows shoulders knows himself 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.679
 new episode of the series we activate 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 on the jobsite if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.839
 it's also under 7th and today I 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 introduce you to a village rush this village 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.420
 works really well I'm going to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.820
 just show right at the end when 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 I will have finished 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.990
 it's a village that I write with a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.370
 buddy actually completely to the bowl on 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.770
 told himself at the base and if we made a 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.970
 heart to laugh like that at best and 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.560
 in fact it works very very very well 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.870
 you 'll see on some stuff that 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.810
 the traps in this village are really 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 useful actually they go they go cards 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.489
 and knows how to explain if you do not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.350
 not these traps and well and well it's 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.930
 almost fucking I want to say because this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 village and is riddled with traps 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.780
 that is to say that you will win 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.000
 defenses through these traps almost 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's really pretty frankly I 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 you will see that I have already won five 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.560
 or six defense in a row like that and the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.420
 blow it's really fun I can I 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.159
 went past the people their 3 it was 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.140
 really fast since yesterday I bought 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 I'm already in gold 3 while I was 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.810
 a margin in two I hope I'm going 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 to be able to go crystal I will not do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.450
 a series in pro race to share if 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.520
 you if you ask me 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 but I think there are already a lot 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 on youtube and his 1/2 to do like the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 others so I did not show the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.659
 village at first because I 'm going galley to the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.689
 to do each time I spend ten minutes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.080
 on it so we already see the base of the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.869
 town 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.600
 and then and then where it gets 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.470
 interesting is the step I take 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.580
 do not deceive yes that's it then that's it 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.700
 then there are our two towers of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.100
 wizards actually this village we have 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.900
 noticed with always the same post that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.659
 you will soon you are not known 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.659
 I do not tell you more 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.970
 this village we marked excuse me 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.709
 I wish a little anyhow 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 we noticed that it's not 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.020
 possible 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.800
 to find a village on which we 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.570
 can avoid the 50% minimum I actually 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.580
 think supercell worked like that 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.620
 It is not possible 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.350
 for example take a scarf at the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.420
 scarf in which is basic even with 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.150
 scarf at home come to do 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.370
 50% on any village 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.130
 after six o'clock if you attack in 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.650
 champion it'll be a little harder but 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.030
 do not wait that I'm wrong so here 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.120
 we already see the pieces they have a little 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.680
 present everywhere already springs have 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.240
 maybe tell me giant members but 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.270
 no we are not going to do it there you 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.230
 will see where I will therefore place there 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.140
 in place our huts we already remember 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.730
 the man to the initial form of our from 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.140
 our village so what are we 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.200
 rock salt for those who do not know 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.550
 the rush is actually the goal is going to be 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.050
 to have the most trophies to have the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.739
 more trophies to say anything else 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.080
 frankly on it is a bit of everything 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's fine this expression is so our 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.500
 giant bombs we will go beyond the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.120
 career is always that they are going 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.850
 try to access directly to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.060
 tanks and after that we have this is 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.550
 little boom that hurt 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.459
 so I already had you I already have you 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.810
 says in my video barbaric king discovery 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.250
 who is heard claude and so 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.519
 I link the videos there I really 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.950
 want that I changed vatos clan 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.390
 locos very good plans the genres are there 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.270
 very nice 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.470
 I was in this camp for rock because it 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.090
 are some of the biggest hit I have 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.400
 the best troops but the guys 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.650
 are really cool so so am I 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.330
 happy this past clan if you want I 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.840
 believe that there is a minimum darche and I 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.910
 do not know how much 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.950
 finally it depends on there is not really any 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.760
 restriction to parquet must be active 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.090
 and all that will go watch a vatos 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.300
 locos three small dots so here you go 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.970
 that's all for my little clan in fact 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.109
 the 50% must be minimized by putting 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.760
 to explain them by putting the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.560
 exterior buildings closest to 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.120
 tours darche and so for example if you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.840
 put a market this ode to that will have 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.330
 this gun when in paris for there I go 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.630
 put my mines 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.340
 you will actually see this village 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.260
 is very very thoughtful without wanting 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.490
 brag about myself 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.860
 frankly I advise you here 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.940
 above all because because he 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.140
 is really good so the device 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.000
 the archers we can not reach 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.950
 these two things the only problem is 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.270
 this and to castle clan so it takes 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.580
 constantly having troops 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.340
 he is not at best but I prefer 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.340
 but you the king of the barbarians in the middle 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.720
 in fact no I'm going to do that and then and 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.800
 then here is the castle 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.040
 wind is really all over the village 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.500
 what is hard is to have the 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.450
 black elections tank protect but 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.650
 good there I have not many I do not 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.650
 not so I do not care a bit 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:24.229
 two seconds so we see that these 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.310
 traps are very useful why because 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.800
 that in fact the giants they go 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.440
 automatically go there to go 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.440
 break those mortars and his giants if they 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.289
 are you all going with 2.2 spring 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.270
 to eliminate 6 and the seat so if either 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:43.669
 2 it's been twelve if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.650
 finally I hope I do not find myself so 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.240
 I told you that's all there is 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.010
 protected apart unfortunately this 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.770
 elections tank similar place 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.400
 for these two barracks at this barracks 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.450
 same for this barracks so we see 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.100
 that the reindeer antilles are really 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.320
 not badly protected 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.500
 that's the goal I wanted her to be 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.870
 really well protected and the same for 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.310
 ex ex trader because the 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.980
 problem with the archers is that you 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.840
 can the company pack you in c1 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.550
 you will be able to destroy this elixir 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.200
 black this elixir north so this is what 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.270
 village for me is really really 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.130
 very well I advise you it's done 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.490
 that two days a day that I light it 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.430
 won 66 defense trophy 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.350
 frankly it's really not bad me 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.490
 I do not ask for more 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.820
 when I saw that I was really 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.890
 really happy and so we find 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.800
 there unfortunately if we have a 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.570
 archilla omd trucks lab but not 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.040
 these two barracks 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.420
 so we're going to add our camps now 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.730
 camps that are more cumbersome 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.490
 it's just embarrassing I want to say 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.130
 because you see to have there I do not 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.200
 do not know so wide and can destroy 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:03.250
 easily its so the device up 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.250
 the same for that ben I fucked perfect 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:11.000
 So here we are going to place our camps 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.650
 I hope to play here is what is 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.470
 practice is that I do not know if we 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:19.700
 can place our troops already there I do not 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:23.060
 think not and our anti air there at 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.860
 middle hop that's all for this 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.810
 small village 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.880
 I recommend a rock village hdv 7 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.960
 and jallet backup because it's my 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.220
 initial village so just for you 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.910
 talk about the little defense as we 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.800
 see I started this village there 19 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.750
 hours ago at 19:30 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.460
 I won my problems and we do that 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.180
 chained chesnais not really I you 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.410
 advise him well listen to friends 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.260
 that's all for this video I hope that 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:54.590
 I hope you have made me turn my page 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.620
 because we are soon 11 cents subscribers and 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.120
 the video 100 subscribers is going to be just 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.220
 monstrous so did his tour if you 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.570
 want to see it as soon as possible and then 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.570
 is saying ah the next to all
