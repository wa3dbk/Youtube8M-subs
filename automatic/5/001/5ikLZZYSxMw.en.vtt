00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
now been introduced to call duty I think

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
now been introduced to call duty I think
I<00:01:07.710> mentioned<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> previous<00:01:08.580> loadout

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
I mentioned this in the previous loadout

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.550 
I mentioned this in the previous loadout
but<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.659> been<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.110> cool<00:01:10.320> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
but it would have been really cool if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
but it would have been really cool if
you<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.710> these<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:11.189> available<00:01:11.460> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you had these things available in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
you had these things available in
battlefield<00:01:12.330> 3<00:01:12.420> I've<00:01:13.140> never<00:01:13.409> personally<00:01:13.650> been

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a big fan of that as longer range optics

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
a big fan of that as longer range optics
like<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> ACOG<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.920> more

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like the ACOG because of that more

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
like the ACOG because of that more
pronounced<00:01:17.610> recoil<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.210> battlefield<00:01:18.630> having

actually<00:04:17.040> works<00:04:17.489> pretty<00:04:17.760> well<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> AUG

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720

and<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> best<00:04:19.829> strategy<00:04:20.340> was<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
and the best strategy was to

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.670 
and the best strategy was to
continuously<00:04:21.180> switch<00:04:21.390> between<00:04:21.690> semi-auto<00:04:22.530> or

so<00:04:25.639> long<00:04:25.850> range<00:04:26.090> engagements<00:04:26.680> because<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
so long range engagements because of the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.350 
so long range engagements because of the
bullpup<00:04:28.190> design<00:04:28.250> you'd<00:04:28.759> actually<00:04:28.910> get<00:04:29.210> that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
bullpup design you'd actually get that

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.210 
bullpup design you'd actually get that
tighter<00:04:29.690> hipfire<00:04:29.960> spread<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.740> battlefield<00:04:31.160> 3

tighter hipfire spread in battlefield 3

so this kind of alleviates some of the

so this kind of alleviates some of the

is<00:04:42.259> not<00:04:42.380> too<00:04:42.500> bad<00:04:42.710> for<00:04:42.860> long<00:04:42.979> range

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
is not too bad for long range
