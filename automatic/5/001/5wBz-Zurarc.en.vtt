almost been two years since its debut

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
almost been two years since its debut
and<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:35.120> before<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.270> started<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and here they are before I get started I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.940 
and here they are before I get started I
like<00:00:36.840> pouring<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> thief<00:00:37.500> shoes<00:00:37.739> or

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
like pouring out the thief shoes or

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.420 
like pouring out the thief shoes or
trash<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.790> point<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.809> restored<00:00:40.260> them

so that's why they look a little

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.470 
so that's why they look a little
discolored<00:00:43.820> compared<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> newer<00:00:45.210> ones<00:00:47.480> so
