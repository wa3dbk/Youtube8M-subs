 special to luciano rob you that we 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 at home or in a gym to reduce 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.609
 fat of this part of the body 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.499
 to start you could start to modify 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.329
 your diet in the night when you go to 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.879
 lie down try not to consume 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.199
 carbohydrates which is what you could 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.230
 start to generate a little bit of tissue 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.359
 I adipose this in general in your body 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.450
 nothing more in the pectoral but out there 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 good ingredients but it makes me very 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 dry you can not add yogurt or 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.929

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.259
 you can add milk light or you can 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.689
 boil the milk to remove the cream 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.850
 this to avoid consuming the calories 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.009
 of fat you can also add 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.799
 yogurt of natural preference to avoid 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.719

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.590
 look no longer the difference to make 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.570
 definition or muscle mass is going to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.960
 consist of both the weight you use 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.030

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560
 check the nutrition videos so that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.630
 complement the routines of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.090
 training with more weight you put 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.310
 You can generate more volume 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.230
 as long as you carry the diet 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.500
 adequate to generate that muscle mass 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.190
 if you do more repetitions with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.230
 little weight and with rest periods more 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.760
