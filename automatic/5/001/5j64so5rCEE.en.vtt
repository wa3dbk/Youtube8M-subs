00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
think it's the easiest actually let's go
for<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.989> let's<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> health<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
for the let's go for the health and the

for the let's go for the health and the
knee<00:00:59.280> invisibility<00:00:59.870> now<00:01:00.870> cuz<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.109> do

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
knee invisibility now cuz if you do

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
knee invisibility now cuz if you do
think<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> bit<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.539> those

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
think this a bit or if you do the those

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.700 
think this a bit or if you do the those
glitches<00:01:03.719> first<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
glitches first and then you do the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
glitches first and then you do the
invisibility<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.519> cancels<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
invisibility it just cancels them out so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.800 
invisibility it just cancels them out so
okay<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
okay go for it then so what you do for

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
okay go for it then so what you do for
the<00:01:10.049> visibility<00:01:10.890> glitch<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> throw

like<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.429> just<00:01:59.460> keep<00:01:59.789> swinging<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.600> don't

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
like you can just keep swinging I don't

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
like you can just keep swinging I don't
know<00:02:01.050> if<00:02:01.110> there's<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.319> limit<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.069> I'm

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
know if there's a limit on it but I'm

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.730 
know if there's a limit on it but I'm
pretty<00:02:03.270> sure<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.720> because<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.500> doesn't

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
pretty sure there is because it doesn't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
pretty sure there is because it doesn't
seem<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.069> goes<00:02:05.220> fast<00:02:05.700> after<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.149> while<00:02:06.330> but

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
seem like it goes fast after a while but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
seem like it goes fast after a while but
you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.100> keep<00:02:08.220> swinging<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.970> you'll

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you can just keep swinging and you'll

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
you can just keep swinging and you'll
just<00:02:09.660> eventually<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.259> faster<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.400> anyway

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
just eventually go faster but anyway

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.140 
just eventually go faster but anyway
