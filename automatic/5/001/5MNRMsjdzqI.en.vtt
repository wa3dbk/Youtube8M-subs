give you an elapsed time and that's a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.629 
give you an elapsed time and that's a
rolling<00:04:31.229> number<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.740> it'll<00:04:31.889> go<00:04:32.009> four<00:04:32.310> minutes

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
rolling number so it'll go four minutes

five minutes ten minutes that eventually

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.409 
five minutes ten minutes that eventually
we'll<00:04:34.380> get<00:04:34.500> up<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.580> right<00:04:35.759> time<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.240> count

we'll get up to the right time and count

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.920 
we'll get up to the right time and count
back<00:04:36.690> down<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.740> could<00:04:37.889> expect<00:04:38.660> again<00:04:39.660> about

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
back down you could expect again about

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.689 
back down you could expect again about
thirty<00:04:40.350> minutes<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.800> an<00:04:40.949> hour<00:04:41.130> depending<00:04:41.490> on

the size of the drive that's being

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.540 
the size of the drive that's being
restored<00:04:44.690> through<00:04:45.690> camera<00:04:46.199> magic<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.770> will

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
restored through camera magic I will

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.020 
restored through camera magic I will
complete<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.590> five<00:04:49.590> minutes<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.220> we're

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
complete this five minutes and we're

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.969 
complete this five minutes and we're
done<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:51.870> now<00:04:52.020> what<00:04:52.199> we're<00:04:52.350> going<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.500> do<00:04:52.680> is

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
done so now what we're going to do is

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.520 
done so now what we're going to do is
we're<00:04:53.220> going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.400> verify<00:04:53.880> before<00:04:54.360> we<00:04:54.630> remove

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
we're going to verify before we remove

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.260 
we're going to verify before we remove
the<00:04:55.680> drive<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.160> finish<00:04:56.460> up<00:04:56.669> this<00:04:56.849> restore

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
the drive and finish up this restore

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.850 
the drive and finish up this restore
we're<00:04:57.780> going<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.960> verify<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.349> everything<00:04:58.500> is

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
we're going to verify that everything is

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.800 
we're going to verify that everything is
done<00:04:58.979> correctly<00:04:59.150> you<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.300> see<00:05:00.509> that<00:05:00.660> you

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
done correctly you can see that you

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.439 
done correctly you can see that you
should<00:05:01.050> have<00:05:01.289> a<00:05:01.530> system<00:05:01.770> reserved<00:05:02.280> file<00:05:02.639> and

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
should have a system reserved file and

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.450 
should have a system reserved file and
you<00:05:03.840> should<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.530> new<00:05:04.710> volume<00:05:04.919> file<00:05:05.280> these

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
you should have a new volume file these

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.879 
you should have a new volume file these
again<00:05:05.729> are<00:05:05.759> both<00:05:06.000> partitioned<00:05:06.720> out<00:05:06.900> what<00:05:07.860> I

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
again are both partitioned out what I

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.060 
again are both partitioned out what I
will<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.220> is<00:05:08.400> I<00:05:08.520> will<00:05:08.550> go<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:09.919> right<00:05:10.919> mouse

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
will do is I will go to right mouse

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.790 
will do is I will go to right mouse
click<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.490> computer<00:05:12.030> go<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.780> disk<00:05:13.349> management

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
click on computer go to disk management

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.219 
click on computer go to disk management
and<00:05:14.130> then<00:05:14.729> what<00:05:14.910> I'll<00:05:15.030> do<00:05:15.210> is<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.570> will<00:05:15.599> verify

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
and then what I'll do is I will verify

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.589 
and then what I'll do is I will verify
that<00:05:16.530> everything<00:05:16.830> has<00:05:17.580> been<00:05:17.849> copied<00:05:18.449> over

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
that everything has been copied over

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:30.410 
that everything has been copied over
correctly<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:19.349> let's<00:05:19.530> do<00:05:19.710> that<00:05:19.860> right<00:05:20.039> now

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.690 

you<00:05:30.810> can<00:05:30.960> see<00:05:31.110> if<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.290> scroll<00:05:31.560> down<00:05:31.620> my<00:05:32.160> disk<00:05:32.430> to

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
you can see if I scroll down my disk to

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.640 
you can see if I scroll down my disk to
now<00:05:32.880> has<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.180> system<00:05:33.570> reserved<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.440> has

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
now has the system reserved and it has

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.620 
now has the system reserved and it has
the<00:05:34.860> primary<00:05:35.280> partition<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.120> it's<00:05:36.330> all<00:05:36.450> set

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
the primary partition and it's all set

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.560 
the primary partition and it's all set
up<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:38.280> now<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.490> I'm<00:05:38.700> done<00:05:38.910> I'll<00:05:39.270> close

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
up so now that I'm done I'll close

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.880 
up so now that I'm done I'll close
everything<00:05:40.080> out<00:05:40.230> I'll<00:05:40.440> verify<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
everything out I'll verify the

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.950 
everything out I'll verify the
information<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.760> I'm<00:05:42.150> now<00:05:42.330> ready<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.660> remove
