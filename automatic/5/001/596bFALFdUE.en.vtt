00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
what I decided to do about four months

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.390 
what I decided to do about four months
ago<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:05.180> take<00:01:06.180> doctor's<00:01:07.049> advice<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.689> get<00:01:09.689> up

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
ago was take doctor's advice and get up

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.359 
ago was take doctor's advice and get up
try<00:01:11.400> doing<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.939> exercise<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.040> hard

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
try doing some exercise and it is hard

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
try doing some exercise and it is hard
because<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.960> most<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:17.750> most<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
because as most of you know most of the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.350 
because as most of you know most of the
time<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> pain<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
time you're in a lot of pain and it's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
time you're in a lot of pain and it's
kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.840> systematic<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:23.100> pain

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
kind of systematic it's all over pain

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
kind of systematic it's all over pain
and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> can't<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.150> always<00:01:24.689> fight

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and you can't really always fight

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.569 
and you can't really always fight
through<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:28.470> day<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.369> decided

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
through that but one day I just decided

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.050 
through that but one day I just decided
I<00:01:30.060> had<00:01:30.090> enough<00:01:30.509> being<00:01:30.869> stuck<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> bed<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I had enough being stuck in bed and I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.160 
I had enough being stuck in bed and I
was<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.420> something<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
was going to do something about it so I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.730 
was going to do something about it so I
decided<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.500> wanted<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> try<00:01:38.520> running<00:01:39.740> nothing

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
decided I wanted to try running nothing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560 
decided I wanted to try running nothing
bigger<00:01:41.369> than<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.880> decided<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.450> was

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
bigger than that I just decided I was

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
bigger than that I just decided I was
going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> try<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:45.079> was<00:01:46.079> 40<00:01:46.920> pounds
