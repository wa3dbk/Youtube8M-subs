00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
series of games he's probably gonna

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.610

other<00:04:51.220> types<00:04:51.490> of<00:04:51.640> units<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:54.390> am<00:04:55.390> personally

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
other types of units so I am personally

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.530 
other types of units so I am personally
I'm<00:04:56.320> think<00:04:56.770> I'm<00:04:56.800> hoping<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.880> stork<00:04:58.270> will<00:04:58.420> win

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
I'm think I'm hoping that stork will win

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.150 
I'm think I'm hoping that stork will win
this<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.840> think<00:04:58.900> he<00:04:59.260> will<00:04:59.410> win<00:04:59.440> this

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
this I think he will win this

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.890 
this I think he will win this
I<00:05:00.220> think<00:05:00.760> fantasy<00:05:01.150> will<00:05:01.300> put<00:05:01.450> up<00:05:01.570> more<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.780> a

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
I think fantasy will put up more of a

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.780 
I think fantasy will put up more of a
fight<00:05:01.930> than<00:05:02.260> people<00:05:02.590> have<00:05:02.680> been<00:05:02.860> saying<00:05:03.190> he

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
fight than people have been saying he

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.420 
fight than people have been saying he
will<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:05.140> think<00:05:05.290> Stewart<00:05:05.920> will<00:05:06.100> come<00:05:06.280> out

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
will but I think Stewart will come out

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.360 
will but I think Stewart will come out
of<00:05:06.550> this<00:05:06.640> maybe<00:05:06.970> three<00:05:07.600> one<00:05:08.040> three<00:05:09.040> two<00:05:09.220> one

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
of this maybe three one three two one

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.170 
of this maybe three one three two one
three<00:05:09.580> wins<00:05:09.880> one<00:05:10.240> loss<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.720> fantasy<00:05:11.170> we'll<00:05:11.740> see

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.600 
thinking about doing some cheese this is
I<00:06:02.110> wouldn't<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.590> expected<00:06:02.800> this<00:06:03.130> from<00:06:03.190> him<00:06:03.490> I

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
I wouldn't have expected this from him I

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.610 
I wouldn't have expected this from him I
would<00:06:04.210> have<00:06:04.300> expected<00:06:04.750> him<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.930> go<00:06:05.020> standard

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
would have expected him to go standard

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.740 
would have expected him to go standard
gameplay<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.390> because<00:06:07.390> I<00:06:07.450> think<00:06:07.480> his

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
gameplay and because I think his

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.120 
gameplay and because I think his
standard<00:06:08.140> gameplay<00:06:08.320> is<00:06:08.530> probably<00:06:08.919> better

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
standard gameplay is probably better

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.190 
standard gameplay is probably better
than<00:06:09.280> fantasies<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.120> we'll<00:06:10.570> see<00:06:10.750> what<00:06:11.080> he

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
than fantasies and we'll see what he

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.040 
than fantasies and we'll see what he
does<00:06:11.410> with<00:06:11.650> this<00:06:11.770> probe<00:06:12.480> if<00:06:13.480> he's<00:06:13.690> gonna<00:06:13.870> go

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
does with this probe if he's gonna go

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.840 
does with this probe if he's gonna go
for<00:06:14.230> some<00:06:14.410> kind<00:06:14.590> of<00:06:14.650> proxy<00:06:15.040> to<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.280> left<00:06:15.550> side

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
for some kind of proxy to the left side

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.700 
for some kind of proxy to the left side
of<00:06:16.150> fantasy<00:06:16.930> space<00:06:17.140> I<00:06:17.290> think<00:06:17.350> that's<00:06:17.590> what

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
of fantasy space I think that's what

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.590 
of fantasy space I think that's what
he's<00:06:17.830> going<00:06:18.010> for<00:06:18.100> here<00:06:18.520> he's<00:06:19.150> probably<00:06:19.360> going

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
he's going for here he's probably going

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.970 
he's going for here he's probably going
to<00:06:19.660> God<00:06:19.780> you<00:06:20.140> have<00:06:20.260> to<00:06:20.320> go<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.470> little<00:06:20.710> further

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
to God you have to go a little further

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.970 
to God you have to go a little further
out<00:06:21.280> you<00:06:21.460> have<00:06:21.640> very<00:06:22.350> great<00:06:23.350> hiding<00:06:23.770> place

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
out you have very great hiding place

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.490 
out you have very great hiding place
there<00:06:24.360> people<00:06:25.360> when<00:06:25.540> they<00:06:25.690> Scout<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.290> site
