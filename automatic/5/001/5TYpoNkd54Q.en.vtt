00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
I started to play drum drums very young

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.380 
I started to play drum drums very young
and<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> did<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> beginning<00:02:13.940> was<00:02:14.330> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and what I did in the beginning was to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.370 
and what I did in the beginning was to
listen<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.800> lot<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.130> music<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.319> try<00:02:18.319> to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
listen to a lot of music and try to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.550 
listen to a lot of music and try to
really<00:02:18.709> hear<00:02:18.980> what<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.640> he<00:02:20.120> doing<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.410> maybe

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
really hear what is he doing and maybe

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.809 
really hear what is he doing and maybe
you<00:02:21.650> shouldn't<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.160> start<00:02:22.550> with<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.530> most

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
you shouldn't really start with the most

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.920 
you shouldn't really start with the most
hard<00:02:25.819> stuff<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.180> play<00:02:26.390> maybe<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.750> should

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
hard stuff to play maybe you should

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.250 
hard stuff to play maybe you should
choose<00:02:27.379> something<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:28.040> kind<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:28.970> easy<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
choose something that is kind of easy so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
choose something that is kind of easy so
you<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:30.770> hear<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.220> he<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.430> doing<00:02:31.459> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
you can really hear what he is doing and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.690 
you can really hear what he is doing and
then<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.780> were<00:02:33.050> just<00:02:33.260> listening<00:02:33.640> trying<00:02:34.640> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
then I were just listening trying to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.770 
then I were just listening trying to
figure<00:02:34.879> out<00:02:34.910> what<00:02:35.120> he<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.270> doing<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.599> then<00:02:35.750> I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
figure out what he is doing and then I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.080 
figure out what he is doing and then I
were<00:02:35.959> trying<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.349> try<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.709> play<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.099> myself<00:02:37.520> and
