00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.880
 I'm a man you realize the two are 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.830
 again 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.540
 I thought I 'll do it again 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.869
 a shot behind the washing machine 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.590
 afterwards and hello minecraft follow 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.539
 I almost forgot that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.939
 you see what I take here yet 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.280
 I've had that before 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.620
 The ship was shown to the farmer 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.540
 today and what are you doing that is there 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
 I hope that this is for courage 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.390
 that minecraft will do that for one september 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.280
 by the way, there is still something going on in the front 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.409
 front teeth is still on it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.909
 I want to build that for the 13th 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.670
 and yes you see I already have here 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.159
 Some warehouse items are built and crates 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.549
 I have a rest and so on down here 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.600
 then partially expanded 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.979
 there are still some things I want here 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.340
 In between, I want this team 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.780
 make copies and then then back 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.219
 how should you call that the fair? 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.969
 Reform should be the fair back and forth 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:23.899
 the ship's kitchen should be on its own because 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.859
 between 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.420
 you try to explain something to her so here 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.149
 I then to final disposal towards them 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.429
 make people find work because of that 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.020
 is so funny you do you do 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.850
 you go to the level you have to get down to it 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.249
 put on top and then it is 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.710
 in the time but that is and here yes 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.140
 Well, here we have something I have 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.579
 already seen on ships I know 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.609
 not if that is correct at this point 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.810
 is built or if that continues after 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.369
 back to front to top to bottom 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 I do not know I have it there 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.179
 Done to other direction I found 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.679
 then you have to and as I said 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.549
 have the hope that the stay for 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:07.069
 september is used and then I am 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.030
 next to the other architects 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.560
 help here on 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.630
 that's why it takes me 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 So always talk to washing machine 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.340
 my best houses always a little longer 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.060
 lately if body at that time 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.220
 directly to your project already had there 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.220
 I'll be fine with that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.940
 Do I or myself do you have me ? 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.940
 the chat 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.410
 why did you tracked someone wrong 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.340
 not really but well so now 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.890
 so we have then tuned here yet 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.130
 still uses the yamaha moment that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.740
 just on snow 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.270
 around 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.980
 and here is the torch in the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.800
 air because a little bit still evaluates 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.320
 played because you used small trick 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.750
 I want to help anyway 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.550
 here at the head a little bit 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.900
 I still helped to redesign it 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.550
 the back is then there too 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.870
 again as I said then I have here 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.840
 helped again 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.790
 yes these are still several other projects 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 which I help with that is everything 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.340
 maps give this in the future on the force 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.680
 so i will not know where she is yet 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.590
 but they are used everywhere 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.330
 she will definitely give it everywhere and me 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.660
 I'm currently there, I want to go too 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.140
 just in porton / now I have the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.140
 chat but to 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.319
 moment the source rest we'll say 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.330
 out even once a 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.489
 I then build a building 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.980
 western city that will, however, there 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.690
 in the back it will continue and also 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.209
 this direction is going to be a thunderstorm here 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.520
 made on today, listen to where on 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.370
 small defect or not so opinion 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.569
 So the semester instead 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.130
 this is definitely going to be a lot 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.709
 continue to be built that should keep 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.330
 Give a little bigger westernstadt and me 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.200
 hope that will be on momo force 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.170
 be used 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.880

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.180
 currently take longer 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.889
 I hope you like it all the way 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.340
 I'll say until next time if yes 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.000
