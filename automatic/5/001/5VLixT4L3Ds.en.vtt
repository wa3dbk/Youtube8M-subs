00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
 the people today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.990
 if you need a cuticle plier 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 to start you get the pliers testing 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 to check if he has no game 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.270
 If he does not have a game, fine, you already 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 can start a spinning if he has game 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.050
 You have to put a function here. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.800
 in this position and hit the hammer until it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.899
 he gets adjusted do not play 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 okay 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:41.670
 starting the spinning I picked up and be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 apply and comb the sides to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.270
 that you have the notion of what a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.829
 charity association 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 when you're already practical you do not need 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.559
 do this job of painting 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.559
 Where are you going to cut it? 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 come on, lean on a corner of the same good 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:13.439
 supported handle file begins its work 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:19.380
 following the existing cut 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.170
 this cut it has to go equal to the margin 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 when the mother can not go deeper 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.840
 very far from the inside and not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 from the outside has to get along 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 here more or less you will have a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.250
 idea where it is white and where it states 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 a certain'll do it on the other side 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 of the problem 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 You take the cut to the end. 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.030
 Come on, it's finally over. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.159
 I showed before but I'll show now. 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.710
 this pliers here was blunt not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.159
 I know if he's already got the cut, but here it is. 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.079
 a piece of paper and he pulled and water 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.070
 is still 50 and is still ripping the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:09.929
 fact that has been placed beyond the 3rd there 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.590
 dry him he cuts more pulls very 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.860
 strong 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.709
 then it means and this guarantees you 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 not well sharp 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.890
 he is badly sharp 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.230
 let's finish the spinning to see how 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.200
 stay 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:36.450
 finished this nothing so you will look 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.629
 against light if there are no faults 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.099
 there can be no failure when he 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.180
 together it has to close perfectly 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.010
 both sides 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.250
 it has to close perfectly for 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.730
 have a cut in beautiful well done 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.569
 I found this side now you to this 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 other side here but there in the same process 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.140
 the uncle said 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.750
 I've been going for years until I get to the point. 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.209
 from bode here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.920
 checked is closed not closing 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:19.000
 well doing the white part down there 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.760
 it looks like it closes everything 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.430
 well after that you can match the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.709
 top for those who stop here both 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:37.049
 equal wheels comes on the side does the same 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.900
 process you see here is painted 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.639
 for you to have a margin of obama 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.940
 is working the file 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:50.069
 I will come accompanied active 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.500
 I know if I should order more right 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.389
 count left 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.609
 see now it's coming in the cut 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.620
 and look there saw 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.160
 I do not know if you'll see perfectly. 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.000
 this song had a little more chaotic 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.000
 I'll finish 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.599
 arriving on top and finishing the work 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:21.669
 and will make the other side of the pliers 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:23.940
 miranda and does same process has arrived in 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.470
 top old well 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.380
 we look 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.410
 how do you see the cut show perfectly 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.270
 I did not see the bottom of the image of the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.490
 paper 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:44.080
 Let's finish the part on 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:46.600
 up doing the work gets there 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.310
 closing normal we do this 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.000
 work with the cut stay longer 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.950
 resistant and a rigorous lateral 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.350
 one side of the other non-thick side 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:02.260
 so it does not even reach half a millimeter 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.240
 about 300 thousandths to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.000
 here must be the thickness of the 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.270
 party the quick cut to have a 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.190
 sure you're waking up benz slk 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.390
 challenged what are we going to do 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:21.520
 a thin piece of paper and tea 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.870
 come on cleaning up he saw that he did not 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.530
 it was well done 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.240
 vegetable garden pulling I will correct the fault 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:39.190
 we will see a little open in the middle will 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:40.320
 the day there is the weather and if you can 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.800
 failure 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:54.690
 Come on now, yes, listen to the noise. 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:59.860
 came the hood and the ball again O 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.750
 again without doing so much strength 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:08.760
 if you pick it up and put it on the side 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:13.180
 be 20 and fourth there perfectly saw it 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.750
 but let's watch another piece the 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.690
 Pan 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.820
 Sorry, we were not in the corner. 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.880
 let's take the corner for you to see 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:29.490
 ball saw here 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:33.340
 perfection was seen with 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.430
 great even makes a great noise 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.949
 cut of the pliers was left but you only do 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:46.210
 this here oh all of them all 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:50.439
 poor great great seems to be easy right 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:53.110
 but if you can not spin 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:55.719
 This way I taught you you have to 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.939
 overcome and take the course I will leave 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.370
