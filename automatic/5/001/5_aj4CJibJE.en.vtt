00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.529
 hello to all I spurs lifted a game of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.180
 back for a brand new video the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 youtube's famous debate 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 how much do youtuber earn for example 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.619
 like squeeze then dubai or the one you 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 want so it's very simple I want 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.500
 answer this question be I I 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 know how much to youtube hours can 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 touch on his chain but watch out I 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 immediately want to clarify for those 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 who want to know it's only with 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 the views I can not know what will 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 to win 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.180
 exactly per month you will not know 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 never how much useful organization by 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.230
 month because with all the partners 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.860
 techniques everything there beside you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.250
 will never be exactly how much 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 go win 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 so what we can really know is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.750
 a ratio to the combined monthly views is going 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.399
 win is this pretty approximate to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.590
 youtuber watches for about 1 euros 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.359
 thousand sight so you can notice that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.900
 it's still a lot for 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 some youtuber but that you if you 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 notice that there is not much of the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 tube that can live from youtube no 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.049
 more 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 in France he has a good dozen 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.290
 but a dozen on each step how much 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.759
 of unemployed in France there are two I am 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 sure there are so many young people that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.210
 there is not much that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.840
 can from youtube so it takes 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 stop this little debate two win 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 too much and that's for sure you cook before 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.180
 to go for a little over 50 million 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 leaked by month it's a super youtube 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 really does a lot of work 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.420
 himself says that for a preparation of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 videos 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.369
 he does it take a whole day so 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 are coming out almost a video a day 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.930
 a day of work so in fact 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.299
 signed by len 50 minutes but he goes 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 really worked on the life of all 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.960
 days time to go on youtube and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 where it's still youtube takes or 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 kroos part of his life still needs 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 not forget it 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.880
 certainly iain still very much 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 his band but it's not round but 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.579
 allah do not forget who does when 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 even before he got there he did 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.560
 a lot of work a lot of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.410
 critics he's also full of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.510
 of critics of how they beach there 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 told me you say bay or anything 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 but hey must also say that then dubai 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 fruit makes games the same as 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.019
 those cooking but they are trying out the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.360
 video after squeeze the screaming person 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.810
 to plagiarism in the series without even style 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.700
 play 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.099
 and sometimes these bail rifles that makes the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 video about a game after squeeze person 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.050
 did not say anything form was this debate a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.080
 little bit of plagiarism then lille 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.849
 bayou that josse cuzon so that's it with 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920
 a euro 2008 it's really not bad by 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.510
 example the cip nothing will win about 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 25000 a month 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.019
 thanks to saab after no dispute 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.299
 secondary partner all that could 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.880
 really do a lot of stuff that 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.500
 do that really a lot of work there 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.819
 must stop saying that others 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.340
 caster does not work much he 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.690
 that they have to really work a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.760
 drama and their videos really about 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.250
 several days to really do 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 wash as much as possible and also the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 he really plays for the terms for himself 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.239
 insulting plagiarism also 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
 because here it can really come out 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.260
 much more they really do 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.370
 intentions again until youtuber like 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.230
 this one so it's true that 1 euros the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.269
 a thousand just that can also see that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.829
 more dbait son enormously of views by 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.150
 month choice that is about 80 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.280
 million due per week which you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.519
 can you say that already four 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.269
 twenty thousand euros a week you re 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:33.209
 was downright huge of youtube the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.590
 more views per month in gaming and it's 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.510
 also includes the over 30 million 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.519
 subscribers so it's normal that they 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.380
 explodes like that we go where he goes 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.790
 stop because what is 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.109
 amazing is that at 30 million 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.850
 of subscribers to end up here not 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.859
 go up but they show more and more 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.970
 subscribers a day it's like squeeze to 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.500
 two million seven plus there advance as 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.780
 and as they wanted him 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 there are more and more subscribers a day 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.459
 which means that there are people who 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.079
 still do not know him and who in 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.910
 makes its popularity increase more and 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.560
 more every day and that's what is 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.700
 hallucinating for a youtuber like that 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.690
 so we have to say that the salaries of 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.670
 if you could by level always have 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.250
 still very high because it's 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.810
 the future will really go up very 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.889
 top 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.580
 then dubai sure he will win 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.780
 always a hell so money per month 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.850
 given his number of subscribers there will be 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.440
 still active physical subscribers it 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.320
 began to go up really wrong you 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 +106 when he is in the top 20 of the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.970
 youtube hours world gaming of you 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.010
 say it is not he who is nothing 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.510
 turns on the same level as here where 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.490
 youtube hours like that they have 8 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.320
 million in the united states I can you 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.960
 to say that in number of facts per month which 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.530
 I can tell you it's really huge 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.229
 what they realize not to forget so 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.060
 So that's for sure 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.220
 much when looking for even 50 years 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.940
 did better than a minister's salary 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.960
 or anything but youtube pays 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.389
 like that if you look before you 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.639
 to become the smic that has to be done about 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:13.010
 1000 the 1200 miles but 1000 1200 by 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.050
 months attract a spa romandes smic but 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.550
 I mean really start to be able to 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.380
 a little fast of youtube ie a 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.400
 million one million two hundred thousand by 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.250
 month in sight I do not know so much of 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.880
 people are able to do that really 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.810
 daily for example sir 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.120
 raise 2 realizes two million five of 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.350
 views per month for a youtuber more case 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.630
 million is still enough 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.850
 huge 2005 a month it's too much not 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.470
 criticize that but I mean for 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.850
 youtube hours like this v12 where you 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.639
 can see that to get to that 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.750
 seemed really exploded where it takes 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.510
 also be called super asshole who 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.889
 burst at the number of views per month that 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.229
 is just over 6 million views 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.300
 per month currently 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.430
 so really very well really 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.020
 excellent for him what happens to him I 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.970
 think better if it's going to be the future 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.940
 youtuber gaming of france who goes fast 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.750
 exploded so here if you want to know 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.160
 how much your youtuber fetish wins by 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.460
 example it can be whimsical a can 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.490
 be 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.530
 sipa noailles pierre yana africa and he 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.560
 there is really plenty of it can be 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.539
 super asshole rate 75 there really 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.530
 full of youtube hours you have you 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.909
 go to the site in the discussion 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.620
 slip tracker to keep number of 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.479
 tobacconists 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.000
 you tell yourself it's a euro the umih 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.740
 of it is going to calculate very quickly but after 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.030
 tell you it's not his money he 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.889
 do not know exactly what will win 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.990
 because with the partners and where he 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.460
 can earn more or like that except he 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.229
 not exactly a new enemy goal 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.419
 but a little less so that's who 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.949
 will win about in areas there this 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.630
 month since it is not necessary to say it is necessary 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.790
 also say that views by month that 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.110
 varies a lot under com - from can 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.660
 win - as he can earn more 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.729
 so here you can watch this is 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.139
 really you for this moment they 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.669
 want to see how much is this debate 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.199
 spring a lot but please 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.520
 stop saying youtuber win 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.990
 really a lot because there are some 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.060
 not so much that they will win more 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.240
 of 10,000 euros per month I can you 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.710
 say 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.660
 let's meet for a next 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.100
 video I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.050
 I know there will be some damage 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.889
 develops negative but it's relative 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.800
 in the summer on everything but I think I have 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.840
 four planes so she has that and we 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.030
 can still do more leaves so 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.970
 aj and I'm trying to attack this unit 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.120
 on the ground without success and I noticed that 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.120
 ja
