00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 all 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.809
 like everyone I hope you 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.340
 go well today I come back in 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.780
 a brand new video for you 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.440
 present the purchases I made 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.120
 today 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.309
 and to talk to you about my channel 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.500
 youtube so first I found 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.939
 this necklace that I find absolutely 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.560
 beautiful I love this color I 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.300
 find really very very beautiful I love 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.800
 the grounds so me you know I 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.970
 am a fan of collar simply 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.009
 because I think it's 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 wonderfully the outfits that 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.640
 gives a much more chic side 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.380
 a lot prettier especially when 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.610
 the outfits are hyper hyper symptoms 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.930
 were little shirts or 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.609
 rather banal things finally 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.570
 you add a little necklace like 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.680
 these and it's a beautiful anthem 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 marvelously well 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.250
 So that's a big favorite I love the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.260
 color I love the grounds too 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.910
 then I went to new look and 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.199
 I found this said we can stay in 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.359
 leaving where I was missing sv in 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.440
 so he had a lot of false eyelashes and 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.269
 it was tichanic goal that had 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.429
 really the best fossils we 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.350
 can find in France so the assignment 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.350
 of the mark to him comes back on these are 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.719
 the numbers 155 and they are wonderful 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.269
 they are super long they are really going 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.379
 indeed hyper natural finally and and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.370
 just a slab I am 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.140
 extremely fans 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.340
 so that's when I found these 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.510
 wonderful earrings of which 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.710
 you know how much I love 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.020
 earrings with several 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 colors like that so here I was 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.860
 this one from h &amp; m I'm wearing on 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.900
 me and here 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.790
 simply they are divine to his 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.840
 super super pretty and I took them 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180
 also at new look 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.680
 I also took hema 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.120
 little blunder note or that they are 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.500
 notebooks in which we can note 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.460
 all the ideas that we go through the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.710
 simply head 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 so me the ideas for youtube the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.820
 inspirations and his games the notes to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 inside January 2 why I do not 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.410
 do not know but I also found this 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.820
 so this is a proof for iphone here 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.890
 so that goes wonderfully well with 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.900
 this one did not find them that too cute 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.460
 also and that's it even if I'm not 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 extremely women of emotion I found 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.540
 it's pretty original anyway and so 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 so here are two tips I think it 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.940
 package is very very expensive which you 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.280
 would be a little bit of the exact price at which 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.380
 cost 3 euros so went see schema 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.580
 honestly it's really worth it 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.240
 you want little macbooks too I 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.740
 find it not bad 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.450
 so here I do not know if you do not 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.649
 know the notebook find me that hyper 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.920
 helpful i'm going to show you besides 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.450
 started you'll see pretty much 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.260
 so that's art and like 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.880
 this one where you have a renÃ© lazier 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.770
 just here and there I do not know if you 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.230
 go see what I wrote so 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.150
 maybe not but I really notice 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.280
 all the ideas I have for youtube 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.750
 or how to structure a video so 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.430
 our really the content of my videos 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.660
 simply we see there wait i 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.640
 will show you two more 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.410
 close so here so I really want everything 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.959
 which goes through my head simply 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.120
 and here I am so it's hyper moutier 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 so just went to see at emai 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.980
 a wide choice anyway and and that's it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.840
 so here we go and finally I took two 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.549
 adp agents simply have one for 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.230
 work and one for youtube in 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.700
 which I note all the appointments 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 important where all I can have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.630
 that it can be very important and not to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.130
 not forget especially because here I am 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.690
 am someone very organized I think 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.790
 that it's super important to have a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.040
 agenda so I have the journal my iphone 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.420
 of course but I, too, is this him 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.459
 so also to write simply 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.200
 things to remember at the source 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.519
 problem is so here are the girls 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.990
 so for my small purchases I also 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.310
 taken this top the chain you 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.440
 I find super pretty I like a lot 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.570
 the colors are the flowery reasons 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.730
 it's very fashionable even if we start 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.990
 to be in autumn but so here 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 what I meant to say about 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.850
 youtube it's just that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.650
 done now since my 2 since late 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.540
 December that I have on youtube and I'm doing 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.670
 videos regularly since six months 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.930
 a little over six months so that's so 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.610
 I just wanted to know 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.960
 category you would like to see on my 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.240
 chain we see there is what you want 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.560
 see more more fashion videos or 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.790
 then more tutorials I think the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.530
 tutos know what it is that takes the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 more time simply is what 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.280
 like the least in the end so I hesitate to 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.990
 to invest myself a lot in this 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.460
 category of videos there and I think 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.200
 rather develop other categories 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.150
 new categories like 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.740
 categories of tips tips from 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.750
 beauty of course but also of style 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.520
 fashion and so has I really told myself this 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.280
 which would interest you if you want 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.320
 see very rhythmic guys so it's up to 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.460
 to say we mix a little fashion and 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.020
 make up I think it can be nice 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.760
 also after there is a category of 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.090
 videos that particularly hold me to 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.800
 heart 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.900
 so it's really the tags and the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.580
 subjects a little east is subject in all 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.830
 kind I know you enjoyed the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.989
 tag the tac I had so you're there my 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.920
 time to machine training everything 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.930
 simply because you were able to 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.940
 know more about me so why not 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.040
 develop categories of videos 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.600
 like this one so that's it 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.890
 simply detail where I respond to 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.380
 some questions to questions 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.030
 must also pose and also 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.040
 subjects as you said so topics 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.230
 which concerns a little everyone so 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120
 subjects of life in society 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.440
 so I just think of the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.970
 self-confidence it's true often we 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.010
 tell me yes you have a lot of confidence in 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.450
 you and you know it's not necessarily the 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.860
 case I think that is really worth knowing 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.180
 to find out I think I could 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.710
 developing video categories 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.330
 like this one to give advice 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.890
 to inspire me with my career 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.790
 also so here are the fines hesitate 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.800
 not to tell me what you prefer 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.840
 what category 2 videos would you like 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.490
 see on my channel I think to invest myself 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.139
 more on youtube so very 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.849
 soon game 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.499
 much more time I will still do 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.360
 more videos than now because 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.249
 now it's mostly Saturday and the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.419
 Sunday as I saw free time but 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.759
 in any case, thank you 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.650
 infinitely all of these subscriptions so 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.389
 that they arrived very quickly must 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.849
 say and thank you very much 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.139
 a lot a lot again and always and 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.159
 I'm doing standards also aim at the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.159
 next video lease 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.930
 lamy 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.410
 little snag 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.410
 what you want 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.400
 2 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.250
 2 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
 2 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.250
 2
