00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 beauty guys here in this video I'm going 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.990
 give five tips is for you to leave your 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.770
 image sharper then let's go 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.770
 and show you 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.050
 well, the main reasons are 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.900
 you have an image with little clarity is 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.750
 is a blurred image or an image is 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.420
 out of focus then the blurred image is the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.820
 blurred it is generated by you are 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.220
 using the low shutter speed 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 beauty already images out of focus because 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.030
 you did not focus is not correctly 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.460
 was able to locate the main object 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.989
 The first tip I give is use 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.140
 high speed 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.300
 the beauty is really is that you are in 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 places in low light and you 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.899
 holding the camera in your hand try 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.940
 increase the shutter speed you want to 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.059
 you do you open up as much as you 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.280
 can the diaphragm and increase iso beauty 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.890
 not increasing iso and opening well 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.360
 diaphragm you will be able to compensate the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.340
 shutter speed then you 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.190
 increases it to a point that you 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.800
 can you take pictures with the camera in your hand 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.530
 without the image is assigned if you 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.810
 have a different tripod is there you can 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.550
 me more the speed decreased izzo 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.899
 also then another tip is always good 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.640
 you have a tripod 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.709
 So, because I'm telling you to increase the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.440
 floor is much better you have an image 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.610
 cancellation and noise of what you have 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.130
 blurred image 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.660
 already the graduation is the noise caused by 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.399
 Yes you can improve and very well, no. 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.470
 your image editing program 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.369
 already a blurred image it does not have 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.840
 repair 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.330
 that's why I say to you 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.009
 further increase is offset and laughing 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.020
 the shutter speed by remembering 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.119
 that the highest iso makes its 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.849
 image got a little blurry 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.149
 loses some of the sharpness of the image 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:02:01.450
 also the other thing that makes me lose 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:03.160
 sharpening is is you using the diaphragm above 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.250
 from f16 nÃ© 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.929
 then the more closed the diaphragm of the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.970
 your lens 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.250
 the image is getting blurry too 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.920
 is then in f2 normally where you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.370
 has the worst image quality of your 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 lens is only well past the image 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.129
 jo8 f8 where you get the best 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 quality where matt was gets sharper 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.180
 you are using a rule that is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.790
 call luau we avoid this rule 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.739
 She told you to use the speed of 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.970
 shutter higher than the distance 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.069
 of your lens 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.390
 so let's assume you have a lens 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.629
 of 50 millimeters 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.209
 goin to then he told you to use 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.299
 shutter speed by at least 1 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.400
 bar 60 tac is a little bit more than 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.859
 the focal length of your lens 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.079
 if you are using a 200 lens 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.340
 millimeters puts the speed of 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.170
 shutter in a 250 bar, it stands to reason that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 involves situations that will be more 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.040
 It's difficult, especially when you 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.109
 has low light environments 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 but whenever you can use this 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.780
 rule that beauty works something else 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.090
 also 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.120
 if you have on the lens to the stabilizer 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.790
 image you use it helps a lot 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.579
 Tip Number 3 Are You Insuring Your Camera 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.430
 correctly but also greatly influences 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.319
 So you put your hand under the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.599
 camera in your left hand 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.849
 under the bed is to support the camera 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.130
 And the right hand you holding the flu is 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.470
 to give more stability for you 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.310
 move the camera and with your fingers you go 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.870
 in the south and in focus then that is the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.519
 correct way to hold the camera 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.470
 If you are going to shoot with the camera on the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.410
 portrait mode is vertical 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.430
 you will camera counter-clockwise 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.799
 beauty 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.510
 there you put it in front of your face 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.849
 you pressed on your forehead 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.959
 also when you shoot 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.660
 vertical camera 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.849
 you turn her away she makes you cry 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.709
 you can also take pictures that 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.359
 schedule, but it sure is more 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.060
 comfortable that you will be with the 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.819
 only one hand camera that will not be 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.370
 so only you were gonna cut your body 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.919
 to take photos 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.919
 so I've always been wanted it's counter-clockwise 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.019
 It's another thing for you to train your 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.870
 inspiration also whenever you run 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.990
 at the moment you photograph pull the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.039
 holds breath okay to shoot 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.009
 You'll see what you can do. 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.539
 keep your camera more stable 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.460
 Another thing is also to put your 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.990
 arms in your body is keeping the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.870
 arms in body 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.900
 hold the camera firmly supports the well 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 your face from the shore well with your face is 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.370
 pull the inspiration, hold on there you are 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.060
 photograph 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.870
 tip number four is you use focus 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.090
 beauty to properly then what I 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.400
 I advise you not to use the dots 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.979
 auto focus are you letting 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.490
 select all the focus points of the 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.110
 your camera because she will choose in 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.690
 Her scene where she thinks she's going 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.750
 focusing on beauty has many times her 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.990
 focus is wrong so always use 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.780
 only a soft spot is 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.520
 usually the center point is the point 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.900
 is more accurate 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.120
 so you can focus on objects that 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.190
 they are moving even if it is little 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.250
 What did you have with the camera in your hand? 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.199
 use focus is automatic you will use the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.469
 manual focusing of your lens when you 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.680
 I have photographed you, uncle, it's something. 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.690
 to stop a camera on the tripod 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.150
 your object is completely stopped 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.219
 then you're using the focus is manually 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.539
 already the rest you will use the focus 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.750
 automatic so that's why I say 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.360
 For you it is also always to use the point of 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.090
 single focus is for you to select one 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.539
 object that you are you let it stay in 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.479
 powder 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.099
 tip number 5 is you do not focus and 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.310
 recompose the image 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:05.060
 this if you are using the opening 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.530
 of the other diaphragm is large as the point 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.120
 1.4 1.2 beauty 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.120
 if you use let's see who is using 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.409
 center point your camera on this one 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.240
 focus point 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.620
 so you focus on the objects you are in 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.780
 picture corner 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.789
 and then your image is not recomposed in the 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.229
 center then what will happen 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:27.090
 his object is further away from the 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:30.330
 that the center point 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.979
 so when you focus on the person 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.900
 that is in the corner then comes with the 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.099
 image with a camera with the camera to the 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.020
 center that will happen 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.639
 your people your strong point and it will already 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.360
 be more behind a bit more 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.880
 advantage 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.740
 so if you have a 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.030
 person you've focused on kino eye 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.160
 you make up 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.110
 usually what will happen the focus 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.030
 it's backwards is the eye of the person 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.720
 stay out of focus and the ear will stay 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.780
 in focus 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.910
 the table is so this is it if you have 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.140
 using very large openings then you 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.290
 You have to be very careful. 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.620
 then use is always the focus point of the 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.570
 camera that is closest to the 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.240
 its object then the second point of 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.790
 Focus more on focus if you do not 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.440
 you have to recompose the image or 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.360
 so I hope you have enjoyed it, I hope 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.010
