well<00:00:16.980> basically<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.699> lot<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> people<00:00:18.330> think

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
well basically a lot of people think

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
well basically a lot of people think
that<00:00:18.690> if<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.990> don't<00:00:19.289> eat<00:00:19.410> meat<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.650> can't<00:00:20.010> get

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that if you don't eat meat you can't get

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
that if you don't eat meat you can't get
enough<00:00:20.340> protein<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.119> reality<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
enough protein and the reality is you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.689 
enough protein and the reality is you
need<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.410> 10<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> 15<00:00:23.039> percent<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.490> calories

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
need about 10 to 15 percent of calories

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.330 
need about 10 to 15 percent of calories
from<00:00:23.970> protein<00:00:24.289> most<00:00:25.289> plant<00:00:25.650> foods<00:00:25.920> contain

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
from protein most plant foods contain

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
from protein most plant foods contain
somewhere<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> range<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
somewhere in that range and if you do a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.359 
somewhere in that range and if you do a
mix<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> plant<00:00:28.710> foods<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> average

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
mix of plant foods well the average

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.400 
mix of plant foods well the average
vegan<00:00:29.939> gets<00:00:30.150> eleven<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> fourteen<00:00:30.810> percent<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
vegan gets eleven to fourteen percent of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.319 
vegan gets eleven to fourteen percent of
calories<00:00:31.679> from<00:00:31.769> protein<00:00:31.880> pretty<00:00:32.880> much<00:00:33.059> bang

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
calories from protein pretty much bang

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
calories from protein pretty much bang
on<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.780> too<00:00:34.050> much<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.500> too<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.219> it's

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
use for protein though which on animal

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.420 
use for protein though which on animal
basis<00:00:42.300> yeah<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.780> great<00:00:43.620> sources<00:00:44.219> are

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
say well to drink drink milk to have
calcium<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.420> need<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.720> yeah

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
calcium do you really need this yeah

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.289 
calcium do you really need this yeah
well<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:19.890> need<00:01:20.130> cow's<00:01:20.520> milk<00:01:20.790> any<00:01:21.060> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
well you don't need cow's milk any more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
well you don't need cow's milk any more
than<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> need<00:01:21.750> moose<00:01:22.020> milk<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.590> honest

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
than you need moose milk to be honest

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980 
than you need moose milk to be honest
with<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.400> need<00:01:23.549> calcium<00:01:23.850> though<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
with you you need calcium though and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
with you you need calcium though and
that's<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.950> thing<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> we've<00:01:26.520> learned

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that's that's a thing that we've learned

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.450 
that's that's a thing that we've learned
you<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.840> strong<00:01:28.049> bones<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.799> important

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you to have strong bones it's important

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
you to have strong bones it's important
to<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> enough<00:01:29.970> calcium<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> issue<00:01:31.170> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to have enough calcium so the issue is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
to have enough calcium so the issue is
is<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.390> certainly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
is where do you get it and and certainly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.620 
is where do you get it and and certainly
cow's<00:01:34.530> milk<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> source<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
cow's milk is is a source so so as the

you know the thing about in a vegan diet

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.460 
you know the thing about in a vegan diet
is<00:02:07.829> there's<00:02:08.129> cal

there's calcium and everything and you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
there's calcium and everything and you
actually<00:02:13.720> absorb<00:02:14.230> calcium<00:02:14.500> better<00:02:14.980> when

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
actually absorb calcium better when

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.440 
actually absorb calcium better when
you're<00:02:15.400> eating<00:02:15.550> little<00:02:15.970> bits<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.300> it

you're eating little bits of it

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.180 
you're eating little bits of it
throughout<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.900> day<00:02:16.930> than<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.410> big<00:02:17.710> bolus

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190

and so so vegans can do very very well
with<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:22.150> calcium<00:02:22.660> if<00:02:22.900> they're<00:02:23.110> conscious

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
and if they're aware of the calcium

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.970 
and if they're aware of the calcium
sources<00:02:25.660> yeah<00:02:26.170> that's<00:02:26.440> great

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
interesting because a good chunk of the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.710 
interesting because a good chunk of the
world's<00:02:36.730> population<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.540> actually

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and they seem to do reasonably well we

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.880 
and they seem to do reasonably well we
have<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> number<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.630> very<00:02:44.230> good<00:02:44.320> studies

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
have a number of very good studies

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.980 
have a number of very good studies
looking<00:02:45.220> at<00:02:45.340> vegetarians<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.090> vegans<00:02:46.209> and

looking at vegetarians and vegans and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.260 
looking at vegetarians and vegans and
there<00:02:47.860> there<00:02:48.100> really<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.490> no<00:02:48.670> difference<00:02:49.090> in

there there really are no difference in
