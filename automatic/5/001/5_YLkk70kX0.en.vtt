Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.539
Everyone relish eating dishes prepared with sesame seeds, especially during winters.

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:21.984
We have prepared numerous things with sesame seeds and today we are making til-aata barfi with delicious taste.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.734
Let’s start with the procedure of making til-aata barfi.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:33.500
For this, firstly roast sesame seeds and wheat flour later.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:40.984
Heat a pan and place sesame seeds into it.

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:45.062
We have taken 1 cup (130 grams) sesame seeds.

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:56.664
Stir constantly and roast sesame seeds until there is slightly change in color and they get puffy.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.969
Keep check and stir constantly.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:10.273
Sesame seeds are roasted as there is change in color, seeds have turned puffy and releasing good aroma.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:16.570
It takes 2-3 minutes for roasting sesame seeds.

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:31.078
If sesame seeds are overcooked they taste bitter.

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:39.851
So keep note when sesame seeds turn slightly brown in color that means they are roasted.

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:44.430
Now we’ll roast the flour.

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.766
For this add some ghee in pan.

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.632
We have taken less than ½ cup (approx 100 grams) ghee.

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:57.281
Place 1/3 cup ghee in pan

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:06.101
Now place 1 cup (150 grams) flour into it.

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:15.617
Stir constantly and roast flour on medium flame until it turns slightly brown in color.

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:22.515
Just make sure that flour gets wet with ghee.

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:33.398
Now stir the flour constantly until it turns slightly brown in color.

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:41.242
Flour has turned brown and ghee has started separating.

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:46.710
Flour is roasted as good aroma and flavor is been released from it.

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:50.742
Turn off the flame and take out flour in a separate bowl.

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:54.484
Keep stirring for few minutes.

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:01.390
Now we’ll make sugar syrup.

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:14.937
For this add 1 cup (250 grams) sugar in pan and add ½ cup water into it.

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:24.703
Turn on the flame and cook until sugar dissolves in water and check later.

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:35.437
Meanwhile chop cashews and almonds.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:50.289
Make 8-10 small pieces of each cashew and similarly chop almonds as well.

00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:57.383
Keep constant check over sugar syrup.

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.227
Sugar is completely dissolved in water now check its consistency.

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:16.304
For this take 2-3 drops in any bowl, once cooled take syrup between your finger and thumb and stretch apart.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:20.835
We need sugar syrup with setting consistency.

00:04:21.172 --> 00:04:33.921
Sugar syrup is now ready, turn the flame to minimum and add roasted flour-sesame seeds into it.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.602
Also add chopped almonds and keep aside few for later use.

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:46.203
Add some cashews and keep rest for garnishing barfi.

00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:54.578
Add cardamom powder and mix all ingredients really well.

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:57.711
Keep the flame minimum.

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:04.797
We have mixed all ingredients nicely.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:15.960
To check, take some mixture over plate and check with your fingers.

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:18.742
It should have setting consistency.

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:23.102
Set the barfi in any plate or tray.

00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:34.656
We have a taken a plate and grease it with some ghee.

00:05:40.148 --> 00:05:43.773
Now pour the mixture into it.

00:05:46.797 --> 00:05:51.375
Evenly spread the barfi mixture with help of a spoon.

00:05:51.867 --> 00:06:02.367
Now garnish with almonds and cashews.

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.484
This enhances the taste and barfi looks more appetizing.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.648
Press them gently so that it sticks to the barfi.

00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:21.594
Now keep it aside to set.

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:29.593
Barfi is set, now cut it into pieces as per your preference.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:45.461
Separate out the barfi from plate.

00:06:56.078 --> 00:07:01.265
Scrumptious and luscious til-aata barfi is ready.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.750
Making this barfi is really easy.

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:16.968
While roasting flour, make sure you keep stirring constantly until it gets brown in color and releases good aroma.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.180
Make sugar syrup with bit thick consistency.

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:28.289
Mix all ingredients and set the barfi.

00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:38.101
