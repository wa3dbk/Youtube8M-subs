information about every movement of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
information about every movement of
their<00:00:56.910> tail<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:57.989> they're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
their tail so we know if they're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
their tail so we know if they're
swimming<00:00:58.469> fast<00:00:58.710> they're<00:00:59.129> swimming<00:00:59.309> slow<00:00:59.699> some

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
swimming fast they're swimming slow some

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.910 
swimming fast they're swimming slow some
sharks<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> rest<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> bottom<00:01:01.440> we'll<00:01:01.829> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
sharks can rest on the bottom we'll be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
sharks can rest on the bottom we'll be
able<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> tell<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:03.000> sharks<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.719> through

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
able to tell that some sharks go through

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
able to tell that some sharks go through
different<00:01:04.470> positions<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> behaviors<00:01:05.729> when

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
different positions and behaviors when

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.469 
different positions and behaviors when
they're<00:01:06.060> mating

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
they're mating

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
they're mating
some<00:01:06.960> species<00:01:07.200> night<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.799> may<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:07.979> able<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
some species night they may be able to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
some species night they may be able to
tell<00:01:08.369> us<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:08.760> feeding<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tell us when they're feeding so they can

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
tell us when they're feeding so they can
tell<00:01:10.979> us<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> things<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.850> we're

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
tell us a lot of things what we're

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
tell us a lot of things what we're
trying<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.570> captive<00:01:12.990> study<00:01:13.229> is

I<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.720> hope<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.990> tags<00:02:12.200> work<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:13.070> nice<00:02:13.250> thing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
I just hope the tags work the nice thing

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.700 
I just hope the tags work the nice thing
about<00:02:13.550> accelerometers<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.660> if<00:02:15.230> whether

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
about accelerometers is if whether

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.500 
about accelerometers is if whether
you're<00:02:15.890> studying<00:02:16.070> behavior<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:17.000> energy

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
you're studying behavior or energy

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.690 
you're studying behavior or energy
expenditure<00:02:18.140> there's<00:02:18.770> really<00:02:18.980> no<00:02:19.250> difference

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
expenditure there's really no difference

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.370 
expenditure there's really no difference
in<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> methodology<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.780> how<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.020> program

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
in the methodology of how you program

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.650 
in the methodology of how you program
the<00:02:21.680> tag<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.130> apply<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.430> tag<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.390> basically

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the tag or apply the tag so basically

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.120 
the tag or apply the tag so basically
you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.990> start<00:02:24.320> out<00:02:24.470> with<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.650> study<00:02:24.860> where

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
you can start out with a study where

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.130 
you can start out with a study where
you're<00:02:25.250> looking<00:02:25.340> at<00:02:25.520> behavior<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.240> then<00:02:26.960> go

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
you're looking at behavior and then go

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.660 
you're looking at behavior and then go
back<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.620> ask<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.920> bunch<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.340> different

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
back and ask a bunch of different

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.580 
back and ask a bunch of different
questions<00:02:29.120> about<00:02:29.450> energy<00:02:29.840> expenditure<00:02:30.410> from

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
questions about energy expenditure from

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.420 
questions about energy expenditure from
from<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> same<00:02:31.310> data<00:02:31.580> set<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.600> really<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
from the same data set so it's really a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.160 
from the same data set so it's really a
multi-faceted<00:02:34.430> tool<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.510> use<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
multi-faceted tool that you can use in a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.820 
multi-faceted tool that you can use in a
lot<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.440> different<00:02:36.709> ways<00:02:38.440> read<00:02:39.440> more<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
lot of different ways read more and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.620
