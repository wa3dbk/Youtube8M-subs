00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
little bit of see how easy that is just

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.330 
little bit of see how easy that is just
make<00:01:46.929> him<00:01:47.080> go<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:49.049> people<00:01:50.049> sometimes<00:01:50.590> don't

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340

think<00:01:51.579> well<00:01:51.759> if<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.659> using<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.140> why<00:01:53.350> not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
think well if you using this why not

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.020 
think well if you using this why not
just<00:01:53.650> get<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.860> piece<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.220> leather<00:01:54.430> be<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> lot

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
just get a piece of leather be a lot

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.039 
just get a piece of leather be a lot
nicer<00:01:55.650> well<00:01:56.650> actually<00:01:56.860> it's<00:01:57.220> not<00:01:57.310> just<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
nicer well actually it's not just the

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.649 
nicer well actually it's not just the
whether<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.430> just<00:02:00.610> mash<00:02:00.850> up<00:02:01.090> across<00:02:01.390> their

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
whether you just mash up across their

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.350 
whether you just mash up across their
whole<00:02:01.689> nose<00:02:02.140> but<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.759> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.060> squared

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
whole nose but this it's kind of squared

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.109 
whole nose but this it's kind of squared
off<00:02:04.600> over<00:02:05.079> here<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:06.640> puts<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
off over here and it just puts the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.880 
off over here and it just puts the
trenches<00:02:07.509> right<00:02:07.540> if<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.259> want<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.590> left

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
trenches right if you want to go left

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
trenches right if you want to go left
you<00:02:09.040> to<00:02:09.130> put<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> pressures<00:02:09.790> on<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.090> right

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you to put the pressures on the right

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.390 
you to put the pressures on the right
