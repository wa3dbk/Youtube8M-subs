problem solving activity for children
two<00:00:15.630> years<00:00:15.660> old<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.859> 6<00:00:17.670> years<00:00:18.000> old<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.430> we<00:00:20.430> took

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
two years old to 6 years old and we took

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.820 
two years old to 6 years old and we took
the<00:00:20.850> blocks<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.680> we<00:00:22.680> put<00:00:22.949> laminated<00:00:24.830> puzzle

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830

pieces<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.949> then<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
pieces on there and then what we do is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.659 
pieces on there and then what we do is
we<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.810> ahead<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.050> mix<00:00:31.560> all<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> puzzle

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
will here it is let's put these together

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
will here it is let's put these together
do<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> owl<00:00:53.760> oh<00:00:54.210> no<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.989> doesn't
