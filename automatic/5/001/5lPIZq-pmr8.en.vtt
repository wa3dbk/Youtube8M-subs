about it later excuse me and this is a
really<00:01:16.789> simple<00:01:17.390> operating<00:01:18.020> system<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.190> we

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
really simple operating system so we

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.580 
really simple operating system so we
have<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:20.149> only<00:01:20.390> have<00:01:20.750> slot<00:01:21.470> radio<00:01:21.830> music

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
have we only have slot radio music

settings voice recording FM radio and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.469 
settings voice recording FM radio and
just<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.990> just<00:01:30.680> about<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.189> we<00:01:32.060> don't<00:01:32.240> have

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
just that just about it we don't have

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.840 
just that just about it we don't have
much<00:01:32.540> music<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> but<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.280> doesn't<00:01:34.700> matter

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
much music on it but it doesn't matter

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.840 
much music on it but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.750> doesn't<00:01:36.290> have<00:01:36.439> speakers

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
because it doesn't have speakers

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.050 
because it doesn't have speakers
customers<00:01:37.850> again<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.810> doesn't<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:39.530> speakers

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
customers again it doesn't have speakers

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.580 
customers again it doesn't have speakers
so<00:01:41.060> you'll<00:01:41.420> have<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.990> use<00:01:42.170> your<00:01:42.350> head<00:01:42.560> for

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
so you'll have it to use your head for

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.280 
so you'll have it to use your head for
very<00:01:42.950> simple<00:01:43.400> operating<00:01:44.119> system<00:01:44.150> not<00:01:44.840> much<00:01:45.049> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
very simple operating system not much to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.080
