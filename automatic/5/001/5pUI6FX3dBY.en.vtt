 and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.270
 i 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.120
 active 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.820
 the rufino tamayo museum is presenting 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.160
 the exhibition pretentiously and ironically 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.200
 entitled there is more route than ours 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.180
 where he presumes to us his stars of the 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.000
 contemporary art like teresa margolles 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.710
 carlos amorales and of course the king 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.020
 midas of contemporary art 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.370
 gabriel orozco from whom we can admire 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.370
 this wonder 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.350
 according to the advanced and high vision of the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.960
 curator this announcement makes an allusion 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.330
 to Mexican muralism and deploy 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.220
 possible critical readings regarding the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.090
 iconographic realism of the school 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.090
 mexican painting 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.880
 I can not imagine what those meetings will be like 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.980
 where intellectuals come together to 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 write tremendous texts 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.700
 curatorial 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 we were so happy 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.450
 We were with silly monkey girl 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.259
 I'm not asking 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.259
 radiant 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 do not tell you mysteries of art without 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 solve is an impartial thing let's 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.360
 listen to the artist on their own 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.360
 words 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.120
 although my work can talk about 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.200
 wasted of poverty or of what 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.840
 we call trash 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.490
 when doing my work it is not 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 in fact, it disturbs me when something comes out 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.900
 too expensive 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.470
 in the process of trying it is wasted 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.470
 too much material 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.780
 with economic science 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.640
 is 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 an ethical stance 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.250
 and speaking of economic awareness and 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.659
 ethical positions should be asked 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.670
 to the state when they spent the 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.319
 past administrations buying from 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.319
 work a gabriel or ' when they believe 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.219
 now this thing is not part of the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.950
 collection of the size but being a 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.650
 significant and significant work 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 transcendent for Mexican art 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 the museum could not let the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 opportunity to exhibit it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.740
 or at least that's what the text says 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.810
 of salt if you ask me I'll 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.970
 attributes the success to this type of pieces 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.460
 that the new intellectuals of 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.410
 our city have poked their heads 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.660
 a little beyond where is your 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.790
 natural habitat and apparently have been 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.740
 stayed biscÃ³s and amazed with the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.960
 popular iconography since we 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.240
 we have to gather every day in 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.280
 our colonies however the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.200
 mystery that this magna leaves us 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.170
 exhibition and it would be interesting that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.300
 these intellectuals answer us is 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.060
 gentlemen if there really is more route than 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.890
 yours please tell us where because 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.860
 you have taken practically 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.380
 all the museums of this city good 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.390
 they miss the wax museum the museum of the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.450
 pocket and I think the museum's 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.880
 telegraph in short the point is that those who 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.010
 We enjoyed visiting the museums already 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.200
 we are a little bit bored of arriving and 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.140
 always to find ourselves with the same 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.870
 occurrences of the same people and not 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.210
 to see even an exhibition 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.120
 worthy 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.750
 that people are outraged and the truth 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.820
 it's okay 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.440
 when people think that something 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.290
 you did it is very easy and they themselves 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.480
 they could do is that you're fine because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.450
 it means that these people never had 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.300
 the eggs to do it was so easy but 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.590
 they were never foreseen then there is something 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.590
 that all humans that we have 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.340
 what
