00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.410 
p OB so personal locating beacon
provides<00:00:12.750> information<00:00:13.019> such<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:13.910> your<00:00:14.910> GPS

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
provides information such as your GPS

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.359 
provides information such as your GPS
location<00:00:15.529> your<00:00:16.529> bearing<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> where<00:00:17.250> you're

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
location your bearing to where you're

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
location your bearing to where you're
going<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.390> far<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:18.869> away<00:00:18.930> from<00:00:19.109> your

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of the water to give the best signal and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
of the water to give the best signal and
there's<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.830> area<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> actual<00:01:20.909> device

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there's an area on the actual device
