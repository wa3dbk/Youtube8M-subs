bushing<00:00:37.210> is<00:00:37.390> worn<00:00:37.720> out<00:00:37.900> where<00:00:38.589> the<00:00:38.650> boat<00:00:38.830> goes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
bushing is worn out where the boat goes

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.350 
bushing is worn out where the boat goes
through<00:00:39.339> so<00:00:39.850> we're<00:00:39.970> going<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.269> to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
through so we're going to have to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.060 
through so we're going to have to
replace<00:00:40.629> both<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.110> those<00:00:41.229> they're<00:00:41.589> both<00:00:41.799> bad

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
replace both of those they're both bad

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.539 
replace both of those they're both bad

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
okay and in order to remove these shacks

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.599 
okay and in order to remove these shacks
is<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:41.170> bolts<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.740> top<00:01:41.770> one<00:01:42.219> of<00:01:42.399> them

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
is to bolts on the top one of them

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.209 
is to bolts on the top one of them
they're<00:01:43.450> 18<00:01:43.750> millimeter<00:01:44.170> nuts<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.770> 18

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
they're 18 millimeter nuts and 18

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.310 
they're 18 millimeter nuts and 18
millimeter<00:01:45.670> headed<00:01:45.880> bolts<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:47.170> one

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
millimeter headed bolts this one

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.289 
millimeter headed bolts this one
actually<00:01:47.439> has<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> nut<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.280> separate<00:01:49.149> this

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
actually has a nut that separate this

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually has a nut that separate this
one<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.600> welded<00:01:50.140> nut<00:01:50.289> on<00:01:50.469> top<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:50.860> have<00:01:51.159> to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
one is a welded nut on top so I have to

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.069 
one is a welded nut on top so I have to
do<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.549> remove<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.000> bolt<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.420> have<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.929> worry

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
do is remove the bolt you have to worry

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:48.240 
do is remove the bolt you have to worry
about<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.469> nut<00:01:53.649> side<00:02:46.709> here's<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.829> old<00:02:47.980> shack

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
about the nut side here's the old shack

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460 
about the nut side here's the old shack
is<00:02:48.459> on<00:02:48.609> a<00:02:48.639> vehicle<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.450> other<00:02:50.139> than<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
is on a vehicle and other than the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.470 
is on a vehicle and other than the
bushings<00:02:50.829> being<00:02:51.069> bed<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.549> also<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.880> bad<00:02:52.180> shock

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
bushings being bed is also a bad shock

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.199 
bushings being bed is also a bad shock
anyway<00:02:52.959> why<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> push<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.069> all<00:02:54.190> up<00:02:54.310> again<00:02:54.400> pretty

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
anyway why I push it all up again pretty

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.940 
anyway why I push it all up again pretty
much<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.510> one's<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.840> stay<00:02:56.049> down<00:02:56.230> comes<00:02:56.799> up

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
much this one's a stay down comes up

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.720 
much this one's a stay down comes up
real<00:02:57.190> slow<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.730> he's<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> root<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.690> replaced

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
real slow so he's a root be replaced

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.490 
real slow so he's a root be replaced
after<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.940> got<00:03:01.120> these<00:03:01.299> bolt<00:03:01.600> out<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.350> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
after I got these bolt out and in the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.289 
after I got these bolt out and in the
shock<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.040> took<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> look<00:03:03.549> at<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.850> boat<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.239> I

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
shock I took a look at this boat and I

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.849 
shock I took a look at this boat and I
see<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.630> it's<00:03:04.780> real<00:03:04.989> worn<00:03:05.290> out<00:03:05.470> where<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
see that it's real worn out where it

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.910 
see that it's real worn out where it
sits<00:03:06.069> inside<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:06.910> bushing<00:03:07.209> here<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.319> I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
sits inside of this bushing here and I

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.009 
sits inside of this bushing here and I
fired<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.700> prior<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.209> problem<00:03:10.599> because<00:03:10.870> it's

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
fired it prior to problem because it's

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.660 
fired it prior to problem because it's
real<00:03:11.200> loose<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.650> there<00:03:11.859> that's<00:03:12.250> probably<00:03:12.489> part

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
real loose in there that's probably part

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.069 
real loose in there that's probably part
of<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.849> sound<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.359> we're<00:03:13.540> hearing<00:03:13.569> so

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
of the sound that we we're hearing so

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.780 
of the sound that we we're hearing so
not<00:03:14.829> only<00:03:14.889> are<00:03:15.069> we<00:03:15.099> going<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> replace<00:03:15.639> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
not only are we going to replace the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.309 
not only are we going to replace the
shocks<00:03:16.030> when<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.359> replace<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.870> bolt<00:03:17.079> so

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
shocks when I replace the bolt so

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.770 
shocks when I replace the bolt so
because<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.859> take<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.069> look<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:19.540> zoom

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
because if you take a look if you zoom

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.670 
because if you take a look if you zoom
in<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.079> take<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.260> look<00:03:20.470> at<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.829> you'll<00:03:21.160> see

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
in and take a look at this you'll see
