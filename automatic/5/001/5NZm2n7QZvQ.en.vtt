hi guys my name's Rick shields down here

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.440 
hi guys my name's Rick shields down here
at<00:00:06.040> truffle<00:00:06.310> girl<00:00:06.430> Center<00:00:06.700> in<00:00:06.760> Manchester<00:00:06.910> and

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
at truffle girl Center in Manchester and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.330 
at truffle girl Center in Manchester and
we're<00:00:07.570> going<00:00:07.690> to<00:00:07.750> be<00:00:07.810> doing<00:00:07.900> some<00:00:08.200> g30<00:00:08.890> testing

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
we're going to be doing some g30 testing

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.820 
we're going to be doing some g30 testing
today<00:00:09.580> we've<00:00:10.150> got<00:00:10.300> the<00:00:10.480> original<00:00:10.720> G<00:00:11.170> 30<00:00:11.410> and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
today we've got the original G 30 and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.340 
today we've got the original G 30 and
we've<00:00:12.160> got<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.550> slightly<00:00:13.390> different<00:00:13.780> G<00:00:14.110> 30

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
we've got the slightly different G 30

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.660 
we've got the slightly different G 30
which<00:00:14.590> is<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:14.769> LS<00:00:15.600> tech<00:00:16.600> low-spin<00:00:17.670> technology

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
which is the LS tech low-spin technology

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.609 
which is the LS tech low-spin technology
I'm<00:00:18.880> going<00:00:19.360> to<00:00:19.420> using<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.750> same<00:00:20.020> shaft<00:00:20.410> and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
I'm going to using the same shaft and

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.570 
I'm going to using the same shaft and
their<00:00:20.740> head-to-head

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
their head-to-head

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.210 
their head-to-head
five<00:00:21.940> shots<00:00:22.150> each<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.690> see<00:00:23.380> if<00:00:23.710> there's<00:00:24.100> any

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
five shots each and see if there's any

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.800 
five shots each and see if there's any
difference<00:00:24.369> in<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.760> spin<00:00:25.000> this<00:00:25.150> should<00:00:25.510> on

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
difference in the spin this should on

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.150 
difference in the spin this should on
paper<00:00:26.470> be<00:00:27.190> anywhere<00:00:27.460> between<00:00:27.580> 300<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.270> 500

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
paper be anywhere between 300 and 500

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.849 
paper be anywhere between 300 and 500
RPM<00:00:30.160> different<00:00:30.730> on<00:00:30.880> spin<00:00:31.539> so<00:00:32.529> I'm<00:00:32.619> going<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:32.769> be

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:32.859 
RPM different on spin so I'm going to be

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.459 
RPM different on spin so I'm going to be

distance<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.350> really<00:01:50.590> didn't<00:01:50.800> massively

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
distance it really didn't massively

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.620 
distance it really didn't massively
perform<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:51.880> think<00:01:52.060> that's<00:01:52.180> just<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.450> little

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
perform and I think that's just a little

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.170 
perform and I think that's just a little
bit<00:01:52.900> because<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.350> spin<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.970> was<00:01:55.060> just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
bit because of the spin when I was just

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.330 
bit because of the spin when I was just
on<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.300> air<00:01:55.480> last<00:01:55.600> tech<00:01:55.930> one<00:01:56.229> distance<00:01:57.190> was

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
on the air last tech one distance was

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.790 
on the air last tech one distance was
right<00:01:57.520> up<00:01:57.670> there<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.030> let's<00:01:58.210> see<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:58.960> there's

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
right up there so let's see if there's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.539 
right up there so let's see if there's
much<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.130> difference<00:02:00.159> now<00:02:00.700> head<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.180> head

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.180 

so<00:02:07.549> decent<00:02:08.179> start<00:02:08.539> from<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.929> original<00:02:09.709> G<00:02:09.890> 30

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
so decent start from the original G 30

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.360 
so decent start from the original G 30
that's<00:02:11.120> got<00:02:11.650> just<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> normal<00:02:13.040> weight<00:02:13.160> at<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
that's got just a normal weight at the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.900 
that's got just a normal weight at the
back

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
back

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.699 
back
I'm<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.050> particularly<00:02:15.319> look<00:02:15.470> at

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
I'm not going to particularly look at

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.780 
I'm not going to particularly look at
any<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> figures<00:02:16.280> your<00:02:16.430> share<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:16.670> going

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
any of the figures your share I'm going

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.920 
any of the figures your share I'm going
to<00:02:16.849> show<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> shots<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:17.569> I'm<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:17.780> going

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
to show you the shots but I'm not going

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.210 
to show you the shots but I'm not going
to<00:02:17.989> look<00:02:18.050> at<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> figures<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.770> yet<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to look at the figures just yet the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.910 
to look at the figures just yet the
owner<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.810> become<00:02:21.140> trying<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> change

owner you know become trying to change

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680 
owner you know become trying to change
the<00:02:22.340> numbers<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.790> spin<00:02:23.060> numbers<00:02:23.420> or<00:02:23.510> anything

the numbers to spin numbers or anything

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.120 
the numbers to spin numbers or anything
else<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.290> going<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.440> hit<00:02:24.560> five<00:02:24.830> shots

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
else I'm just going to hit five shots

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.910 
else I'm just going to hit five shots
and<00:02:25.459> then<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> look<00:02:27.410> at<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.560> figures<00:02:27.800> at

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
and then have a look at the figures at

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then have a look at the figures at
the<00:02:27.950> end<00:02:35.860> let's<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:36.980> three<00:02:37.280> more<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.670> then

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
the end let's go three more and then

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.680 
the end let's go three more and then
we'll<00:02:38.060> swap<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> head<00:02:39.200> round<00:02:40.390> see<00:02:41.390> what's<00:02:41.569> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
we'll swap the head round see what's the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:56.210 
we'll swap the head round see what's the
difference

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.530 

right<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.420> they're<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.690> five<00:02:59.150> like<00:03:00.150> I'm<00:03:00.360> not

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
right so they're the five like I'm not

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.810 
right so they're the five like I'm not
going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> look<00:03:00.990> at<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> distances<00:03:01.800> look<00:03:02.730> at

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
going to look at the distances look at

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.520 
going to look at the distances look at
the<00:03:02.910> spin<00:03:03.120> rates<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.570> distances<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.350> yet

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the spin rates or the distances just yet

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.140 
the spin rates or the distances just yet
when<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.710> hold<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.070> fire<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.610> moment

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
when I hold that fire for a moment

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.450 
when I hold that fire for a moment
felt<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.780> good<00:03:06.990> hits<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.440> hit<00:03:07.560> one<00:03:07.740> left<00:03:08.010> but

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
felt like good hits I hit one left but

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.620 
felt like good hits I hit one left but
the<00:03:08.550> rest<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:09.000> were<00:03:09.120> pretty<00:03:09.240> much<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the rest of them were pretty much in the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.010 
the rest of them were pretty much in the
middle<00:03:10.370> swap<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.460> heads<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:12.210> what<00:03:12.330> low<00:03:12.630> spin

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
middle swap the heads see what low spin

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.040 
middle swap the heads see what low spin
tech<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.860> do<00:03:14.210> same<00:03:15.210> loft<00:03:15.630> I've<00:03:15.780> got<00:03:15.930> both

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
tech can do same loft I've got both

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.990 
tech can do same loft I've got both
these<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.440> well<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.800> nine<00:03:17.040> point<00:03:17.370> nine<00:03:17.640> degrees

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
these as well as nine point nine degrees

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.490 
these as well as nine point nine degrees
of<00:03:18.030> loft<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.510> I've<00:03:18.600> moved<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.990> down<00:03:19.020> point

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
of loft so I've moved it down point

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.560 
of loft so I've moved it down point
stick<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> degree<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.340> both<00:03:20.580> same<00:03:21.300> shaft

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
stick to the degree in both same shaft

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.050 
stick to the degree in both same shaft
and<00:03:21.780> let's<00:03:21.960> see<00:03:22.080> what<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> LS<00:03:22.770> tech<00:03:23.100> has<00:03:23.790> to

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and let's see what the LS tech has to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.370 
and let's see what the LS tech has to
offer<00:03:24.240> if<00:03:24.660> there's<00:03:24.810> any<00:03:24.930> difference<00:03:25.380> at<00:03:25.500> all

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.920 

right<00:03:33.330> LS<00:03:34.330> tech<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.830> on<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.940> like<00:03:37.540> say<00:03:37.720> from

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
right LS tech is on so like say from

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.420 
right LS tech is on so like say from
above<00:03:38.170> there's<00:03:38.410> no<00:03:38.500> difference<00:03:38.920> at<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.190> it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
above there's no difference at all it's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.560 
above there's no difference at all it's
just<00:03:39.490> that<00:03:39.700> weight<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.120> moved<00:03:40.330> further

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
just that weight is moved further

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.220 
just that weight is moved further
forward

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
forward

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.930 
forward
it's<00:03:41.530> got<00:03:41.680> matte<00:03:42.070> finish<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.550> because<00:03:42.820> it

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
it's got matte finish just because it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.400 
it's got matte finish just because it
helps<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.300> stand<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.630> differently<00:03:44.080> I'm<00:03:44.170> sure

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
helps it stand out differently I'm sure

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.620 
helps it stand out differently I'm sure
nine<00:03:45.310> point<00:03:45.550> nine<00:03:45.670> degree<00:03:45.940> same<00:03:46.180> shaft<00:03:46.450> as<00:03:46.570> you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
nine point nine degree same shaft as you

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.270 
nine point nine degree same shaft as you
just<00:03:46.780> saw<00:03:46.990> five<00:03:47.620> shots<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.070> need<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
just saw five shots I just need to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.730 
just saw five shots I just need to
change<00:03:48.520> this<00:03:48.790> on<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.240> sim<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.410> we've<00:03:50.710> got

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
change this on the sim so that we've got

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.960 
change this on the sim so that we've got
a<00:03:50.920> different<00:03:51.280> color<00:03:51.430> line<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:53.160> we<00:03:54.160> are<00:03:54.460> good

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
a different color line and we are good

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.830 
a different color line and we are good
to<00:03:55.300> go

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
to go

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.370 
to go
so<00:03:55.990> five<00:03:56.350> shots<00:03:56.620> again<00:03:57.360> let's<00:03:58.360> see<00:03:58.750> if<00:03:58.990> there's

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
so five shots again let's see if there's

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:09.690 
so five shots again let's see if there's
any<00:03:59.590> difference<00:03:59.890> between<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.520> two<00:04:08.459> I've<00:04:09.459> felt

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
any difference between the two I've felt

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.620 
any difference between the two I've felt
really<00:04:09.880> nice<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:12.550> it's<00:04:12.700> about<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.300> distance

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
really nice but it's about the distance

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.000 
really nice but it's about the distance
in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> end<00:04:13.990> I<00:04:14.170> exam<00:04:14.500> that's<00:04:14.650> not<00:04:14.860> going<00:04:14.950> to

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
in the end I exam that's not going to

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:32.520 
in the end I exam that's not going to
look<00:04:15.100> anything<00:04:15.490> just<00:04:15.730> yet<00:04:17.280> right<00:04:18.280> at<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.489> end

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.540 

alright<00:04:33.520> guys<00:04:33.700> there's<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.240> five<00:04:35.370> with<00:04:36.370> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
alright guys there's the five with the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.240 
alright guys there's the five with the
original<00:04:37.180> G<00:04:37.330> 30<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.380> low-spin<00:04:39.250> tech<00:04:41.250> any

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
original G 30 and the low-spin tech any

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.250 
original G 30 and the low-spin tech any
feedback<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:42.760> got<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.270> would<00:04:43.510> say<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.840> low-spin

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
feedback I got I would say the low-spin

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.570 
feedback I got I would say the low-spin
tech<00:04:44.500> felt<00:04:44.830> like<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.070> was<00:04:45.190> come<00:04:45.280> out<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.400> little

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
tech felt like it was come out a little

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.340 
tech felt like it was come out a little
bit<00:04:45.760> lower<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.330> don't<00:04:46.990> know

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
bit lower I don't know

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.700 
bit lower I don't know
weirdly<00:04:48.130> felt<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.580> could<00:04:48.790> spin<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.150> bit<00:04:49.270> less

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
weirdly felt I could spin in a bit less

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.930 
weirdly felt I could spin in a bit less
seems<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.800> be<00:04:50.890> going<00:04:50.980> further<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:51.490> not<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:51.790> any

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
seems to be going further but not so any

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.240 
seems to be going further but not so any
figures<00:04:52.270> yet<00:04:52.450> let's<00:04:52.750> pull<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.260> charts<00:04:53.830> and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
figures yet let's pull up the charts and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.770 
figures yet let's pull up the charts and
let's<00:04:54.490> see<00:04:54.700> what<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.150> differences<00:04:55.570> between

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
let's see what the differences between

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.150 
let's see what the differences between
the<00:04:56.170> original<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.370> LS<00:04:57.820> tech<00:04:58.890> right<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.040> we've

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
the original and LS tech right so we've

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.640 
the original and LS tech right so we've
got<00:05:00.190> all<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.270> 10<00:05:01.930> shots<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.290> hit<00:05:02.380> with

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
got all of the 10 shots that hit with

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.920 
got all of the 10 shots that hit with
both<00:05:02.920> of<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.190> club<00:05:03.370> 5<00:05:03.580> each<00:05:03.760> app<00:05:04.390> on<00:05:04.600> screen

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
both of the club 5 each app on screen

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.250 
both of the club 5 each app on screen
now<00:05:05.160> top<00:05:06.160> 5<00:05:06.400> is<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:07.090> G<00:05:07.270> 30<00:05:07.510> original<00:05:08.110> one

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
now top 5 is the G 30 original one

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.659 
now top 5 is the G 30 original one
bottom<00:05:09.130> 5<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.760> low-spin<00:05:10.300> tech<00:05:10.660> 1<00:05:10.960> LS<00:05:11.350> tech

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
bottom 5 is the low-spin tech 1 LS tech

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.250 
bottom 5 is the low-spin tech 1 LS tech
let's<00:05:12.669> go<00:05:12.820> across<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.510> see<00:05:13.660> what<00:05:13.870> difference

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
let's go across and see what difference

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.500 
let's go across and see what difference
are<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:14.560> clubhead<00:05:14.830> speed<00:05:14.940> 1<00:05:15.940> mile<00:05:16.120> per<00:05:16.150> hour<00:05:16.360> in

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
are so clubhead speed 1 mile per hour in

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.290 
are so clubhead speed 1 mile per hour in
it<00:05:16.630> not<00:05:16.810> much<00:05:16.990> at<00:05:17.140> all<00:05:17.350> nothing<00:05:18.190> please<00:05:19.090> laughs

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
it not much at all nothing please laughs

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.330 
it not much at all nothing please laughs
not<00:05:19.540> different<00:05:19.930> ball<00:05:20.169> speed<00:05:20.440> pretty<00:05:21.070> much<00:05:21.250> to

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
not different ball speed pretty much to

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.409 
not different ball speed pretty much to
say<00:05:21.460> none<00:05:21.640> of<00:05:21.730> these<00:05:21.820> should<00:05:22.090> have<00:05:22.150> changed

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
say none of these should have changed

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.320 
say none of these should have changed
anyway<00:05:22.980> launch<00:05:23.980> angle<00:05:24.430> interestingly<00:05:24.970> is

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
anyway launch angle interestingly is

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.820 
anyway launch angle interestingly is
even<00:05:25.690> though<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.900> lofts<00:05:26.140> are<00:05:26.380> exactly<00:05:26.680> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
even though the lofts are exactly the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.070 
even though the lofts are exactly the
same<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.310> launch<00:05:27.550> angle<00:05:27.820> on<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.270> LS<00:05:28.630> tech<00:05:28.930> has

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
same the launch angle on the LS tech has

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.560 
same the launch angle on the LS tech has
actually<00:05:29.440> got<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.650> little<00:05:29.860> bit<00:05:30.070> higher<00:05:30.570> which

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
actually got a little bit higher which

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.820 
actually got a little bit higher which
was<00:05:31.690> rather<00:05:31.840> felt<00:05:32.320> like<00:05:32.500> they<00:05:32.590> were<00:05:32.650> going<00:05:32.770> a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
was rather felt like they were going a

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.690 
was rather felt like they were going a
little<00:05:32.919> bit<00:05:33.070> low<00:05:33.190> but<00:05:33.220> they've<00:05:33.460> got<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:33.610> little

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
little bit low but they've got a little

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.360 
little bit low but they've got a little
bit<00:05:33.820> higher<00:05:34.030> just<00:05:34.270> fine<00:05:34.890> spin<00:05:35.890> number<00:05:36.040> this<00:05:36.250> is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
bit higher just fine spin number this is

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.000 
bit higher just fine spin number this is
one<00:05:36.520> wrong<00:05:37.050> total<00:05:38.050> spin<00:05:38.940> has<00:05:39.940> dropped<00:05:41.010> with

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
one wrong total spin has dropped with

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.510 
one wrong total spin has dropped with
the<00:05:42.130> LS<00:05:42.430> tech<00:05:42.700> but<00:05:43.330> not<00:05:43.600> by<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:44.250> massive<00:05:45.250> amount

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
the LS tech but not by a massive amount

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.150 
the LS tech but not by a massive amount
so<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.840> normal<00:05:47.050> G<00:05:47.260> 30<00:05:47.500> was<00:05:48.330> 2285<00:05:50.160> lowest

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
so the the normal G 30 was 2285 lowest

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.560 
so the the normal G 30 was 2285 lowest
one<00:05:51.280> was<00:05:51.400> mm<00:05:52.030> highest<00:05:52.330> one<00:05:52.450> was

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
one was mm highest one was

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.690 
one was mm highest one was
two-and-a-half<00:05:52.840> thousand<00:05:53.590> so<00:05:54.340> kind<00:05:54.550> of<00:05:54.610> in

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
two-and-a-half thousand so kind of in

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.409 
two-and-a-half thousand so kind of in
that<00:05:54.820> range<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:56.290> LS<00:05:56.650> tech<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.640> spin<00:05:58.300> rate

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
that range and the LS tech the spin rate

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.690 
that range and the LS tech the spin rate
was<00:05:59.100> 2108<00:06:00.130> so<00:06:00.940> it's<00:06:01.060> come<00:06:01.330> down<00:06:01.600> a<00:06:01.960> hundred

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
was 2108 so it's come down a hundred

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.330 
was 2108 so it's come down a hundred
eighty<00:06:03.700> rpm<00:06:04.620> which<00:06:05.620> is<00:06:05.770> not<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:05.950> great<00:06:06.190> deal

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
eighty rpm which is not a great deal

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.070 
eighty rpm which is not a great deal
really<00:06:06.729> not<00:06:07.060> massive<00:06:07.510> deal<00:06:07.630> but<00:06:07.810> it<00:06:07.870> has

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
really not massive deal but it has

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.290 
really not massive deal but it has
dropped<00:06:08.440> it<00:06:08.650> has<00:06:08.800> come<00:06:09.040> down<00:06:09.070> which<00:06:10.030> is<00:06:10.180> what

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
dropped it has come down which is what

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.060 
dropped it has come down which is what
it's<00:06:10.419> designed<00:06:10.510> to<00:06:10.810> do<00:06:10.960> now<00:06:11.320> in<00:06:11.680> other<00:06:11.770> hands

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
it's designed to do now in other hands

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.980 
it's designed to do now in other hands
it<00:06:12.190> might<00:06:12.340> come<00:06:12.520> down<00:06:12.550> even<00:06:12.940> further<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.780> sane

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
it might come down even further the sane

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.290 
it might come down even further the sane
anywhere<00:06:14.320> between<00:06:14.470> 300<00:06:15.070> and<00:06:15.100> 500<00:06:15.430> am<00:06:15.820> just<00:06:16.090> out

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
anywhere between 300 and 500 am just out

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.740 
anywhere between 300 and 500 am just out
of<00:06:16.479> that<00:06:16.630> quota<00:06:17.020> but<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:17.890> still<00:06:18.070> dropped

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
of that quota but it is still dropped

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.790 
of that quota but it is still dropped
let's<00:06:19.750> have<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:19.900> look<00:06:20.020> at<00:06:20.110> and<00:06:20.229> this<00:06:20.410> what's

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
let's have a look at and this what's

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.080 
let's have a look at and this what's
done<00:06:21.010> to<00:06:21.040> distance<00:06:21.669> I<00:06:21.850> hit<00:06:22.660> 4<00:06:23.650> on<00:06:23.979> both<00:06:24.790> of<00:06:25.030> the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
done to distance I hit 4 on both of the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.120 
done to distance I hit 4 on both of the
clubs<00:06:25.330> pretty<00:06:25.750> well<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.110> hit<00:06:26.350> one<00:06:26.380> left<00:06:26.830> with

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
clubs pretty well I hit one left with

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.400 
clubs pretty well I hit one left with
both<00:06:27.430> so<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.240> kept<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:28.810> in<00:06:28.870> because<00:06:29.260> they<00:06:29.350> were

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
both so I kept that in because they were

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.750 
both so I kept that in because they were
pretty<00:06:29.620> much<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:29.950> same<00:06:29.979> shot<00:06:30.370> that<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.610> hit

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
pretty much the same shot that I hit

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.820 
pretty much the same shot that I hit
just<00:06:31.330> fighting<00:06:31.570> that<00:06:31.660> last<00:06:31.870> shot<00:06:32.080> but<00:06:32.290> the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
just fighting that last shot but the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.040 
just fighting that last shot but the
other<00:06:33.010> 4<00:06:33.190> was<00:06:33.310> pretty<00:06:33.340> straight<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:34.330> LS<00:06:34.750> tech

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
other 4 was pretty straight the LS tech

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.280 
other 4 was pretty straight the LS tech
for<00:06:35.320> me<00:06:35.500> with<00:06:36.190> its<00:06:36.370> lower<00:06:36.669> spin<00:06:37.060> and<00:06:37.330> bizarrely

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
for me with its lower spin and bizarrely

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.200 
for me with its lower spin and bizarrely
slightly<00:06:38.860> higher<00:06:39.040> launch<00:06:39.310> has<00:06:39.669> traveled

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
slightly higher launch has traveled

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.600 
slightly higher launch has traveled
further<00:06:40.960> it's<00:06:41.320> gone<00:06:41.500> another<00:06:41.740> 6<00:06:42.099> yards<00:06:42.400> in<00:06:42.520> the

further it's gone another 6 yards in the

air

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.160

though<00:06:43.790> therefore<00:06:44.790> total<00:06:45.150> distance<00:06:45.540> is<00:06:45.690> six

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
with the G 30 so there is a difference

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.850 
with the G 30 so there is a difference
not<00:06:54.630> maybe<00:06:54.840> the<00:06:55.020> biggest<00:06:55.230> difference<00:06:55.650> in<00:06:55.770> the

not maybe the biggest difference in the

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.230 
not maybe the biggest difference in the
world<00:06:56.070> but<00:06:56.250> they<00:06:56.400> can<00:06:56.520> only<00:06:56.610> do<00:06:56.850> a<00:06:56.880> small

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
world but they can only do a small

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.730 
world but they can only do a small
amount<00:06:57.450> with<00:06:57.630> the<00:06:57.660> center<00:06:58.170> of<00:06:58.230> gravity<00:06:58.590> only

moving<00:06:59.070> it<00:06:59.250> closer<00:06:59.820> and<00:07:00.030> further<00:07:00.330> away<00:07:00.480> but

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
moving it closer and further away but

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.740 
moving it closer and further away but
for<00:07:01.590> a<00:07:01.620> drive<00:07:02.160> a<00:07:02.340> golfer<00:07:02.850> that<00:07:02.940> maybe<00:07:03.150> spun<00:07:03.600> the

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
for a drive a golfer that maybe spun the

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.250 
for a drive a golfer that maybe spun the
G<00:07:03.930> 30<00:07:04.170> too<00:07:04.590> much<00:07:04.800> they've<00:07:05.310> brought<00:07:05.610> out<00:07:05.790> a

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
G 30 too much they've brought out a

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.210 
G 30 too much they've brought out a
alternative<00:07:07.260> they've<00:07:07.500> brought<00:07:07.680> out<00:07:07.800> a<00:07:07.830> driver

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
alternative they've brought out a driver

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.580 
alternative they've brought out a driver
that's<00:07:08.820> suited<00:07:09.480> for<00:07:09.570> fast<00:07:09.810> swing<00:07:10.020> speeds<00:07:10.380> who

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
that's suited for fast swing speeds who

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.280 
that's suited for fast swing speeds who
can<00:07:10.800> spin<00:07:11.070> it<00:07:11.160> low<00:07:11.600> the<00:07:12.600> finish<00:07:12.870> looks<00:07:13.050> great

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
can spin it low the finish looks great

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.250 
can spin it low the finish looks great
and<00:07:14.010> it's<00:07:14.220> definitely<00:07:15.060> one<00:07:15.510> that<00:07:15.720> is<00:07:15.900> going<00:07:16.170> to

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
and it's definitely one that is going to

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.870 
and it's definitely one that is going to
be<00:07:16.320> challenging<00:07:16.560> against<00:07:17.160> some<00:07:17.700> of<00:07:17.790> the

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
be challenging against some of the

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.230 
be challenging against some of the
club's<00:07:18.120> that<00:07:18.510> are<00:07:18.630> currently<00:07:18.990> in<00:07:19.140> my<00:07:19.230> bag<00:07:19.410> um

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
between the G 30 and the LS Tek is it

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.110 
between the G 30 and the LS Tek is it
something<00:07:29.220> that<00:07:29.370> you<00:07:29.520> even<00:07:29.790> thought<00:07:29.940> was

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
something that you even thought was

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.240 
something that you even thought was
possible<00:07:30.510> to<00:07:30.570> change<00:07:30.690> it's<00:07:31.650> almost<00:07:31.920> like<00:07:32.100> this

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
possible to change it's almost like this

going to stick with the G thirds because
a<00:07:46.380> lot<00:07:46.620> of<00:07:46.740> them<00:07:46.860> do<00:07:47.010> play<00:07:47.250> this<00:07:47.430> I<00:07:47.580> believe<00:07:47.730> 12

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 
a lot of them do play this I believe 12
