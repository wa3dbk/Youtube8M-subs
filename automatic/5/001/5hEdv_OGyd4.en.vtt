00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
get a little bit confused and your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.540 
get a little bit confused and your
muscles<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> work<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> much

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
muscles will have to work that much

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
muscles will have to work that much
harder<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.510> mean<00:00:42.629> they'll<00:00:42.809> work<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
harder which will mean they'll work that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
harder which will mean they'll work that
much<00:00:43.530> stronger<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> change<00:00:45.539> will

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
much stronger and better and change will

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
much stronger and better and change will
happen<00:00:45.780> quicker<00:00:46.320> muscle<00:00:47.280> confusion<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
happen quicker muscle confusion is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
happen quicker muscle confusion is
something<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.390> inside<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.289> kinds<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
something to use inside of all kinds of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
something to use inside of all kinds of
fitness<00:00:50.070> regimes<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> routines<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
fitness regimes and routines so it's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
fitness regimes and routines so it's

try secondly if you're going on to the
Stairmaster<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.399> elliptical<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.180> treadmill

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
Stairmaster the elliptical the treadmill

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
Stairmaster the elliptical the treadmill
you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> buttons<00:01:01.890> surprised<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> have

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you have buttons surprised you have

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
you have buttons surprised you have
speeds<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:04.229> for

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
speeds that can actually be there for

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
speeds that can actually be there for
you<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:05.189> five<00:01:05.790> point<00:01:06.119> OS<00:01:06.240> 6107

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you to see those five point OS 6107

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
you to see those five point OS 6107
point<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.950> time<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> start<00:01:08.700> took<00:01:08.820> taking

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
point it's time you start took taking

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
point it's time you start took taking
yourself<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> new<00:01:10.320> level<00:01:10.799> five<00:01:11.700> point<00:01:11.909> one

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
yourself to a new level five point one

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660 
yourself to a new level five point one
is<00:01:12.270> still<00:01:12.510> faster<00:01:12.780> than<00:01:13.049> five<00:01:13.229> point<00:01:13.530> 0<00:01:13.670> 5.2

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is still faster than five point 0 5.2

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
is still faster than five point 0 5.2
5.3<00:01:14.700> 5.4<00:01:15.509> eventually<00:01:16.409> those<00:01:16.530> points<00:01:17.009> add<00:01:17.159> up

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
5.3 5.4 eventually those points add up

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
5.3 5.4 eventually those points add up
to<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> whole<00:01:18.150> new<00:01:18.360> number<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> six<00:01:19.200> seven

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to a whole new number that is six seven

to a whole new number that is six seven
eight<00:01:20.100> nine<00:01:20.159> ten<00:01:20.700> eleven<00:01:21.240> wherever<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.140> want

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to go with every point one you add up

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
to go with every point one you add up
your<00:01:24.600> containing<00:01:25.140> yourself<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.740> body<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
new place a new level a new you add a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
new place a new level a new you add a
little<00:01:29.970> incline<00:01:30.479> maybe<00:01:31.079> try<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.470> backwards

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
little incline maybe try going backwards

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
little incline maybe try going backwards
on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> treadmill<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.790> these

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
on the treadmill there's all these

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
on the treadmill there's all these
