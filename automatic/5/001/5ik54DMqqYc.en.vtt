00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
a flugelhorn or I'll get up above into F
and<00:02:00.989> G's<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> flugelhorn<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.250> mainly

hover around the staff in the staff the
flute<00:02:06.860> now<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.880> if<00:02:09.119> we're

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
flute now if you're going to do if we're

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.339 
flute now if you're going to do if we're
going<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.630> intervals<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.230> are

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
going to do intervals so here we are

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.250 
going to do intervals so here we are
down<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.720> will<00:02:18.840> put<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
down here then I will do I will put the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.050 
down here then I will do I will put the
flute<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.590> top<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.099> we're<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.340> thirds<00:02:20.760> or

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
flute on top and we're doing thirds or

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
flute on top and we're doing thirds or
sixes<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> things<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.290> let's<00:02:22.710> say

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
sixes and things like that so let's say

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.670 
sixes and things like that so let's say
the<00:02:23.040> chord<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.460> G<00:02:23.490> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the chord is G and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.100 
the chord is G and
here's<00:02:26.310> our<00:02:26.489> flugelhorn<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.659> half<00:02:30.840> note

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
here's our flugelhorn and a half note

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.850 
here's our flugelhorn and a half note
okay

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
okay

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
okay
so<00:02:32.250> here's<00:02:33.950> here's<00:02:34.950> our<00:02:35.720> let's<00:02:36.720> make<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> G

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so here's here's our let's make a G

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
so here's here's our let's make a G
minor<00:02:37.579> so<00:02:38.579> this<00:02:38.610> will<00:02:38.879> be<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> B<00:02:39.239> flat<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
minor so this will be a B flat so to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.030 
minor so this will be a B flat so to
write<00:02:43.109> it<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.349> 1/3<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.370> flute<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.879> play<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:46.040> B

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
write it up 1/3 the flute will play a B

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.580 
write it up 1/3 the flute will play a B
flat<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:48.090> C<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.379> D<00:02:49.799> -<00:02:50.209> uh<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.540> an<00:02:54.659> e<00:02:54.900> because

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
flat to a C to a D - uh to an e because

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.910 
flat to a C to a D - uh to an e because
that<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.189> the<00:02:56.280> key<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.730> G<00:02:57.569> minor<00:02:57.810> okay

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
that is in the key of G minor okay

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.599 
that is in the key of G minor okay
or<00:02:58.980> he<00:02:59.909> could<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.420> E<00:03:00.629> flat<00:03:01.609> depending

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
or he could be an E flat depending

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.270 
or he could be an E flat depending
depends<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.659> what<00:03:03.780> chord<00:03:04.049> follows<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> what

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
depends on what chord follows and what

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
depends on what chord follows and what
else<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.579> happening<00:03:05.819> harmonically<00:03:06.629> we<00:03:06.780> can

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
else is happening harmonically we can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.979 
else is happening harmonically we can
get<00:03:07.019> into<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.349> later<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:07.889> that<00:03:07.950> could<00:03:08.220> be

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
get into that later but that could be

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.539 
get into that later but that could be
depending<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.079> whether<00:03:10.319> we're<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:11.010> we're<00:03:11.189> an<00:03:11.310> F

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
depending on whether we're if we're an F

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.520 
depending on whether we're if we're an F
if<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.909> is<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> two<00:03:12.359> chord<00:03:12.689> an<00:03:12.780> F<00:03:13.019> then<00:03:13.349> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
if this is the two chord an F then that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.160 
if this is the two chord an F then that
would<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:15.859> natural<00:03:16.859> if<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.359> three

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
would be a natural if this was the three

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.229 
would be a natural if this was the three
chord<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.799> E<00:03:20.099> flat<00:03:20.129> and<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:20.730> don't<00:03:20.909> know<00:03:21.060> until

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
chord in E flat and you don't know until

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.759 
chord in E flat and you don't know until
you<00:03:21.420> know<00:03:21.629> what<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.840> chord<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.260> before<00:03:22.620> and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
you know what the chord is before and

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.649 
you know what the chord is before and
after<00:03:23.189> it's<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.459> words<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.879> a<00:03:23.939> conversation

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
after it's like words in a conversation

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.500 
after it's like words in a conversation
then<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.319> would<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.590> e<00:03:25.620> flat<00:03:26.069> but<00:03:26.519> that's<00:03:26.819> for

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
then it would be e flat but that's for

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.449 
then it would be e flat but that's for
future<00:03:28.069> stuff<00:03:29.069> out<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:30.269> ahead<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.139> us

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
future stuff out in the out ahead of us

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.640 
future stuff out in the out ahead of us
so<00:03:33.650> notice<00:03:35.389> so<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.569> that<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.930> an<00:03:37.049> example<00:03:37.379> of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
so notice so that that is an example of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.640 
so notice so that that is an example of
flute<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:39.739> flugelhorn<00:03:42.169> what<00:03:43.169> I<00:03:43.199> want<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> get

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
flute and flugelhorn what I want to get

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.479 
flute and flugelhorn what I want to get
into<00:03:43.970> too<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.299> some<00:03:45.900> passing<00:03:46.590> things<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.400> we

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
into too is some passing things that we

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.409 
into too is some passing things that we
can<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:47.940> we<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.060> play<00:03:48.419> around<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:50.419> there's

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
can that we can play around with there's

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.640 
can that we can play around with there's
there's<00:03:51.840> there's<00:03:52.230> several<00:03:52.500> different

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
there's there's several different

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.180 
there's there's several different
passing<00:03:53.609> chords<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.359> get<00:03:54.510> into<00:03:55.190> and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
passing chords that we can get into and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.099 
passing chords that we can get into and
I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.489> know<00:03:56.699> whether<00:03:56.909> it's<00:03:57.120> too<00:03:57.810> early<00:03:57.840> to

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
I don't know whether it's too early to

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.949 
I don't know whether it's too early to
get<00:03:58.349> into<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.819> want<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.659> we

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
get into all that but I do want to if we

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.990 
get into all that but I do want to if we
were<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.290> let's<00:04:01.590> say<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.769> passing<00:04:02.699> chord

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
were like let's say a passing chord

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.399 
were like let's say a passing chord
would<00:04:03.690> be<00:04:03.750> or<00:04:04.229> a<00:04:04.290> passing<00:04:04.949> note<00:04:05.180> would<00:04:06.180> be<00:04:06.419> if

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
would be or a passing note would be if

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.270 
would be or a passing note would be if
we're<00:04:07.829> in<00:04:08.099> let's<00:04:09.000> say<00:04:09.269> we're<00:04:09.510> an<00:04:09.599> F<00:04:09.900> okay<00:04:10.280> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
we're in let's say we're an F okay and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.099 
we're in let's say we're an F okay and
put<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.430> bar<00:04:11.639> line<00:04:11.819> here<00:04:12.090> let's<00:04:12.299> say<00:04:12.449> the<00:04:12.599> word<00:04:12.780> F

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
put a bar line here let's say the word F

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.069 
put a bar line here let's say the word F
and<00:04:13.470> let's<00:04:14.340> say<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:16.699> flute<00:04:17.699> is<00:04:17.909> playing<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.479> and

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
and let's say the flute is playing a and

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.409 
and let's say the flute is playing a and
so<00:04:19.949> since<00:04:20.220> we're<00:04:20.400> an<00:04:20.519> F<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.909> going<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.239> B

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
so since we're an F it's going to be B

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.290 
so since we're an F it's going to be B
flat<00:04:21.720> right<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.729> C<00:04:24.050> eighth<00:04:25.050> notes<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:26.300> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
flat right and C eighth notes and the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.689 
flat right and C eighth notes and the
flugelhorn<00:04:28.139> is<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> play<00:04:28.889> down<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.400> third

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
flugelhorn is going to play down a third

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.890 
flugelhorn is going to play down a third
so<00:04:29.880> he'll<00:04:30.060> play<00:04:30.270> an<00:04:30.389> F<00:04:30.659> a<00:04:31.280> G<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.550> an<00:04:33.389> A

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
so he'll play an F a G and an A

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.279 
so he'll play an F a G and an A
okay<00:04:34.860> notice<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.940> okay<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:36.539> if<00:04:36.779> our<00:04:36.900> chord<00:04:37.169> is

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
okay notice that okay so if our chord is

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.239 
okay notice that okay so if our chord is
f

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
f

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.479 
f
a<00:04:39.309> and<00:04:40.239> F<00:04:40.869> is<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.499> first<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.219> the<00:04:42.459> third

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:42.489 
a and F is the first and the third

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.999 
a and F is the first and the third
degree<00:04:42.939> of<00:04:43.329> an<00:04:43.539> F<00:04:43.689> triad<00:04:44.169> right<00:04:44.409> and<00:04:44.649> here<00:04:44.889> we

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
degree of an F triad right and here we

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.949 
degree of an F triad right and here we
have<00:04:45.159> a<00:04:45.309> and<00:04:45.729> C<00:04:45.969> and<00:04:45.999> that's<00:04:46.239> a<00:04:46.449> third<00:04:46.689> and

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:46.959 
have a and C and that's a third and

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.419 
have a and C and that's a third and
fifth<00:04:47.289> degree<00:04:47.409> but<00:04:47.679> what<00:04:47.799> about<00:04:48.009> these<00:04:48.159> two

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:48.429 
fifth degree but what about these two

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:50.669 
fifth degree but what about these two
notes<00:04:48.669> they're<00:04:49.509> not<00:04:49.719> an<00:04:49.839> NF<00:04:50.109> drive<00:04:50.349> but

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:50.679 
notes they're not an NF drive but

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.059 
notes they're not an NF drive but
they're<00:04:50.889> in<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.069> key<00:04:51.249> of<00:04:51.279> F<00:04:51.519> and<00:04:52.079> so<00:04:53.079> G<00:04:53.739> and<00:04:54.009> the

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
they're in the key of F and so G and the

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.399 
they're in the key of F and so G and the
key<00:04:54.249> of<00:04:54.279> F<00:04:54.519> is<00:04:54.669> a<00:04:54.729> two<00:04:55.119> is<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.959> second<00:04:56.319> degree

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
key of F is a two is the second degree

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.719 
key of F is a two is the second degree
and<00:04:57.329> jima<00:04:58.329> and<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.719> b-flat<00:04:59.289> so<00:05:00.219> if<00:05:00.339> we<00:05:00.489> were<00:05:00.609> to

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
and jima and the b-flat so if we were to

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.969 
and jima and the b-flat so if we were to
continue<00:05:01.059> this<00:05:01.479> this<00:05:03.239> triad<00:05:04.239> and<00:05:04.649> have<00:05:05.649> a<00:05:05.679> D

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
continue this this triad and have a D

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.969 
continue this this triad and have a D
there<00:05:06.279> what<00:05:06.579> chord<00:05:06.879> is<00:05:06.999> is<00:05:07.359> G<00:05:07.779> oak<00:05:08.019> the<00:05:08.829> egg

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
there what chord is is G oak the egg

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.100 
there what chord is is G oak the egg
timer<00:05:10.709> we<00:05:11.709> have<00:05:11.829> G<00:05:12.099> B<00:05:12.339> flat<00:05:12.369> and<00:05:12.759> D<00:05:12.819> that<00:05:13.569> is<00:05:13.599> a<00:05:13.809> G

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
timer we have G B flat and D that is a G

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.129 
timer we have G B flat and D that is a G
minor<00:05:14.349> chord<00:05:14.679> which<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.099> two<00:05:15.279> chord<00:05:15.639> in<00:05:15.789> F

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
minor chord which is the two chord in F

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.409 
minor chord which is the two chord in F
so<00:05:17.139> if<00:05:17.860> we<00:05:18.219> were<00:05:18.309> in<00:05:18.369> the<00:05:18.489> key<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.669> C<00:05:18.999> our<00:05:19.269> 2

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
so if we were in the key of C our 2

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.209 
so if we were in the key of C our 2
chord<00:05:19.659> would<00:05:19.809> be<00:05:19.869> D<00:05:20.169> minor<00:05:20.499> built<00:05:21.009> off<00:05:21.189> the

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
chord would be D minor built off the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.479 
chord would be D minor built off the
second<00:05:21.669> degree<00:05:21.759> of<00:05:22.119> the<00:05:22.239> scale<00:05:22.749> if<00:05:23.739> our<00:05:24.099> key

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:24.489 
second degree of the scale if our key

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:27.179 
second degree of the scale if our key
was<00:05:24.789> b-flat<00:05:25.569> our<00:05:25.869> second<00:05:26.379> to<00:05:26.469> our<00:05:26.709> 2<00:05:26.979> chord

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
was b-flat our second to our 2 chord

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.429 
was b-flat our second to our 2 chord
would<00:05:27.339> be<00:05:27.459> C<00:05:27.729> minor<00:05:28.029> and<00:05:28.479> so<00:05:29.049> those<00:05:29.259> are<00:05:29.289> the

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
would be C minor and so those are the

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.739 
would be C minor and so those are the
notes<00:05:29.679> that<00:05:29.889> we<00:05:30.009> would<00:05:30.159> use<00:05:30.399> and<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:31.509> will

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:31.749 
notes that we would use and this will

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.819 
notes that we would use and this will
work<00:05:31.839> beautifully<00:05:32.279> because<00:05:34.469> these<00:05:35.469> are<00:05:35.679> all

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:35.829 
work beautifully because these are all

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:37.529 
work beautifully because these are all
these<00:05:36.159> notes<00:05:36.369> are<00:05:36.519> in<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.669> key<00:05:36.849> of<00:05:36.879> F<00:05:37.239> and

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
these notes are in the key of F and

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.479 
these notes are in the key of F and
