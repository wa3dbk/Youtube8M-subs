00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.960
 then it would be hard 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:31.169
 and what we call 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.450
 then different parts and in this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:40.980
 simple, there are different modalities 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 the energy that means 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.320
 as he has left he does not have much division 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.870
 everything is green with photosynthesis 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.480
 that has been left us cut of the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.100
 mother plant but what happens if there's no 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.360
 humidity this withers that power and it 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.090
 move 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.100
 hardwood there are times in species that 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.500
 the change tries to pull and is not able to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.530
 break through the bark or is not able to 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.770
 breaking off the stem is not like very 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 hard 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.200
 so many times what is is what 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.570
 more is what I would be then is a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.729
 classified form in the case of 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.440
 wood normally uses more forms 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.400
 thick and others that dress like those that 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.720
 you have here 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.490
 ok I'm cutting here 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 and I'm crossing the semi-immature area 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.440
 not because the end of the skiff which is what 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.920
 what he's going to do is immature and here 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's still semi- mature 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.930
 but this is a tip system 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.470
 interned in some species 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.440
 we could cut here 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.180
 and this would be more than home noval with a 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.180
 only side we find 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.910
 and then 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.510
 the knife also the truth I do not know if 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.510
 with the bed 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.629
 we have the knife we have an angle 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:41.280
 And it is not like that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.320
 and the knife was a bit here is a 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.320
 little more part 5 degrees and it's vodafone 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.280
 because he felt more 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.510
 blade to the side so that the wide part 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.510
 machaca 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.210
 but these plants 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.710
 and be at the same height then there 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.290
 it does not make much sense simply 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.090
 low there and short horizontally 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
 because he has the possibility of going out 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.110
 our steps 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.260
 so that he does not do it since it is the process 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:32.470
 of squeezing and at the same time the bud of the other 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.700
 side so that it has the leader of the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.700
 package that only one 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.890
 what he is saying makes sense 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.310
 if you see how the water circulated circulates 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.310
 by the center of the branch of the low 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.520
 and giving a dry cut a tongue 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.709
 so it comes to the change so that 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.230
 pass the bark that passes the problem 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.540
 but not good to spend more is a bit 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.750
 less than 50% of the thickness of the branch 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.510
 next is 50% you have the danger of 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.070
 that breaks 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.140
 and we put it here 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.910
 and this is to avoid that then when 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.750
 I put the land here and the bag 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.400
 go back to merge with him then what happens 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.140
 the water keeps going up one percent of the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.640
 branch continues to feed the branch the branch 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.960
 will never die is not like when you do 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.780
 a cutting that you cut in freedom 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.890
 and then you say what you've gone down 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.540
 this side that we have not cut to 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.400
 continue feeding the roots but what 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.160
 that goes down for this tab gets stuck 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.930
 there and it does not get anywhere then 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.710
 this is the change what they do is 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.710
 produce a root 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.650
 and we passed it in this case is quite 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:00.889
 big could be a little closer 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.889
 and the way to do it is to pass it like this 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.500
 and roll it up like we're going to flirt 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.500
 a kind of gigantic cigarettes 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.400
 and we make a knot that can be like 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.220
 child a shoe so that it can be opened 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.139
 easily after without having to cut 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.200
 a branch 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.190
 when he 's talking 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.190
 and we have talked 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.590
 professional that we have this 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.040
 what we have to do is fill in the 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.040
 land 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.949
 this can be wet moss can be 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.249
 land our sand the only thing that 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.400
 need is that it is 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.810
 ips 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.810
 surrounded by you 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.810
 m 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.310
 and we close it tight when we are tight 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.310
 better because if you escape less the water 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.900
 and the only thing we need to do now 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.139
 is to be sure that this land does not 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:32.550
 it dries 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:36.770
 usually us the weeks and if 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.770
 You see that it's drying the top 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.650
 good 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.470
 if very large branches it is good to cut 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.520
 here it is better to cut there precisely 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.800
 that from a sheet to two 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.370
 do a bit between the next root and 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.370
 the leaves 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:15.080
 with the guys it's wonderful and nothing 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.080
 you get a lot of water 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.910
 It is a very good way to produce 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.920
 a simple little one is planted in a while 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.920
 of time in a reduced time frame
