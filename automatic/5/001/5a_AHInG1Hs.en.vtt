00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
Stone Edge mmm did over half but it was

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.600 
Stone Edge mmm did over half but it was
I<00:05:09.740> couldn't<00:05:10.740> take<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.340> energy<00:05:11.760> ball<00:05:12.590> mmm-hmm

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
I couldn't take the energy ball mmm-hmm

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.840

only had my abandoned thing left and I

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.550 
only had my abandoned thing left and I
thought<00:05:18.030> he<00:05:18.180> would<00:05:18.360> switch<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:18.870> out<00:05:18.900> for<00:05:19.350> some

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
thought he would switch you out for some

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.060 
thought he would switch you out for some
reason

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
reason

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.360 
reason
and<00:05:22.370> that's<00:05:23.210> why<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:23.390> went<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.750> excited<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:24.830> it

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
and that's why I went to excited and it

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.300 
and that's why I went to excited and it
doesn't<00:05:25.850> do<00:05:25.970> anything<00:05:26.390> obviously<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.310> so

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
doesn't do anything obviously and so

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.820 
doesn't do anything obviously and so
yeah<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:28.700> was<00:05:28.910> kind<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.180> focus<00:05:29.510> for<00:05:29.540> me<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.110> he

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
yeah it was kind of focus for me and he

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.730 
yeah it was kind of focus for me and he
justs<00:05:31.250> for<00:05:32.150> some<00:05:32.420> reason<00:05:32.870> he<00:05:32.990> switches<00:05:33.290> out<00:05:33.560> we

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
justs for some reason he switches out we

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.920 
justs for some reason he switches out we
could<00:05:33.950> easily<00:05:34.400> kill<00:05:34.580> me<00:05:34.850> with<00:05:35.030> an<00:05:35.300> energy<00:05:35.750> ball

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
