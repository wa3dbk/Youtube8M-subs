 vanesa rodrÃ­guez in a recognized 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.840
 fashion blogger who visits us this 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.510
 tomorrow has destroyed my clothes of 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.080
 today he said that I have dressed like 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.420
 the grill on Saturday the clear shirt 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.150
 I had doubts I really knew 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.990
 but let's talk about it, let's take it out 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.170
 benefit to this healthy criticism this and that 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 I've seen myself on Fridays like that a little 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.210
 because it's summer because it's obvious to use 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.909
 the long-sleeved shirts when the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.059
 summer and because he has also determined 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.850
 which it is casual friday for him for 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.449
 decree-law I'm in your head in my 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.979
 head here we have to see on Friday 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.289
 casual because I once worked in a 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.089
 couple of companies where casual Friday 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.399
 was practiced then I said good because 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.249
 not in Pan-American where the opening and 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.720
 the freedom is total then this one by 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:00.080
 there the thing came 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.840
 to see what is a case to the freddy case 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.870
 casual friday or casual Friday 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.060
 depends on each company there are companies that 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.370
 they allow you to go on jining slaps and live and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.360
 it is not no being supersport working 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.360
 which can be an advertising agency 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.010
 and cross the legs 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.350
 where will happen the same of woman 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.060
 - depends the companies there are companies that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.290
 lets you go in short singing and what do I know 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.600
 me and there are others that are much more 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.060
 rigorous that you vary what is the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 spirit of the case to the frider the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.979
 spirit of casual friday to relax a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.259
 little temperatures in the office and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.180
 that you feel a little more free to go 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.920
 dressed to be is about that but if 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.450
 not to deny such a measure 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
 there are companies in which the casual friday 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 it will be that you can incorporate pants 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.390
 coral color is for example that have 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.830
 been fashionable the cakes that followed 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 the corals to the celestial and that is me 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.979
 and that not necessarily fences with the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 gray trousers with brown trousers or 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.060
 with black pants, but not 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.450
 depend on each company or is there 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.010
 companies and it depends on the clear position a 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.450
 super important secretary of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 management and the general manager of a 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.069
 multinational multinational company she does not 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 will go for more than the code what 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.550
 allow in jeans and vine and now this is 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.140
 web page the blog that you have has 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.150
 also served to jump to the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.280
 consulting and many call him to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.690
 companies so you can tell them more or less 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.130
 to the people how they have to say 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.019
 according to the activities that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.040
 perform has allowed a lot of things 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.250
 the truth that this blog has 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 allowed since I have now something 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.370
 excellent and responds to the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 questions that makes me the people 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.560
 can be on video 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.850
 so it allows me to see people 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.650
 the face that I heard the voice that is 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.350
 super important because they are seven years 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.360
 from the beginning not see my face and see 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.819
 a little photos that are gone 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.980
 incorporating little by little allows me 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.930
 also give that kind of consultancy 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.640
 in consultancies both in companies and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.200
 also go to people's homes and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.200
 help them with your closet 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.900
