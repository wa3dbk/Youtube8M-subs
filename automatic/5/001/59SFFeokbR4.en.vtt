we'll<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.730> try<00:02:42.360> again

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
it doesn't hurt the chicken just like

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.640 
it doesn't hurt the chicken just like

not flinching or struggling around and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
not flinching or struggling around and
jumping<00:03:00.280> around<00:03:00.400> before<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.330> because<00:03:01.659> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
jumping around before was just because I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.490 
jumping around before was just because I
really<00:03:02.500> didn't<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:02.980> her<00:03:03.310> run<00:03:03.610> secured<00:03:04.209> well

really didn't have her run secured well

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.600 
really didn't have her run secured well
so<00:03:05.500> that's<00:03:05.739> how<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:05.980> will<00:03:06.099> look<00:03:06.129> when<00:03:06.459> it's

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
might have asked why we only cutting one

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.960 
might have asked why we only cutting one
wing<00:03:40.989> what<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.739> does<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.099> unbalanced<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
wing what it does is unbalanced the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.420 
wing what it does is unbalanced the
flying<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> bird<00:03:44.079> they<00:03:44.709> can<00:03:44.890> get<00:03:45.040> lift<00:03:45.280> on

flying in the bird they can get lift on
one<00:03:45.640> side<00:03:45.940> only<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.569> they<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.230> can't<00:03:47.530> get

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
one side only so they just can't get

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.309
