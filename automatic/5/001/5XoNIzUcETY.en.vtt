00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.469
 health then it should be thought of to show you 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.049
 how do i liner then how do i do it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.850
 the eyeliner line even though they are 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.680
 sincere it seems to me a video a little 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.960
 wasted more than anything else because I don't have 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 no particular technique here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 I have a secret as well a technique and I do 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.849
 this video because many of you in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 these years they asked me precisely about 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.369
 to show how you liner and I know 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 that despite it is easy for me 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.890
 many girls are very difficult to give 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.590
 she liner because it is just a little 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 complicated because maybe a girl can 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 have the hand that trembles in short for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 many reasons 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.780
 and certainly one of the passages a little more 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.220
 difficult though we say during the trick though 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.090
 what I can tell you and that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.290
 definitely with time with exercise 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.540
 also received you to perfect the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.220
 your technique therefore definitely the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.720
 first advice I give you is precisely 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.610
 the one to practice then maybe 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.070
 put them eyeliner every day 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.630
 take at school or at work but 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 even when you are at home do some 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 try and maybe even make lines up 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.499
 a sheet of lines precisely that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.780
 they simulate let's say the eyeliner line 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.960
 because this definitely helps you 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.909
 that hand I think I can 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.399
 pretty well with liner for the fact 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.829
 I therefore draw the drawings from many 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.310
 years so we probably say that I have 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.109
 the hand trained in quotation marks then 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 It can be to another council 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.490
 I give you and not to pull my eye 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 I recommend it is very important therefore not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.319
 pull the eyelid to spend the line 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 of eyeliner because this favors the 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.680
 appearance of early wrinkles as you know 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.960
 control that an area 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.720
 the skin is very delicate here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.330
 thin and also tends to dry out because 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.280
 therefore there are no sebaceous glands 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.620
 it is very important not to do this 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.590
 movement because really in this 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 way to promote early wrinkles and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.760
 then another advice is also to 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.950
 lard-rooms on a level, for example, I know 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.270
 on a table when you need to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.850
 put lai liner 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.770
 in this way you will be able to be more 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.950
 stop and then you will have the firmest hand 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.920
 and beyond this you can also support 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.790
 the hand and this part here on the cheekbone 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.830
 so on the bone here in this way 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
 finally the last advice I give you is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.920
 that of passing the brush to the edges 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.050
 of the container then in this way 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 so we remove the excess product e 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.340
 so the brush is not very heavy 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.220
 of product and so we do not risk 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.140
 deposit a lot of eyeliner in fact a 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.510
 when we go to put it on 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.130
 eyelid 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.750
 I think I won everything then I wanted 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.730
 tell you that in the tutorial 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.400
 I used this elena that of the pupa 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.280
 it's called glossy eyeliner so a 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.959
 liquid eyeliner with felt tip 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.269
 and I preferred to use the liquid one 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.239
 because in my opinion it is the most difficult one 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.670
 to be applied as opposed to eyeliner 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.090
 in cream or in cell 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.860
 or even 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 the pencil therefore at least in my opinion 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.510
 this is really that a little more 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.209
 difficult to use 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.379
 so nothing with this finished vi 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.360
 I leave the tutorial 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.980
 I hope that in some way it is useful 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.099
 even if I repeat that I do n't know any 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.459
 special technique and we see ourselves in 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.459
 next one 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 then I usually start in the middle 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.260
 then eyelid from the middle of the line 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.540
 upper eyelashes 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:49.069
 so I support myself here simply 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.099
 I go to the outside of the eye and not 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.019
 must come to be immediately perfect 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:59.030
 in the sense that we have to take the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:02.599
 our time to do it the way we want 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.450
 so ok so already present goes 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:11.299
 well then I gradually move towards 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:16.760
 centrally of the eye internal 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:20.560
 small steps is the time you will have then 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.560
 I go to the beginning of the eye 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.379
 check of course also with the other 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:46.279
 eye the way they are equal 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:47.960
 obviously now I concentrate later 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.569
 I can go to retouch if I see that there is 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.990
 need now instead I concentrate on the 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:05:02.360
 most external part of the line I prefer 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:10.210
 first the line so and then we say do 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:19.969
 a small triangle that we render 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:21.259
 just a little thicker you see 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.509
 then you can go to retouch 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.789
 obviously with very light touches 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.289
 because otherwise we ruin everything 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:34.219
 obviously then just pass 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.430
 above the line going slightly above 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:43.210
 if you need to make it more straight 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.210
 let's see how I'm doing 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.009
 or even this also serves for 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:53.680
 fill in any spaces maybe left 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.680
 empty or at least less neriman obscure 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.139
 so let's put some here 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.139
 tip 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.830
 ok and that's it done as you really see 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.780
 simple we have our own line of 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.000
 eyeliner of course if you want you can 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.700
 speak thinner I like it a little 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.050
 honestly, however , you do it more 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.600
 thin does not change anything or 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.650
 just don't go too far 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.650
 very upturned
