00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
really cute so I'm hoping my twists

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.359 
really cute so I'm hoping my twists
weren't<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:43.060> tight<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.380> have

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
like a little bit of a curly fro effect

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.599
