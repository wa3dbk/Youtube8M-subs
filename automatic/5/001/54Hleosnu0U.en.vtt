I was so close to ended up getting a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.330 
I was so close to ended up getting a
perfect<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.530> him<00:02:07.650> there<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:07.980> then<00:02:08.100> he<00:02:08.220> comes

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
perfect on him there and then he comes
