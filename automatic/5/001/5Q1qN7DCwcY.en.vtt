mode<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> lot<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> fun<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
mode I think it's a lot of fun I think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
mode I think it's a lot of fun I think
everyone<00:01:10.770> should<00:01:10.799> play<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.939> least<00:01:12.090> once<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
everyone should play it at least once in

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
everyone should play it at least once in
a<00:01:12.659> lifetime<00:01:13.220> some<00:01:14.220> people<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.640> like

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
a lifetime some people don't really like

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
a lifetime some people don't really like
it<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.380> hidden<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it they think the the hidden is a little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.969 
it they think the the hidden is a little
overpowered<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> thing<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
overpowered that sort of thing but I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
overpowered that sort of thing but I
actually<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.869> overpowered

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
actually think it's not that overpowered

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
actually think it's not that overpowered
seeing<00:01:22.770> how<00:01:24.619> see<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.740> people<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.280> hide

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
seeing how see how people can just hide

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
seeing how see how people can just hide
in<00:01:26.610> corners<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.150> avoid<00:01:27.420> being<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:27.750> step

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in corners and avoid being back step

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
in corners and avoid being back step
because<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> face<00:01:28.979> tab<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> normal

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
because a face tab is gonna be a normal

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.370 
because a face tab is gonna be a normal
head<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.829> kill<00:01:32.869> as<00:01:33.869> quickly

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
head it's not going to kill as quickly

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
head it's not going to kill as quickly
as<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> might<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.189> might<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.360> not

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as you might think it might so it's not

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
as you might think it might so it's not
like<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.110> kill<00:01:37.380> everywhere<00:01:37.890> like

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
like I get one hit kill everywhere like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
like I get one hit kill everywhere like

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
behind it but unfortunately he didn't
realized<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.420> crouch<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:53.670> guess

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
realized that I can crouch and I guess

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.950 
realized that I can crouch and I guess
that<00:01:55.259> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> freaked<00:01:55.710> him<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> little

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that kind of freaked him out a little

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
that kind of freaked him out a little
and<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.280> i'm<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.450> stalk<00:02:00.930> i<00:02:01.310> use<00:02:02.310> my

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and so now i'm just gonna stalk i use my

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.789 
and so now i'm just gonna stalk i use my
boo<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.509> basically<00:02:04.049> scares<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
boo which basically scares them it's
like<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> Sun<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.180> actually<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
like I think the Sun is actually a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229 
like I think the Sun is actually a
little<00:02:06.689> too<00:02:06.840> long<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.520> obviously<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:09.060> wasn't

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
little too long but obviously it wasn't

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.380 
little too long but obviously it wasn't
