music<00:02:18.350> often<00:02:19.350> people<00:02:19.730> mean<00:02:20.730> something<00:02:21.090> like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
music often people mean something like

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.430 
music often people mean something like
hillbilly<00:02:21.750> music<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.950> Appalachian<00:02:23.910> music

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
hillbilly music or or Appalachian music

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.979 
hillbilly music or or Appalachian music
but<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> wider<00:02:26.820> sense<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> term

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
but I I like a wider sense of the term

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.280 
but I I like a wider sense of the term
because<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:30.269> what<00:02:30.450> Hank<00:02:30.660> Bradley<00:02:31.079> calls

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because it's what Hank Bradley calls

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
because it's what Hank Bradley calls
village<00:02:31.799> music<00:02:32.250> there's<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.269> something

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
village music there's just something

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.080 
village music there's just something
very<00:02:33.870> likable<00:02:34.470> about<00:02:34.709> old-time<00:02:35.310> music<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
very likable about old-time music and I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.449 
very likable about old-time music and I
think<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.480> maybe<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.290> these<00:02:37.530> melodies

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
think it maybe is because these melodies

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.319 
think it maybe is because these melodies
are<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.329> old<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.670> they've<00:02:41.880> been<00:02:42.060> played

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
are so old that and they've been played

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.560 
are so old that and they've been played

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
of pre radio music the music is like a

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.390
