00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.090
 mexico lately several media have 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.760
 talked about the appearance of a mermaid in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.100
 the state of veracruz in mexico while 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.980
 that other media have used the same 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.870
 image to say that it was found in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.120
 Belgium 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.170
 this time I decided to make a video 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.390
 short 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 explaining the event due to the great 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.020
 number of emails I received 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.540
 about this 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.490
 let me tell you that it is regrettable 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.190
 misinformation by the media 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.460
 when publishing this type of information 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.790
 false just to sell 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.890
 these sirens that we see here belong to 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.860
 the production of the movie Pirates of the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.870
 Caribbean in mysterious tides ' and are 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.299
 simply props 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.299
 [Music] 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.449
 the mermaids were created by joel 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.659
 harlow a makeup artist and 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.030
 special effects due to rights 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.280
 of author I can not publish the video of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.930
 how they were created but in the description 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 I leave the link 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.110
 in conclusion the sirens found in 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.360
 Mexico and war are false and belong 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 to the production of the pirates movie 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.340
 of the Caribbean in mysterious tides' 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:02:04.269
