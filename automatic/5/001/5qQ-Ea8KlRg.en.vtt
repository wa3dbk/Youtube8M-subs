00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.080 

we<00:00:30.310> built<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.610> system<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:31.030> would

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
we built a system that would

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.400 
we built a system that would
automatically<00:00:32.250> transfer<00:00:33.300> dailies<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.690> and

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
automatically transfer dailies and and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.670 
automatically transfer dailies and and
plates<00:00:35.739> in<00:00:36.280> full<00:00:36.460> resolution<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.989> our<00:00:38.140> system

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
plates in full resolution to our system

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.590 
plates in full resolution to our system
rename<00:00:39.130> it<00:00:39.370> based<00:00:39.730> on<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.910> grid<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.090> X<00:00:40.300> naming

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
rename it based on a grid of X naming

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.940 
rename it based on a grid of X naming
conventions<00:00:41.080> and<00:00:41.230> then<00:00:41.350> send<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.710> out<00:00:41.830> to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
conventions and then send it out to

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.160 
conventions and then send it out to
other<00:00:42.190> vendors<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.150> on<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.510> so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
other vendors and so on and so

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.660 
other vendors and so on and so
everything<00:00:44.710> came<00:00:44.890> through<00:00:45.100> us<00:00:45.250> through<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.489> hub

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
everything came through us through a hub

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670 
everything came through us through a hub
we<00:00:45.790> would<00:00:45.940> see<00:00:46.120> everything<00:00:46.410> roll<00:00:47.410> out<00:00:47.559> as<00:00:47.650> a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
we would see everything roll out as a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680 
we would see everything roll out as a
director<00:00:48.040> was<00:00:48.190> there<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:49.180> we<00:00:49.330> would<00:00:49.449> approve

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
director was there that we would approve

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.840 
director was there that we would approve
everything<00:00:49.989> there<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.800> then<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.550> level<00:00:51.699> of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
everything there and then the level of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.119 
everything there and then the level of
interaction<00:00:52.750> was<00:00:52.989> really<00:00:53.230> dependent<00:00:53.980> on

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
interaction was really dependent on

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.549 
interaction was really dependent on
where<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.120> houses<00:00:55.360> were<00:00:55.420> located<00:00:55.840> for

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
where the houses were located for

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.020 
where the houses were located for
instance<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:57.070> know<00:00:57.100> with<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.699> many<00:00:57.730> image

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
instance you know with so many image

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.540 
instance you know with so many image
works<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.510> digital<00:00:58.720> domain<00:00:58.979> and<00:00:59.979> hydraulics

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
works and digital domain and hydraulics

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.979 
works and digital domain and hydraulics
and<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:00.970> since<00:01:01.180> they<00:01:01.330> were<00:01:01.449> all<00:01:01.629> local

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
and so on since they were all local

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.119 
and so on since they were all local
where<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.500> know<00:01:02.559> very<00:01:02.890> close

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
where the you know very close

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.910 
where the you know very close
relationship<00:01:03.699> we<00:01:03.909> would<00:01:04.059> go<00:01:04.629> over<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.199> and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
relationship we would go over and and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.660 
relationship we would go over and and
visit<00:01:06.340> them<00:01:06.520> sometimes<00:01:08.130> scanline<00:01:09.130> pixel<00:01:09.490> mono

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
visit them sometimes scanline pixel mono

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.969 
visit them sometimes scanline pixel mono
le<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.540> had<00:01:10.930> or<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.380> had<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> guys<00:01:11.710> come

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
le and we had or we had the guys come

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.320 
le and we had or we had the guys come
over<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.340> sit<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.580> our<00:01:12.670> screening<00:01:13.060> room<00:01:13.240> who

looked at stuff together sometimes it

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.590 
looked at stuff together sometimes it
was<00:01:15.250> like<00:01:15.280> almost<00:01:15.729> like<00:01:16.030> spur<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.570> moment

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
here in 15 minutes so it's the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.480 
here in 15 minutes so it's the
apocalypse<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.810> up<00:01:26.530> days

the Judgment Day the end of the world my
friend<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:31.450> mean<00:01:31.990> that's<00:01:32.109> usually<00:01:32.380> usually

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829

quote<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.520> two<00:01:34.210> different<00:01:34.630> sequences<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:35.140> think

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
quote to two different sequences I think

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.099 
quote to two different sequences I think
I<00:01:35.350> mean<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:35.740> was<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.090> water<00:01:37.359> of<00:01:37.570> masses

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
I mean one was the the water of masses

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.929 
I mean one was the the water of masses
rushing<00:01:38.799> through<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.100> Himalayan<00:01:39.549> mountains

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
rushing through the Himalayan mountains

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.749 
rushing through the Himalayan mountains
because<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.299> have<00:01:40.649> enormous<00:01:41.649> scale<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.399> water

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
because you have enormous scale in water

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.330 
because you have enormous scale in water
and<00:01:43.179> scan-line<00:01:44.140> handled<00:01:44.859> that<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.250> was

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
and scan-line handled that and it was

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.410 
and scan-line handled that and it was
the<00:01:45.460> belief<00:01:45.609> that<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.299> their

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
the belief that because of their

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.730 
the belief that because of their
proprietor<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.020> system<00:01:47.350> they<00:01:47.469> were<00:01:47.560> probably

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
proprietor the system they were probably

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.679 
proprietor the system they were probably
the<00:01:47.890> only<00:01:48.100> ones<00:01:48.250> who<00:01:48.369> could<00:01:48.579> pull<00:01:48.850> pull<00:01:49.539> that

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
the only ones who could pull pull that

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.139 
the only ones who could pull pull that
off<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.259> such<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> short<00:01:51.039> time<00:01:51.159> with<00:01:51.759> such<00:01:51.880> a

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
off in such a short time with such a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.480 
off in such a short time with such a
fast<00:01:52.420> turnaround<00:01:53.020> yeah<00:01:53.859> and<00:01:54.100> we're<00:01:54.250> from<00:01:54.429> the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
get-go you know that this once you start

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.130 
get-go you know that this once you start
discussing<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:57.280> like<00:01:57.460> worldwide<00:01:58.060> two<00:01:58.899> or

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
discussing this like worldwide two or

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.929 
discussing this like worldwide two or
three<00:01:59.380> companies<00:01:59.829> that<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.460> know<00:02:00.549> could

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
three companies that you know could

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.060 
three companies that you know could
handle<00:02:01.299> something<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.799> then<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
handle something like that and then the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.459 
handle something like that and then the
second<00:02:03.369> one<00:02:03.520> was<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.210> Le<00:02:04.299> earthquake<00:02:04.960> which

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
second one was the Le earthquake which

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.080 
second one was the Le earthquake which
is<00:02:05.590> really<00:02:05.770> split<00:02:06.009> into<00:02:06.159> two<00:02:06.369> parts<00:02:06.670> one<00:02:06.880> was

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
is really split into two parts one was

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.730 
is really split into two parts one was
an<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.329> our<00:02:07.450> sequence<00:02:07.810> where<00:02:08.200> we'd<00:02:08.380> write<00:02:08.560> with

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
an in our sequence where we'd write with

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.350 
an in our sequence where we'd write with
a<00:02:08.770> limousine<00:02:09.070> through<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.759> earthquake<00:02:10.179> as

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
in the movie so what's very organic we

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.190 
in the movie so what's very organic we
worked<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:06.380> Roland<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.910> mean<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.600> really<00:03:08.960> why

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
worked with Roland I mean not really why

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.890 
worked with Roland I mean not really why
we<00:03:09.440> were<00:03:09.590> making<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.790> CG<00:03:11.150> shots<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.510> very

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
we were making the CG shots but very

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.400 
we were making the CG shots but very
early<00:03:12.310> before<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.580> started<00:03:14.120> why<00:03:15.050> we<00:03:15.290> were

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
early before we started why we were

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.650 
early before we started why we were
doing<00:03:15.440> pre-visualization<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.210> this

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
doing pre-visualization on it and this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.190 
doing pre-visualization on it and this
became<00:03:17.960> a<00:03:18.430> previous<00:03:19.430> sequence<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
became a previous sequence that was so

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.310 
became a previous sequence that was so
minut<00:03:21.830> in<00:03:22.160> detail<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.690> play<00:03:23.960> it<00:03:24.140> side

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
minut in detail that if you play it side

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.260 
minut in detail that if you play it side
by<00:03:24.500> side<00:03:24.770> with<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.370> actual<00:03:25.640> film<00:03:25.880> now<00:03:26.090> it's<00:03:26.210> in

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
by side with the actual film now it's in

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.900 
by side with the actual film now it's in
95<00:03:26.690> percent<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.200> same<00:03:27.490> so<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.580> also<00:03:28.730> have<00:03:28.880> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
95 percent the same so you also have a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.930 
95 percent the same so you also have a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
so much fun more fun than looking at a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.290 
so much fun more fun than looking at a
computer<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.310> waiting<00:03:53.550> for<00:03:53.670> five<00:03:53.850> hours<00:03:54.180> to

have<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.480> sim<00:03:54.690> done<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.320> goes<00:03:55.470> like

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
have a sim done and then it goes like

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.210 
have a sim done and then it goes like
this<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.600> fact<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.170> though<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.800> much<00:03:58.980> fun

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220

as<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.520> is<00:03:59.700> there's<00:04:00.180> two<00:04:00.390> different

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
as that is there's two different

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.540 
as that is there's two different
problems<00:04:00.780> with<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.290> one<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.710> physical

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
problems with the one is physical

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.480 
problems with the one is physical
limitations<00:04:03.090> we're<00:04:04.020> obviously<00:04:04.740> in<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.280> movie

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490

falls<00:04:40.050> well<00:04:41.060> sorry<00:04:42.060> that's<00:04:42.210> how<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.780> is<00:04:42.930> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
falls well sorry that's how it is you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.170 
falls well sorry that's how it is you
know<00:04:43.470> with<00:04:43.590> CG<00:04:43.920> you<00:04:44.070> can<00:04:44.280> totally<00:04:44.640> change<00:04:44.880> that

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
know with CG you can totally change that

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.450 
know with CG you can totally change that
and<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.750> second<00:04:46.080> thing<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.460> budgetary

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
and the second thing is budgetary

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.280 
and the second thing is budgetary
limitations<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.480> sounds<00:04:48.780> weird<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.169> it

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
limitations and that sounds weird on it

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.860 
limitations and that sounds weird on it
on<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.410> big<00:04:49.650> movie<00:04:49.919> like<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.280> but<00:04:50.580> if<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.630> have

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
on a big movie like this but if you have

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.350 
on a big movie like this but if you have
a<00:04:51.900> scene<00:04:52.290> where<00:04:52.620> literally<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.310> entire<00:04:53.400> Los

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
a scene where literally the entire Los

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.200 
a scene where literally the entire Los
Angeles<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.140> obviously<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:56.250> know<00:04:56.280> part<00:04:57.090> of

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
Angeles and obviously you know part of

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.940 
Angeles and obviously you know part of
it<00:04:57.360> would<00:04:57.510> still<00:04:57.720> always<00:04:57.930> be<00:04:58.050> met<00:04:58.440> painting<00:04:58.860> or

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
it would still always be met painting or

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.550 
it would still always be met painting or
whatever<00:04:59.250> but<00:04:59.750> even<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:00.900> even<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.380> stuff

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
whatever but even that even the stuff

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.590 
whatever but even that even the stuff
that's<00:05:01.710> closed<00:05:01.950> is<00:05:02.250> an<00:05:02.880> entire<00:05:03.180> residential

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
that's closed is an entire residential

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.510 
that's closed is an entire residential
neighborhood<00:05:04.140> an<00:05:04.380> entire<00:05:04.680> commercial<00:05:05.250> street

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
neighborhood an entire commercial street

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.130 
neighborhood an entire commercial street
like<00:05:05.820> Wilshire<00:05:06.180> Boulevard<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:06.960> and

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
like Wilshire Boulevard and so on and

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.870 
like Wilshire Boulevard and so on and
then<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.500> entire<00:05:07.770> downtown<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.370> Los<00:05:08.550> Angeles

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
then the entire downtown of Los Angeles

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.360 
then the entire downtown of Los Angeles
if<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.720> had<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.050> build<00:05:10.290> all<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:11.040> as

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
if you had to build all this as

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.150 
if you had to build all this as
miniature<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.210> make<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.140> crumble<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.710> shoot

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
miniature and make it crumble and shoot

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.130 
miniature and make it crumble and shoot
it<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.880> would<00:05:15.180> become<00:05:15.480> outrageously

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
it it would become outrageously

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.720 
it it would become outrageously
expensive<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:16.620> absolutely<00:05:17.070> not<00:05:17.220> possible<00:05:17.250> to

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
expensive but absolutely not possible to

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.690 
expensive but absolutely not possible to
do<00:05:17.850> just<00:05:18.390> for<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.570> one-shot<00:05:19.280> was<00:05:20.280> always<00:05:20.550> my

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
do just for the one-shot was always my

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.370 
do just for the one-shot was always my
favorite<00:05:21.240> example<00:05:21.600> is<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:22.080> limb<00:05:22.230> was

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
favorite example is that the limb was

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.290 
favorite example is that the limb was
driving<00:05:22.710> away<00:05:22.800> from<00:05:23.070> us<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.850> residential

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
driving away from us in a residential

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.880 
driving away from us in a residential
neighborhood<00:05:24.480> it's<00:05:25.230> also<00:05:25.380> there<00:05:25.650> in<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
neighborhood it's also there in the

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.200 
neighborhood it's also there in the
trailer<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> very<00:05:26.520> quick<00:05:26.730> cut<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.120> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
trailer it's a very quick cut in the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.250 
trailer it's a very quick cut in the
trailer<00:05:27.540> though<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:28.160> it's<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:30.090> much<00:05:30.900> stuff

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
trailer though and it's so much stuff

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.990 
trailer though and it's so much stuff
going<00:05:31.590> on<00:05:31.860> at<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.310> same<00:05:32.490> time<00:05:32.640> just<00:05:32.669> the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
going on at the same time just the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.230 
going on at the same time just the
logistics<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.810> all<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:35.370> look<00:05:35.610> for<00:05:35.940> a

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
logistics of all of that to look for a

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.810 
logistics of all of that to look for a
mile<00:05:36.750> into<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.260> distance<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.220> see<00:05:38.520> things

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
mile into the distance and see things

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.290 
mile into the distance and see things
shaking<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.500> crumbling<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.210> on

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
shaking and and and crumbling and so on

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.210 
shaking and and and crumbling and so on
I<00:05:42.330> mean<00:05:42.510> just<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.870> rig<00:05:43.230> that<00:05:43.260> even<00:05:43.800> if<00:05:43.919> you

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
I mean just to rig that even if you

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.260 
I mean just to rig that even if you
would<00:05:44.340> want<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.640> shoot<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:44.850> as<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.030> miniature

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
would want to shoot that as a miniature

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.850 
would want to shoot that as a miniature
you<00:05:45.480> would<00:05:45.600> have<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:45.840> do<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.230> like<00:05:46.260> so<00:05:46.590> many

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
you would have to do it and like so many

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.710 
you would have to do it and like so many
parts<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.430> later<00:05:47.700> composite<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.360> together

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
parts to later composite it together

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.020 
parts to later composite it together
because<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.620> triggering<00:05:50.070> off<00:05:50.370> let's<00:05:50.910> say

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
because the triggering off let's say

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.060 
because the triggering off let's say
like<00:05:51.150> five<00:05:51.450> hundred<00:05:51.720> events<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.650> all<00:05:52.860> have

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
like five hundred events that all have

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.870 
like five hundred events that all have
to<00:05:53.100> work<00:05:53.430> 100%<00:05:53.970> pretty<00:05:54.750> much
