00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.940 
audience and especially if you can't see
them<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:45.420> bright<00:01:45.720> lights<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
them because there's bright lights you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.030 
them because there's bright lights you
know<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.430> four<00:01:48.030> quadrants<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.500> spend

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
know there's four quadrants so spend

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.179 
know there's four quadrants so spend
about<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> fourth

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
about that much time in the fourth

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
about that much time in the fourth
different<00:01:53.189> quadrant<00:01:53.880> people<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
different quadrant people are going to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
different quadrant people are going to
think<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.380> looking<00:01:55.530> right<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.280> them

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
think that you're looking right at them

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840 
think that you're looking right at them
so<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.079> important<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> spend<00:01:59.219> four<00:01:59.820> or

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
