00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
that has no tag in it and you need to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.850 
that has no tag in it and you need to
know<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:09.030> size<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
know what size it is so we're going to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.999 
know what size it is so we're going to
take<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> tape<00:00:12.090> measure<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.769> I'll<00:00:13.769> show<00:00:13.950> you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
take a tape measure and I'll show you

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.630 
take a tape measure and I'll show you
exactly<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.279> want<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
exactly how to do that so you want to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
exactly how to do that so you want to
work<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> hard<00:00:18.449> flat<00:00:18.840> surface<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> case

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
work on a hard flat surface in this case

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.679 
work on a hard flat surface in this case
I'm<00:00:20.220> using<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.580> bed<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.210> best<00:00:21.570> choice

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
I'm using my bed not the best choice

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.990 
I'm using my bed not the best choice
probably<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.740> table<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.400> floor<00:00:23.580> would<00:00:23.789> work<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
probably a table or floor would work a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
probably a table or floor would work a
lot<00:00:24.090> better<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.260> flatten<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> jacket

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
lot better but just flatten the jacket

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
lot better but just flatten the jacket
out<00:00:26.250> make<00:00:26.490> sure<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.760> wrinkles<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
out make sure the wrinkles are out and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
out make sure the wrinkles are out and
but<00:00:28.680> make<00:00:28.830> sure<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> don't<00:00:29.189> stretch<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
but make sure you don't stretch it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.339 
but make sure you don't stretch it
enough<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> jacket<00:00:30.929> starts<00:00:31.170> opening

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
enough where the jacket starts opening

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130 
enough where the jacket starts opening
up<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.730> enough<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.480> flat<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
up just enough so that it's flat you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.920 
up just enough so that it's flat you
want<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> measure<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.250> armpit<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.300> armpit<00:00:36.329> in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
want to measure from armpit to armpit in

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
want to measure from armpit to armpit in
this<00:00:37.559> case<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> jackets<00:00:38.460> twenty-one<00:00:39.120> inches

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this case the jackets twenty-one inches

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
this case the jackets twenty-one inches
so<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.469> times<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
so you want to times that by two and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
so you want to times that by two and
that<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.079> chest<00:00:43.350> size<00:00:43.530> which

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that will get you your chest size which

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.940 
that will get you your chest size which
is<00:00:44.010> 42<00:00:44.370> inches<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.770> other

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is 42 inches and the only other

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
is 42 inches and the only other
measurement<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> want<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
measurement you want to see is the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.100 
measurement you want to see is the
length<00:00:49.640> just<00:00:50.640> under<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> collar<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.870> you're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
length just under the collar here you're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.299 
length just under the collar here you're
supposed<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> do

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
supposed to do from the back but I do

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
supposed to do from the back but I do
from<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> front<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.149> easier<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.500> just

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
from the front it's just easier so just

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
from the front it's just easier so just
below<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> collar<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> end<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
below the collar down to the end this

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
below the collar down to the end this
jacket<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> 31<00:00:59.219> inches<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.690> to

to<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.150> favorites<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:22.100> my<00:01:23.100> chest<00:01:23.939> on

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to your favorites and so my chest on

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.800 
to your favorites and so my chest on
that<00:01:25.020> blazer<00:01:25.290> measured<00:01:27.049> 21<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that blazer measured 21 so that would be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.490 
that blazer measured 21 so that would be
a<00:01:31.140> 42<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.030> 40<00:01:33.960> regular

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a 42 so that is a 40 regular

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.370 
a 42 so that is a 40 regular
actually<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> shouldn't<00:01:35.970> say<00:01:36.030> regular<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually I shouldn't say regular the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
actually I shouldn't say regular the
length<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:38.340> 31<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.040> scenario<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
length was 31 so in this scenario it is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.310 
length was 31 so in this scenario it is
a<00:01:42.450> 40<00:01:42.930> regular

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
a 40 regular

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
a 40 regular
now<00:01:44.100> usually<00:01:44.490> suit<00:01:45.360> jackets<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:46.759> around<00:01:47.759> 31

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
now usually suit jackets are around 31

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
now usually suit jackets are around 31
inches<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.020> 32<00:01:49.470> inches<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.920> length

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
inches to 32 inches in length

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.289 
inches to 32 inches in length
if<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.479> find<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> 33<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.189> 34<00:01:53.700> that's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
if if you find it is a 33 or 34 that's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.910 
if if you find it is a 33 or 34 that's
going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> long<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> case<00:01:55.770> I'd

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
going to be a long so in that case I'd

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.350 
going to be a long so in that case I'd
be<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.270> 40l<00:01:57.299> but
