the butter eventually it'll turn to a
nice<00:00:42.360> breadcrumb<00:00:42.899> consistency<00:00:43.739> next<00:00:44.430> we'll

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
nice breadcrumb consistency next we'll

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
nice breadcrumb consistency next we'll
assemble<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> crumble<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.809> bake<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
assemble the crumble and then we bake it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
assemble the crumble and then we bake it
in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> oven<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> fruits<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> bottom

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the oven so the fruits in the bottom

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
in the oven so the fruits in the bottom
of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> mold<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of the mold you could do this in a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.100 
of the mold you could do this in a
transport<00:00:50.570> ice<00:00:51.570> layer<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> crumble<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.410> top

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
transport ice layer the crumble on top

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
transport ice layer the crumble on top
so<00:00:55.110> bake<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> crumbles<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.039> young<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.550> about

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so bake the crumbles in young for about

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.290 
so bake the crumbles in young for about
25<00:00:57.149> minutes<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.260> top<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.500> golden<00:00:58.800> brown

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
25 minutes so the top is golden brown

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.670 
25 minutes so the top is golden brown
whilst<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> crumbles<00:01:00.750> cooking<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.530> make

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
whilst the crumbles cooking will make

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
whilst the crumbles cooking will make
the<00:01:01.770> custard<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:03.899> milk<00:01:04.110> bring<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the custard so we got milk bring that to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370 
the custard so we got milk bring that to
the<00:01:04.920> boil<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:05.970> vanilla<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.140> straight

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.700 

at<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> cornflower<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> milk<00:01:28.470> comes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
at the cornflower so once the milk comes

at the cornflower so once the milk comes
to<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> boil<00:01:29.100> we've<00:01:29.910> gone<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.330> egg<00:01:30.450> yolks

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
to the boil we've gone to the egg yolks

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.650 
to the boil we've gone to the egg yolks
sugar<00:01:30.960> flour<00:01:31.620> just<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.980> dissolve<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.520> sugar

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.300 

and<00:01:36.660> we<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.050> into<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.410> pan<00:01:37.620> back

and we get it back into the pan back

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.910 
and we get it back into the pan back
onto<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> heat<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.620> we're<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.830> to

flour<00:01:43.710> cooks<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.370> custards<00:01:44.730> will<00:01:44.880> take<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
flour cooks the custards will take it

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.330 
flour cooks the custards will take it
you'll<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.530> boils<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.010> will<00:01:47.130> thicken

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you'll see as it boils it will thicken

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.140 
you'll see as it boils it will thicken
quite<00:01:47.760> substantially<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.850> add<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> little

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
quite substantially just add a little

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.140 
quite substantially just add a little
touch<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.750> double<00:01:52.140> cream<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.940> thin<00:01:54.120> it

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
touch of double cream just to thin it

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.120 
touch of double cream just to thin it
down<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> once<00:01:55.470> they're<00:01:55.590> out<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> oven

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
down so once they're out in the oven

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
down so once they're out in the oven
that's<00:01:56.370> what<00:01:56.490> they'll<00:01:56.610> look<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.790> finished

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that's what they'll look like finished

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's what they'll look like finished
with<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> dusting<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> icing<00:01:58.410> sugar<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.760> the

with a dusting of icing sugar and the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.840 
with a dusting of icing sugar and the
custard<00:02:03.120> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> side<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:05.190> there<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.370> have<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
custard on the side so there you have a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.520 
custard on the side so there you have a
rhubarb<00:02:06.750> crumble<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.680> vanilla<00:02:07.920> custard
