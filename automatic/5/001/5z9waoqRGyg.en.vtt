adjust<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.510> brightness<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
adjust the brightness on this and the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.289 
adjust the brightness on this and the
contrast<00:01:05.369> we'll<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.700> ahead<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.909> push<00:01:06.090> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
contrast we'll go ahead and push this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.719 
contrast we'll go ahead and push this
and<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.869> bit<00:01:07.049> brighter<00:01:07.260> maybe

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
and make a little bit brighter maybe

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.340 
and make a little bit brighter maybe
just<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> shows<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> camera<00:01:09.990> more

ball<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.150> let's<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> ahead<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
ball so let's go ahead and put it up in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
ball so let's go ahead and put it up in
Park<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.619> shut<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.790> let's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
Park and shut this thing off and let's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
Park and shut this thing off and let's
go<00:01:33.060> back<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.619> where

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
go back and see if we can see where

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.510 
go back and see if we can see where
we're<00:01:35.100> at

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.719 

yeah<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.240> can<00:01:41.540> see<00:01:41.780> my<00:01:42.560> ball<00:01:43.220> would<00:01:43.460> have<00:01:43.549> been

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
yeah you can see my ball would have been

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.160 
yeah you can see my ball would have been
here<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.270> probably<00:01:44.479> would<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:44.840> seen<00:01:45.020> it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
here and I probably would have seen it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.380 
here and I probably would have seen it
out<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.470> camera<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:45.979> some<00:01:46.159> extent<00:01:46.640> because

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
out of the camera to some extent because

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.359 
out of the camera to some extent because
it<00:01:47.509> goes<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.930> hitch<00:01:48.079> down<00:01:48.380> here<00:01:48.680> but

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
it goes in the hitch down here but

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.130 
it goes in the hitch down here but
here's<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.700> camera<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.659> I've<00:01:50.780> got<00:01:50.990> it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
here's the camera and I've got it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.960 
here's the camera and I've got it
mounted<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:52.280> comes<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.790> these

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
mounted and it comes with these

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.539 
mounted and it comes with these
adjustable<00:01:53.840> screws<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.590> are<00:01:54.710> up<00:01:54.860> top<00:01:55.130> there

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
adjustable screws that are up top there

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.580 
adjustable screws that are up top there
are<00:01:55.640> these<00:01:55.759> adjustable<00:01:56.240> washers<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.049> you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
are these adjustable washers and you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.350 
are these adjustable washers and you
basically<00:01:57.979> turn<00:01:58.340> them<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.670> get<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.939> angle

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
basically turn them to get the angle

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.330 
basically turn them to get the angle
that<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.630> want<00:01:59.659> then<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.289> run<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.799> wire<00:02:00.979> inside

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that you want then I run the wire inside

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.550 
that you want then I run the wire inside
I<00:02:01.580> didn't<00:02:02.000> have<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:02.929> decided

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
I didn't have to do this I just decided

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.070 
I didn't have to do this I just decided
to<00:02:03.679> do<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.280> my<00:02:04.460> own<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:05.570> run<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.869> wire

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
to do that on my own to run the wire

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.050 
to do that on my own to run the wire
through<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.810> fitting<00:02:09.229> there<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.000> see<00:02:11.000> if

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
through the the fitting there and see if

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.090 
through the the fitting there and see if
I<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.330> open<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.019> then<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.500> mounted<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
I can open this and then I mounted the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.370 
I can open this and then I mounted the
controller<00:02:13.580> underneath<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.200> can

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
controller underneath here and you can

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.280 
controller underneath here and you can
see<00:02:16.000> amongst<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.299> these<00:02:17.450> other<00:02:17.660> things<00:02:18.140> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
see amongst all these other things that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.699 
see amongst all these other things that
I<00:02:18.440> got<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.910> that's<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.110> sender<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
I got here that's the the sender that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.600 
I got here that's the the sender that
sends<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.459> signal<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:24.430> unit<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.549> we

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
sends the signal up to the unit that we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.789 
sends the signal up to the unit that we
were<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.030> looking<00:02:26.269> at<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> cab<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.500> it's

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
were just looking at in the cab and it's

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.710 
were just looking at in the cab and it's
real<00:02:27.980> simple<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.819> wires<00:02:29.030> into<00:02:29.330> one<00:02:29.630> of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
real simple to do it wires into one of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.809 
real simple to do it wires into one of
your<00:02:29.810> backup<00:02:30.200> lights<00:02:30.470> which<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.580> case

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
your backup lights which in this case

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.789 
your backup lights which in this case
you<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.060> take<00:02:32.810> out<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.019> couple<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.410> screws

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
you just take out a couple of screws

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.380 
you just take out a couple of screws
that<00:02:34.130> are<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.549> taillight<00:02:34.940> pull<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.239> tail

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
that are on the taillight pull the tail

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.370 
that are on the taillight pull the tail
light<00:02:35.569> out<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.959> gives<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> little

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
light out and that gives you a little

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.800 
light out and that gives you a little
splice<00:02:36.799> connector<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> scotch<00:02:37.819> guard<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.510> scotch

lock that will allow you to pinch that

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.530 
lock that will allow you to pinch that
on<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.489> again<00:02:43.489> whenever<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.180> put<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
on and again whenever you put it in

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.060 
on and again whenever you put it in
reverse<00:02:44.630> then<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.230> turns<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.739> power<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
reverse then it turns on the power to
