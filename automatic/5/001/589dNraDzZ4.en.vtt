computer for the animus and it was to
point<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.399> computer<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.000> connects<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
point out the computer it connects to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.819 
point out the computer it connects to
the<00:01:51.899> back<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:54.110> yeah<00:01:55.110> got

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the back if you can see it yeah got

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.060 
the back if you can see it yeah got
connected<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.110> cuz<00:01:58.829> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
connected to their and then this cuz in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
connected to their and then this cuz in
the<00:01:59.159> picture<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.880> something<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the picture there was something that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020 
the picture there was something that
like<00:02:00.649> visualizes<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.680> memory<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.369> like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
like visualizes the memory for like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.050 
like visualizes the memory for like
Desmond<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:05.399> what<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> would<00:02:05.880> do

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Desmond this is it so what you would do

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.610 
Desmond this is it so what you would do
is<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.829> for<00:02:07.829> example
