00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.599
 after the mad success of episode 4 george 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.250
 lukas was finally able to dictate his 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.500
 conditions for seconds decided no longer 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.270
 contact financially with the studio to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 I didn't have to change anything in the movie 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.390
 not at will 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 he decided that he would go against the rules and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.559
 financed the film himself and also decided 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.720
 relax and hired by director irvina 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.300
 Kirschner himself remained at the same time as 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.339
 counselor inspirer and producer 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.379

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.890
 correctly to keep undermined 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.900
 the last part of health for special effects 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.760
 decree took the same team that already 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.250
 gained experience and still effects 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 were based on layouts and google by the way 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.729
 to remove the chase in the meteorite field 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.650
 effects specialists used in 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.450
 as meteorites usual potatoes 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.910
 in this wrote a new hero appears 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.490
 a doll designed by the artist Stewart 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.530
 freeboard 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.630
 stewart took as his basis the drawings of lukas 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.160
 adding to the image of himself and the eyes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.710
 decided to make it look like an albert 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.540
 Einstein to shoot scenes with iodine 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.070
 had to raise the price above the ground and 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
 not cut through holes so that several 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.840
 the man was able to carry out his movement 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.760
 someone moved his hands with someone's eyes 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.220
 someone's ears during filming budget 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.650

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.640
 eventually took two Oscars finally fifth 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 the episode was over and 21 may 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.380
 eightieth year out 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.290
 the struggle for the galaxy continues 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.690
 despite the destruction of the death star 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.119
 the empire knocked out the rebels from their base on 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 planet yavin 4 and continues to search 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.960
 remnants of an alliance that hides its my 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.910
 base on the ice planet hot 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.040
 shooting landscapes that took place in 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.410
 Norway is located there and all of our 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.240
 heroes darth vader personally leads 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.250
 strongly empires involved in the search 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.680
 insurgents on his orders to all corners 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
 galaxies send probes scouts and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.820
 on hota during patrol han solo 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.519
 and chewbacca discovers an umbrella scout 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.410
 empire and destroy it but it has time 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.570
 send photos of the rebel base and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 Darth Vader send slot to destroy 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.620
 base after the battle hatch seen introduction 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.290
 killed she is forced to go on 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 planet dagoba there she even master yoda 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.220
 begin training the Jedi but 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.840
 circumstances make him fly away 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 to fight darth vader 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 I must pay tribute to Irvin Kershner as 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.099
 debutant blockbuster not screwed up 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.170
 continue and in my opinion even made 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.090
 better than episode 4 but of course under 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.890
 george lucas's shaggy hand but still 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.480
 I also really liked how I played 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.489
 the role of hatch mark hamill you only 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.720
 imagine he can say a whole month 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.120
 talking to myself 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.160
 with some strange iodine doll and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.780
 this is very believable i think that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.940
 this film is no less brilliant than 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.010
 the past and the sequel are good 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 you know often see reviews in which 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.390
 written type of star wars is not very 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.790
 stupid movie is absolutely not so movie 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 a lot of subtext in meaning from to 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.290
 example problems on love or and khan 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.209
 solo because of the pride of both hatch relationship 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.829
 to friendship in that moment when he speaks 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.170
 Yoga my friends are in trouble 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.180
 I have to help them and the conflict of the fathers and 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.769
 children can continue for a long time 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.690
 the film is much deeper than it seems 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.910
 it looks easy and you can see that people have a soul 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.709
 invest is another george's masterpiece 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.870
 which sinks deep into the soul and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.819
 the last thing I like in lukas even 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.040
 when the film budget exceeded set 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.739
 he did not retreat and became the first in the world 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.120
 independent director people see 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.860
 only good movie it is always there for now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.629
 now spoiler imagine the script 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.150
 was so classified that no one except 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.280
 lukas kirschner did not know the locations of the heroes 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.840
 and plot and when filmed the ending of the film 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.849
 where hatch speaks with vader 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.890
 only five minutes before the filming of an actor 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.959
 hatch and vader were told that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 it turns out vader his father and those on 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.670
 emotions from filmed this epic scene 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.220
 star wars episode 4 it's not easy 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.620
 the film is a cult movie which 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.450
 turned the whole world of cinema on 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.280
 which has grown several generations of this 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.550
 the film is the result of hellish labor george 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.550
 lukas
