hi<00:00:03.699> once<00:00:04.029> L<00:00:04.300> had<00:00:05.230> a<00:00:05.260> few<00:00:05.500> queries<00:00:05.770> on<00:00:06.450> boiler

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
hi once L had a few queries on boiler

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.900 
hi once L had a few queries on boiler
lockout<00:00:08.320> or<00:00:08.500> overheat

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
lockout or overheat

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.669 
lockout or overheat
it's<00:00:10.270> where<00:00:10.480> yeah<00:00:10.660> your<00:00:11.080> boiler<00:00:11.440> keeps

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679 
it's where yeah your boiler keeps

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.950 
it's where yeah your boiler keeps
cutting<00:00:11.980> out<00:00:12.250> and<00:00:12.550> you've<00:00:13.450> got<00:00:13.599> to<00:00:13.660> keep<00:00:13.750> going

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
cutting out and you've got to keep going

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.870 
cutting out and you've got to keep going
resetting<00:00:14.740> it<00:00:14.860> again<00:00:15.099> and<00:00:15.309> then<00:00:15.610> you<00:00:15.639> might

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
resetting it again and then you might

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.060 
resetting it again and then you might
find<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:16.209> he<00:00:16.299> runs<00:00:16.599> for<00:00:16.779> a<00:00:16.810> little<00:00:16.990> while<00:00:17.170> and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
find that he runs for a little while and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.010 
find that he runs for a little while and
then<00:00:18.250> it<00:00:18.310> goes<00:00:18.520> off<00:00:18.730> again<00:00:19.029> and<00:00:19.359> generous<00:00:19.930> the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
then it goes off again and generous the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.960 
then it goes off again and generous the
situation<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.710> usually<00:00:21.250> gets<00:00:21.490> worse<00:00:21.730> and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
situation it usually gets worse and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.060 
situation it usually gets worse and
worse<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.570> starts<00:00:23.020> off<00:00:23.199> very<00:00:23.230> slowly

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
worse it starts off very slowly

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.269 
worse it starts off very slowly
we<00:00:24.760> got<00:00:24.970> overheat<00:00:25.630> switching<00:00:26.320> off<00:00:26.500> and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
we got overheat switching off and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.790 
we got overheat switching off and
gradually<00:00:27.820> gets<00:00:28.029> worse<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.539> worse<00:00:28.599> until<00:00:29.080> in

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
gradually gets worse and worse until in

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.140 
gradually gets worse and worse until in
the<00:00:29.830> end<00:00:29.949> you<00:00:30.099> find<00:00:30.310> you're<00:00:30.490> pushing<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:30.939> damn

button on the reset and the boiler every

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.970 
button on the reset and the boiler every
five<00:00:34.120> minutes<00:00:34.330> so<00:00:34.570> what<00:00:35.320> does<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.590> mean<00:00:35.800> and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
on a boiler well here's mine on this

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.240 
on a boiler well here's mine on this
particular<00:00:44.680> boiler

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
particular boiler

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.440 
particular boiler
it's<00:00:46.090> called<00:00:46.329> lockout<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:49.000> can<00:00:49.180> hear<00:00:49.300> it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
it's called lockout and you can hear it

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.290 
it's called lockout and you can hear it
clicking<00:00:49.750> away<00:00:50.050> there<00:00:50.350> now<00:00:50.559> try<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:50.980> lie<00:00:51.460> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
clicking away there now try to lie and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.209 
clicking away there now try to lie and
sometimes<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:53.170> know<00:00:53.289> it<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:53.379> won't<00:00:53.739> come<00:00:54.010> on

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219

sometimes you know it just won't come on
you<00:00:54.430> can<00:00:54.579> know<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.820> clicked<00:00:55.059> away<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.480> gone

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

can see the little red light there and
if<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:03.070> comes<00:01:03.430> on<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.239> boiler<00:01:04.570> clicks

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
if that comes on the boiler clicks

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.140 
if that comes on the boiler clicks
straight<00:01:05.140> out<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:06.250> kind<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.820> safety

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
straight out this kind of like a safety

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.960 
straight out this kind of like a safety
valve<00:01:07.510> really<00:01:07.900> for<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.110> boiler<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.520> clicks

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
valve really for the boiler it clicks

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.450 
valve really for the boiler it clicks
out<00:01:10.180> if<00:01:10.299> it<00:01:10.420> gets<00:01:10.600> too<00:01:10.840> hot<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.409> makes<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
out if it gets too hot and makes the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.060 
out if it gets too hot and makes the
things<00:01:12.670> safe<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:13.750> what<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.590> do<00:01:14.710> about<00:01:14.830> it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
things safe so what can we do about it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.420 
things safe so what can we do about it
well<00:01:15.729> generally<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:17.260> means<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.860> you've<00:01:18.400> got

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
well generally it means that you've got

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.780 
well generally it means that you've got
a<00:01:18.580> blockage<00:01:19.030> somewhere<00:01:19.240> um<00:01:19.979> people<00:01:20.979> dive<00:01:21.520> for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
a blockage somewhere um people dive for

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.249 
a blockage somewhere um people dive for
the<00:01:21.850> central<00:01:22.270> heating<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.600> lot<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.110> time

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
the central heating a lot of time

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.740 
the central heating a lot of time
thinking<00:01:23.560> -<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.979> could<00:01:24.159> be<00:01:24.189> burnout<00:01:24.820> but

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
thinking - that could be burnout but

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.310 
thinking - that could be burnout but
most<00:01:26.470> times<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:28.210> pump<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.600> alright<00:01:28.960> and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
most times the pump is alright and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.380 
most times the pump is alright and
you'll<00:01:30.189> find<00:01:30.430> got<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> bucket<00:01:31.000> of<00:01:31.150> sludge

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
you'll find got a bucket of sludge

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.499 
you'll find got a bucket of sludge
somewhere<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.500> what<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.650> suggest<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.310> um<00:01:33.670> drain

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
somewhere so what I suggest is um drain

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.200 
somewhere so what I suggest is um drain
the<00:01:34.659> system<00:01:34.810> down<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:36.430> central<00:01:36.790> eating<00:01:37.000> down

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
the system down your central eating down

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.910 
the system down your central eating down
and<00:01:37.509> put<00:01:37.780> something<00:01:38.020> like<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.560> lot<00:01:38.650> got<00:01:38.860> on

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
and put something like this a lot got on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.010 
and put something like this a lot got on
the<00:01:39.009> screen<00:01:39.250> at<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.579> moment<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.180> really<00:01:40.630> rate

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
the screen at the moment I really rate

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.170 
the screen at the moment I really rate
this<00:01:41.229> one<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.979> made<00:01:42.400> by<00:01:42.610> sin<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.090> know

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
this one this is a made by sin to know

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.670 
this one this is a made by sin to know
when<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.570> x400

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
when it's x400

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.450 
when it's x400
and<00:01:45.399> it's<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.640> system<00:01:45.880> restore<00:01:46.240> or<00:01:46.750> basically

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and it's a system restore or basically

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.249 
and it's a system restore or basically
you<00:01:48.460> know<00:01:48.549> just<00:01:48.579> apply<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.390> after<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.020> drain

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
you know just apply in after you drain

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.830 
you know just apply in after you drain
down<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.430> it's<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.729> removal<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.180> sludge<00:01:52.570> and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
down and it's the removal of sludge and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.469 
down and it's the removal of sludge and
deposits<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.500> iron<00:01:53.619> oxide<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:55.030> broken

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
deposits of iron oxide and it's broken
