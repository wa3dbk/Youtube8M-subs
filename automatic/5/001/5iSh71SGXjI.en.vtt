00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.080
 how about friends from youtube I presented a 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:11.950
 man is Eduardo GarcÃ­a on a canal in 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.629
 youtube is tgn 89 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.150
 I want to share with you something that I just 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.850
 learn now 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 I want to achieve has wanted to achieve 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 English effect that djs use a lot 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:38.879
 Robert went up a tutorial on how to do it 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.949
 in adobe audition 1.5 this sensitive 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.950
 I want to do this repetition with 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.180
 this elevation of tone 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.370
 but in the hearing versions 1.5 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.020
 2.0 3.0 is very easy it's a matter of 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.530
 modify a slope in deformation 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.629
 of tone 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.629
 I want to achieve it in 66 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.990
 it has not been able to perfection 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.840
 this I just learned 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.030
 there are no how-to tutorials on 16 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 then I hope that this will serve them 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 base someone to do tests like 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 than me and achieve it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.210
 this is what I will use if we 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.979
 copy the day 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.979
 this first part 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.770
 let's paste it several times 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.190
 about 78 times it's the taste of each 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.080
 Who I comment to, I'm not a publisher 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.240
 professional but this is very useful for 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.490
 the spots 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.490
 Well, it sounds good 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 one more 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.100
 ok let's copy the 10 repeated 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.609
 minus the last one and we 're going to effects 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.830
 time and tone expansion and tone 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:13.730
 normally we go out here we go to 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.769
 hearing we are going to deform the tone in the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.400
 final deformation that we should get to 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:25.010
 zero that is the normal we put about 20 to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.010
 principle that is very high goes from more to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.040
 less then now we have to do 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 the same but now we are going to deform the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.500
 time let's do it more faster 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:47.079
 the final is 100 percent which is the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:49.650
 normal let's go the 37 which is faster and 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.019
 for my taste there is more or less 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 I'm missing something I do not know if I missed a 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.980
 tool or 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.700
 I do not know the truth 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.290
 but then I do not know it is not achieved with the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
 ease than previous versions 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.240
 but it is illogical that the 16 can not 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.569
 do it since it's supposed to be 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.569
 best 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.310
 I still do not succeed to perfection but 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.150
 well there they are tutorial I hope that they 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.150
 serve 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.250
 in that 6 is the first I think it's going to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.870
 have on youtube I hope it's from 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.870
 utility until then
