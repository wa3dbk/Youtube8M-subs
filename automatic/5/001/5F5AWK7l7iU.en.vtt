00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.339
 video I want to show you two very hairstyles 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.049
 easy and beautiful that I think they are going to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.880
 love and well the first thing I did was 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.559
 brush my hair very well until I 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.630
 I had no knots and already after 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.620
 apply this spray for heat because 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.620
 I'm going to tilt my hair 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.870
 in this case I will use one of the 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.430
 Wands of the heat and tanning of this kit 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.230
 comes with three different wands 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.790
 thicknesses and good again I have two 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.350
 discount codes for you the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.480
 first it is 100 dollars discount 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.520

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.080
 the ocean code and the other is 40 per 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.850
 One hundred discount on any curling iron 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.879
 iron plus 12 dollars of shipping to mexico 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.100
 using the code the beach after and 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.239
 the thickest wand and I decided not to use 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.640
 the glove because it makes me a little bit more 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.590
 difficult but good the only thing that we have 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.629
 what to do in those of our lanes 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.339
 as normally the students I do them 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.710
 for outside but even for inside 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.540
 they also look very good, I hope 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.250
 approximately 8 seconds in each 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.659
 want because I have so straight hair 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.100
 that they fall very very quickly then 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.620
 we want them well marked at the beginning 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.640
 and that's what we're going to ruffle for 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.379
 do not keep us as well as you should 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.760
 this step surely you already 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.470
 they know how to do it is very very easy there are only 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.970
 that tilt the hair very well so that 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.250
 let's have volume and we would rather 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.260
 This kit I love because it leaves you 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 the hair super good father the fagots you 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.740
 they leave the hair super father and besides you do not 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.180
 you leave it I think in your micros that yes 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 It is perfect because it looks more 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 natural and these Chinese are going to last all 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 all day 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.889
 [Music] 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.470
 after this I like to comb 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 a little bit so I do not have that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.220
 marked and applied a little spray to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.660
 combing to make me last all day 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.200
 but nothing else so that I do not know 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.200
 see the hair too 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.310
 and well now what you say you can comb 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 a little more and more and more and more up 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.470
 that I stayed like that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.479
 the first hairstyle is very easy only 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.790
 you have to take two strands of hair and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 you will cross them twice after you go to 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 see that you're going to stay a hair down that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 hair down will release it after you go 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.069
 to take a lock quoted from below and you're going 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.540
 to cross with the hair above this hair 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.700
 that you had above is going to be 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.959
 down then it will drop and good me 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.910
 every account that I told them as a 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.440
 tongue twister huge but I did not know 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.209
 very well how to explain it but I think 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.730
 that if you watch the video you will be able to give 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.440
 idea of ​​how is this hairstyle is very 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.830
 very easy when you have finished until the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 half 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.150
 amaral or with a limit and ready now 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.440
 let's do the other side what can you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.760
 so to leave the truth to me is that I 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
 loved how it looked like 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.220
 but also the 15 6 on the other side to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.220

 [Music] 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.349
 but if you also want it from the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.750
 the other side the only thing they have to do 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.920
 it's the same to grab two meters of hair 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:02.860
 cross miss crossing total crossing 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.860

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.040
 as the other part of the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.440
 hair the only thing you have to do is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.820
 a half tail obviously grabbing 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.740
 the two meters milestones that we have 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.630
 was going to be a hole in the middle and 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.630
 you will pass this little tail inside 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.999
 [Music] 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.980

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.710
 I really love how it looks is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.850
 very natural is very simple and also if 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.070

 go to the cinema to go to the park for what 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.450

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 Delgaditas or gorditas I recommend you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.520
 that you make them of legálitas first already 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.480
