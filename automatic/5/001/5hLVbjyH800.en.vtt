mentioning<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.440> I'm<00:03:02.680> running<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.250> know

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
mentioning that I'm running you know

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.930 
mentioning that I'm running you know
video<00:03:03.580> capture<00:03:04.210> right<00:03:04.390> now<00:03:04.570> which<00:03:04.780> also<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
video capture right now which also you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
video capture right now which also you
know<00:03:07.030> uses<00:03:07.510> up<00:03:07.660> system<00:03:08.590> resources<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.610> CPU<00:03:10.450> so

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
know uses up system resources and CPU so

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.640 
know uses up system resources and CPU so
let's<00:03:11.770> look<00:03:12.070> at<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.490> CPU<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.870> task<00:03:14.500> manager

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
let's look at the CPU the task manager

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.730 
let's look at the CPU the task manager
and<00:03:15.390> as<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.750> see<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:17.200> hovering<00:03:17.410> at

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
and as you can see it's hovering at

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.470 
and as you can see it's hovering at
around<00:03:18.660> fifty<00:03:19.660> percent<00:03:19.930> CPU<00:03:21.120> it'll<00:03:22.120> dip<00:03:22.330> down

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
around fifty percent CPU it'll dip down

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.420 
around fifty percent CPU it'll dip down
to<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.810> 40<00:03:23.200> or<00:03:23.230> 30<00:03:23.470> once<00:03:23.800> in<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.980> while<00:03:24.130> but

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
to like 40 or 30 once in a while but

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.780 
to like 40 or 30 once in a while but
it's<00:03:24.580> generally<00:03:24.880> around<00:03:26.280> high<00:03:27.280> 40s<00:03:27.880> low<00:03:27.940> 50s

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
it's generally around high 40s low 50s

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.820 
it's generally around high 40s low 50s
which<00:03:30.790> i<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.330> pretty<00:03:31.570> fair<00:03:32.200> considering

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
which i think is pretty fair considering

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.650 
which i think is pretty fair considering
I'm<00:03:33.040> doing<00:03:33.340> video<00:03:33.580> capture<00:03:34.030> right<00:03:34.210> now<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
I'm doing video capture right now and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.500 
I'm doing video capture right now and
running<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.560> virtual<00:03:35.920> machine<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.430> all<00:03:37.300> these

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
running a virtual machine and all these

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.490 
running a virtual machine and all these
other<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.140> know<00:03:38.200> applications<00:03:39.100> running<00:03:40.500> it

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
other you know applications running it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.810 
other you know applications running it
is<00:03:42.130> using<00:03:42.820> 2.8<00:03:43.720> two<00:03:44.050> gigabytes<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.860> RAM<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.460> have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
is using 2.8 two gigabytes of RAM I have

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.640 
is using 2.8 two gigabytes of RAM I have
four<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.360> my<00:03:46.570> system<00:03:46.870> right<00:03:47.050> now<00:03:48.210> I<00:03:49.210> I<00:03:49.870> again

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
four on my system right now I I again

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.200 
four on my system right now I I again
I'd<00:03:50.830> say<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.160> pretty<00:03:51.310> fair<00:03:51.670> considering

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
I'd say that's pretty fair considering

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.980 
I'd say that's pretty fair considering
what<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.450> have<00:03:52.690> open<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.260> running<00:03:53.470> right<00:03:53.710> now

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.740 

and<00:03:56.370> virtual<00:03:57.370> machine<00:03:57.730> all<00:03:58.360> these<00:03:58.690> things

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and virtual machine all these things

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.430 
and virtual machine all these things
running<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.440> in<00:03:59.590> seven<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.760> now

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.980 

I'm<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.460> going<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.670> say<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.840> uses

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
I'm not going to say that it uses

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.050 
I'm not going to say that it uses
the<00:04:09.530> least<00:04:09.770> amount<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.190> RAM<00:04:10.490> out<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.850> anything

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
the least amount of RAM out of anything

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.090 
the least amount of RAM out of anything
out<00:04:11.360> there<00:04:11.740> multitasking<00:04:12.790> but

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
out there multitasking but

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.180 
out there multitasking but
I<00:04:15.190> think<00:04:16.000> seven<00:04:16.570> does<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.530> handles

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
I think seven does it handles

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.070 
I think seven does it handles
multitasking<00:04:18.940> very<00:04:19.150> well<00:04:19.330> it<00:04:19.480> doesn't<00:04:19.810> it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
multitasking very well it doesn't it

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.590 
multitasking very well it doesn't it
doesn't<00:04:20.110> you<00:04:20.800> know<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.700> doesn't<00:04:21.850> necessarily

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
doesn't you know it doesn't necessarily

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.720 
doesn't you know it doesn't necessarily
minimize<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.650> RAM<00:04:23.830> you're<00:04:24.040> using<00:04:24.220> but<00:04:24.550> I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
minimize the RAM you're using but I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.000 
minimize the RAM you're using but I
think<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.840> functions<00:04:26.380> really<00:04:26.650> smoothly

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
think it it functions really smoothly

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.520 
think it it functions really smoothly
and<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:28.270> makes<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.870> what<00:04:29.200> you're<00:04:29.350> actually

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
and it makes use of what you're actually

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.760 
and it makes use of what you're actually
using<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.600> smooth<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.200> works<00:04:32.500> well

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
using it's it's smooth it works well

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.380 
using it's it's smooth it works well
multitasking<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:35.440> know<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:35.740> mean<00:04:36.180> Ram<00:04:37.180> is

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
multitasking and you know I mean Ram is

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.150 
multitasking and you know I mean Ram is
at<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.600> this<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.200> four<00:04:38.560> gigabytes<00:04:39.010> of

at that this is just four gigabytes of

at that this is just four gigabytes of

is nothing spectacular at all I have a

is nothing spectacular at all I have a

nothing about my computer special four
gigabytes<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.490> pretty<00:04:54.730> decent<00:04:55.090> but<00:04:55.300> again

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
gigabytes is pretty decent but again

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.720 
gigabytes is pretty decent but again
it's<00:04:55.750> it's<00:04:56.110> ddr2<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:56.890> not<00:04:57.040> even<00:04:57.250> ddr3<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:59.730> so

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
it's it's ddr2 it's not even ddr3 and so

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.150 
it's it's ddr2 it's not even ddr3 and so
that's<00:05:01.000> pretty<00:05:01.330> much<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:02.170> just<00:05:02.440> wanted<00:05:03.130> to

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
that's pretty much it I just wanted to

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.310 
that's pretty much it I just wanted to
test<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.820> out<00:05:03.880> show<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.330> guys<00:05:04.570> how<00:05:04.630> Windows

test that out show you guys how Windows

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.770 
test that out show you guys how Windows
7<00:05:06.840> multitasks<00:05:07.840> they're<00:05:08.290> out<00:05:08.470> handles

which<00:05:10.470> in<00:05:10.590> my<00:05:10.710> opinion<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.100> pretty<00:05:11.370> good<00:05:12.080> so

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
which in my opinion is pretty good so

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.910
