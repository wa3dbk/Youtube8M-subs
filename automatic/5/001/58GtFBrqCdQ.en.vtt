it<00:04:04.800> again<00:04:05.800> but<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.459> might<00:04:06.670> just<00:04:06.850> buy<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.030> one<00:04:07.180> I

it again but I might just buy the one I
already<00:04:07.510> opened<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.640> here's<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.209> card<00:04:10.450> itself

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
already opened so here's the card itself

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.170 
already opened so here's the card itself
and<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:15.280> know<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.400> looks<00:04:15.520> like<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.670> 290x

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
and I don't know it looks like a 290x

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.720 
and I don't know it looks like a 290x
but<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:17.140> guess<00:04:17.500> slightly<00:04:17.980> different<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:18.609> got

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
but I guess slightly different it's got

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.940 
but I guess slightly different it's got
these<00:04:18.940> like<00:04:20.100> well<00:04:21.100> inlets<00:04:21.609> here<00:04:21.910> for<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> fan

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
these like well inlets here for the fan

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.440 
these like well inlets here for the fan
I<00:04:23.950> don't<00:04:24.520> know<00:04:24.730> if<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.970> actually<00:04:25.120> does

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
I don't know if that actually does

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.850 
I don't know if that actually does
anything<00:04:26.160> very<00:04:27.160> toxic<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.000> feeling<00:04:28.830> kind<00:04:29.830> of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
anything very toxic you feeling kind of

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.270 
anything very toxic you feeling kind of
feels<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.190> she<00:04:30.520> lost<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:31.890> that's<00:04:32.890> okay

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
feels like she lost it but that's okay

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.760 
feels like she lost it but that's okay
it's<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.850> GPU<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:34.780> only<00:04:35.560> there<00:04:35.740> for

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
it's a GPU it's only there for

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.640 
it's a GPU it's only there for
aesthetics<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:37.690> doesn't<00:04:37.960> look<00:04:38.169> cheap<00:04:38.200> but

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
aesthetics and it doesn't look cheap but

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.650 
aesthetics and it doesn't look cheap but
it<00:04:38.890> feels<00:04:39.070> sheet<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:39.610> they<00:04:40.240> got<00:04:40.390> something

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
it feels sheet so they got something

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.050 
it feels sheet so they got something
good<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:40.840> there<00:04:41.229> for<00:04:41.410> them<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.860> then<00:04:42.490> up

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
good going there for them and then up

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.240 
good going there for them and then up
top<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.570> can<00:04:43.690> see<00:04:43.870> Radeon<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.620> black<00:04:44.890> right

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.390 
top you can see Radeon and black right
here<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.440> then<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.680> can<00:04:47.770> actually<00:04:47.979> see<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
here and then you can actually see the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
whatever because water bottles will come

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.670

from<00:05:57.340> here<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.820> stop<00:05:58.330> on<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.630> DVI<00:05:59.020> can't<00:05:59.530> just

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
from here and stop on the DVI can't just

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.460 
from here and stop on the DVI can't just
cut<00:06:00.400> through<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.700> you<00:06:00.820> know<00:06:01.140> there's<00:06:02.140> a<00:06:02.230> fan

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
cut through it you know there's a fan

cut through it you know there's a fan
blower<00:06:02.860> type<00:06:05.370> yaps<00:06:06.370> we're<00:06:06.580> saying<00:06:06.730> it's<00:06:06.850> loud

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
blower type yaps we're saying it's loud

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.270 
blower type yaps we're saying it's loud
too<00:06:07.390> so<00:06:07.930> hopefully<00:06:08.920> I'll<00:06:09.220> find<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.550> out<00:06:09.780> and

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
too so hopefully I'll find that out and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.780 
too so hopefully I'll find that out and
yeah<00:06:12.280> PCB<00:06:13.120> on<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.300> back<00:06:13.480> and<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:14.790> unison

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
yeah PCB on the back and the unison

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.250 
yeah PCB on the back and the unison
actually<00:06:16.240> extends<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.660> little<00:06:16.870> bit<00:06:17.020> further

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
actually extends a little bit further

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
actually extends a little bit further
than<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.740> PCB<00:06:18.330> not<00:06:19.330> sure<00:06:19.540> why<00:06:19.810> maybe<00:06:20.800> any

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
than the PCB not sure why maybe any

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.880 
than the PCB not sure why maybe any
components<00:06:21.820> do<00:06:21.970> run<00:06:22.180> pretty<00:06:22.390> horn<00:06:22.890> not

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
components do run pretty horn not

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.380 
components do run pretty horn not
entirely<00:06:24.340> sure<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:25.420> then<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.940> know<00:06:28.030> I'm

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
entirely sure and then you know I'm

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.240 
entirely sure and then you know I'm
sorry<00:06:28.720> it's<00:06:28.900> almost<00:06:29.140> companies<00:06:29.530> take<00:06:29.740> a<00:06:29.770> tiny

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
sorry it's almost companies take a tiny

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.130 
sorry it's almost companies take a tiny
step<00:06:30.400> forward<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:31.270> you<00:06:31.540> know<00:06:31.870> they<00:06:32.020> put

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
step forward and you know they put

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.730 
step forward and you know they put
little<00:06:32.440> covers<00:06:32.830> over<00:06:33.040> the<00:06:33.190> stuff<00:06:33.610> you<00:06:33.850> know

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
little covers over the stuff you know

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.230 
little covers over the stuff you know
and<00:06:35.740> they<00:06:35.890> don't<00:06:36.070> charge<00:06:36.280> extra<00:06:36.430> like<00:06:36.850> or

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
and they don't charge extra like or

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.060 
and they don't charge extra like or
anything<00:06:37.420> you<00:06:37.750> know<00:06:37.960> toss<00:06:38.290> them<00:06:38.560> like

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
anything you know toss them like

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.920 
anything you know toss them like
probably<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.610> penny<00:06:39.940> for<00:06:40.240> all<00:06:40.300> that<00:06:40.510> stuff<00:06:40.750> but

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
probably a penny for all that stuff but

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.480 
probably a penny for all that stuff but
it's<00:06:41.050> just<00:06:41.110> nice<00:06:41.380> to<00:06:41.440> have<00:06:41.920> that<00:06:42.100> there<00:06:42.340> you

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
it's just nice to have that there you

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.980 
it's just nice to have that there you
know<00:06:42.670> like<00:06:42.820> I'm<00:06:43.000> grabbing<00:06:43.480> it<00:06:43.570> and<00:06:43.750> I'm<00:06:43.840> not

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
know like I'm grabbing it and I'm not

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.380 
know like I'm grabbing it and I'm not
touching<00:06:44.410> it<00:06:44.530> which<00:06:44.740> isn't<00:06:45.670> do<00:06:46.060> anything

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
touching it which isn't do anything

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.320 
touching it which isn't do anything
anyway<00:06:46.660> but<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.080> feels<00:06:47.590> awkward<00:06:48.010> you<00:06:49.000> know<00:06:49.030> and

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330

MSI<00:06:53.590> r9<00:06:54.310> 290<00:06:55.060> I<00:06:55.300> will<00:06:55.870> be<00:06:56.020> benchmarking<00:06:56.650> it

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
MSI r9 290 I will be benchmarking it

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.180 
MSI r9 290 I will be benchmarking it
very<00:06:57.220> soon<00:06:57.670> Lee<00:06:58.140> quickly<00:06:59.140> assume<00:06:59.680> Lee<00:06:59.830> yeah

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
very soon Lee quickly assume Lee yeah

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.840 
very soon Lee quickly assume Lee yeah
quickly<00:07:00.900> and<00:07:01.950> but<00:07:02.950> the<00:07:03.070> thing<00:07:03.250> is<00:07:03.280> is<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.640> new

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
quickly and but the thing is is I new

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.640 
quickly and but the thing is is I new
kind<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.270> build<00:07:04.510> and<00:07:05.140> you've<00:07:05.350> been<00:07:05.470> Church

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
kind of build and you've been Church

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.080 
kind of build and you've been Church
mother<00:07:05.860> Gothic<00:07:06.220> starts<00:07:06.490> to<00:07:06.580> compare<00:07:06.880> it<00:07:06.970> to

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
mother Gothic starts to compare it to

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.400 
mother Gothic starts to compare it to
otherwise<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.660> results<00:07:07.930> are<00:07:08.020> kinda<00:07:08.200> useless

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
otherwise the results are kinda useless

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.550 
otherwise the results are kinda useless
I<00:07:08.890> mean<00:07:09.730> I<00:07:10.090> know<00:07:10.780> that's<00:07:11.050> how<00:07:11.140> we<00:07:11.200> used<00:07:11.380> to<00:07:11.500> do

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
I mean I know that's how we used to do

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.080 
I mean I know that's how we used to do
it<00:07:11.680> before<00:07:11.800> but<00:07:12.160> I<00:07:12.280> guess<00:07:12.340> no<00:07:12.550> one<00:07:12.700> liked<00:07:12.910> it

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
it before but I guess no one liked it

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.460 
it before but I guess no one liked it
like<00:07:13.240> that<00:07:13.450> so<00:07:13.810> I'll<00:07:14.770> be<00:07:15.070> including<00:07:15.430> other

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
like that so I'll be including other

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.600 
like that so I'll be including other
performance<00:07:17.470> numbers<00:07:17.770> from<00:07:17.920> other<00:07:18.130> graphics

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
performance numbers from other graphics

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.000 
performance numbers from other graphics
cards<00:07:18.850> as<00:07:18.970> well<00:07:19.150> so<00:07:19.930> it'll<00:07:20.230> take<00:07:20.350> me<00:07:20.590> a<00:07:20.620> little

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
cards as well so it'll take me a little

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.980 
cards as well so it'll take me a little
bit<00:07:21.220> but<00:07:21.790> it<00:07:22.120> really<00:07:22.420> shouldn't<00:07:22.750> take<00:07:22.930> too

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
bit but it really shouldn't take too

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.320 
bit but it really shouldn't take too
