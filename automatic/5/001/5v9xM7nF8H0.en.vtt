00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
level you know last year we sent a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.000 
level you know last year we sent a

enthusiasts market when we launched the
Hellcats<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:16.220> were<00:01:16.369> very<00:01:16.610> careful<00:01:17.210> on<00:01:17.630> how

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
Hellcats and we were very careful on how

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.960 
Hellcats and we were very careful on how
we<00:01:17.869> position<00:01:18.140> those<00:01:18.590> cars<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:19.369> position<00:01:19.850> them

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
we position those cars we position them

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.410 
we position those cars we position them
as<00:01:20.180> muscle<00:01:20.900> cars<00:01:21.110> not<00:01:21.710> as<00:01:22.040> track<00:01:22.490> cars<00:01:22.820> because

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
as muscle cars not as track cars because

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.900 
as muscle cars not as track cars because
we<00:01:23.660> believe<00:01:24.050> we<00:01:24.500> already<00:01:24.710> had<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.460> ultimate

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
we believe we already had the ultimate

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.109 
we believe we already had the ultimate
track<00:01:26.150> car<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.050> Viper<00:01:27.850> when<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:28.940> think

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
track car in the Viper when you think

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.080 
track car in the Viper when you think
about<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.390> 2016<00:01:30.290> Viper<00:01:30.800> ACR<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.610> really<00:01:31.940> have

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
about the 2016 Viper ACR you really have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.910 
about the 2016 Viper ACR you really have
to<00:01:32.210> put<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:32.570> perspective<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.350> history

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
to put it in perspective of the history

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.380 
to put it in perspective of the history
of<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.220> 20-plus<00:01:34.640> years<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.150> we've<00:01:35.270> been

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
of the 20-plus years that we've been

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.210 
of the 20-plus years that we've been
building<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.810> Viper<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.290> mean<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:36.890> back<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
building the Viper I mean think back to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.219 
building the Viper I mean think back to
the<00:01:37.310> first<00:01:37.340> generation<00:01:38.060> Viper<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.780> gen<00:01:39.050> 1

the first generation Viper the gen 1

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.680 
the first generation Viper the gen 1
Viper<00:01:39.470> had<00:01:39.950> 400<00:01:40.610> horsepower<00:01:40.850> had<00:01:41.420> no

today's car the gen 5 car not the ACR

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.700 
today's car the gen 5 car not the ACR
