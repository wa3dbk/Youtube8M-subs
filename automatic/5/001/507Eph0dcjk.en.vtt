packages<00:00:58.159> of<00:00:58.519> if<00:00:59.299> Peavy<00:00:59.750> equipment<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.350> you

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
packages of if Peavy equipment that you

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.140 
packages of if Peavy equipment that you
could<00:01:00.799> build<00:01:01.369> yourself<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.850> put<00:01:02.030> together

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
could build yourself a put together

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.929 
could build yourself a put together
yourself<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.809> used<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.890> fly<00:01:04.070> fpv<00:01:04.280> because

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
yourself and used to fly fpv because

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.429 
yourself and used to fly fpv because
there<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.330> many<00:01:05.600> variables<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:06.380> it

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
there are so many variables then it

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.870 
there are so many variables then it
becomes<00:01:06.680> quite<00:01:06.799> difficult<00:01:07.070> if<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.729> are

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
becomes quite difficult if you are

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.690 
becomes quite difficult if you are
unfamiliar<00:01:08.450> with<00:01:08.750> if<00:01:09.260> Peavy<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:10.189> design<00:01:10.490> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
unfamiliar with if Peavy to design and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.580 
unfamiliar with if Peavy to design and
build<00:01:10.729> your<00:01:11.000> own<00:01:11.030> fpv<00:01:11.630> setup<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:12.289> going<00:01:12.530> to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
build your own fpv setup so I'm going to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.499 
build your own fpv setup so I'm going to
do<00:01:12.710> everything<00:01:12.859> from<00:01:13.189> what<00:01:13.789> I<00:01:13.820> call<00:01:14.030> bareback

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
do everything from what I call bareback

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.169 
do everything from what I call bareback
fpv<00:01:15.109> which<00:01:15.409> is<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.710> very<00:01:15.920> basic<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.670> simplest

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
fpv which is the very basic the simplest

the other bills and muscles that you
could<00:01:25.759> possibly<00:01:25.969> hope<00:01:26.570> for<00:01:26.600> now<00:01:26.899> somewhere

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
could possibly hope for now somewhere

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.440

between<00:01:27.740> bareback<00:01:28.219> and<00:01:28.399> fully<00:01:28.909> featured<00:01:29.149> is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
between bareback and fully featured is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.719 
between bareback and fully featured is
probably<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.380> kind<00:01:30.649> of<00:01:30.740> system<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.549> you

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
probably the kind of system that you

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.550 
probably the kind of system that you
might<00:01:31.969> be<00:01:31.999> interested<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.570> flying<00:01:32.990> this

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
might be interested in flying this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.349 
might be interested in flying this
summer<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.549> winter<00:01:34.820> down<00:01:34.969> here<00:01:35.179> than

to<00:01:38.960> get<00:01:39.079> into<00:01:39.229> fpv<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:39.859> that's<00:01:40.039> we're<00:01:40.549> going<00:01:40.670> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
to get into fpv so that's we're going to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.489 
to get into fpv so that's we're going to
be<00:01:40.789> focusing<00:01:40.969> on<00:01:41.359> in<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.569> few<00:01:41.719> upcoming<00:01:41.960> videos

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
working on it over the last couple of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.040 
working on it over the last couple of
weeks<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.519> design<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.030> hopefully<00:04:02.870> I'll<00:04:02.959> have

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
weeks and design and hopefully I'll have

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.330 
weeks and design and hopefully I'll have
it<00:04:03.110> sorted<00:04:03.380> out<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.709> couple<00:04:03.830> more<00:04:04.010> weeks<00:04:04.130> and

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
it sorted out in a couple more weeks and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.150 
it sorted out in a couple more weeks and
it<00:04:04.790> becomes<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.330> better<00:04:05.840> option<00:04:06.170> than<00:04:06.590> those

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
it becomes a better option than those

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.540 
it becomes a better option than those
glasses<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.300> lot<00:04:08.690> cheaper<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.280> if

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
glasses and it's a lot cheaper so and if

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.009 
glasses and it's a lot cheaper so and if
you<00:04:10.610> wear<00:04:10.760> prescription<00:04:10.970> glasses<00:04:11.300> like<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.959> do

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
you wear prescription glasses like I do

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.320 
you wear prescription glasses like I do
you<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.650> still<00:04:12.830> wear<00:04:12.950> your<00:04:13.070> glasses<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:14.120> it's

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
you can still wear your glasses so it's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.820 
you can still wear your glasses so it's
not<00:04:14.810> putting<00:04:15.050> your<00:04:15.170> head<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.410> box<00:04:15.560> or

not putting your head in a box or
anything<00:04:16.010> like<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.549> what<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> think<00:04:17.359> is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
anything like that it's what I think is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.930 
anything like that it's what I think is
a<00:04:17.479> rather<00:04:17.780> elegant<00:04:18.019> way<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.850> enable<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:19.910> to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
a rather elegant way to enable you to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.170 
a rather elegant way to enable you to
fly<00:04:20.120> fpv<00:04:20.380> without<00:04:21.380> glasses<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.940> price

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
fly fpv without glasses and the price

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.100 
fly fpv without glasses and the price
looks<00:04:23.450> as<00:04:23.570> though<00:04:23.660> it's<00:04:23.750> going<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.930> be<00:04:24.020> about

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
looks as though it's going to be about

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.320 
looks as though it's going to be about
100<00:04:24.830> bucks<00:04:25.040> which<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.550> lot<00:04:25.820> cheaper<00:04:25.850> than

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
100 bucks which is a lot cheaper than

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.000 
100 bucks which is a lot cheaper than
any<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.050> useful<00:04:27.530> glasses<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:27.950> the

resolution will be 800 x 600 that's

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.610
