00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello everybody here is the level of sales in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 portugal this we are seeing a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 Brazilian to the pits 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.039
 the androids many dishes on drugs or 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 and software is though I like it I'm not 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 person judged this video was in the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.060
 offered by the English colleagues of the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 and by this time I know so much 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.679
 how are you practically that 's why I'm going 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.410
 steal some preview paragraphs from the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 tone and some questions that put it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 morning creative director 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 Ubisoft 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 one of the things that tone is here now 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.780
 trying to figure out how to spend 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.149
 factory 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 looks like a factory is one of the things that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.530
 President sight that left him 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 particularly interested was that the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 production of the protagonist of the event 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 if it will be very similar to that of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.149
 not properly in terms 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 characterization but rather in the form 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 how the world itself is changing the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.990
 character as the island has changed 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.600
 Jackson quite also hopes that the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 city of chicago is capable of 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 must realize how they know 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.140
 we are one and so our main 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.700
 priority is to invade the systems 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.240
 computer 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 for example here control the camera for 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.700
 investigating the thing does not go that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 platform p-33 guard and motif goes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 hold back 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.700
 this evidence in the quality of the scenarios is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 why are you eating a version of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.580
 playstation 4 ever and development 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.350
 new generation 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 here to do the exact same thing 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 open the gate 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.030
 a kind of sneaky gameplay but it's 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.860
 a great advantage of this type of games 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.720
 can we point out the problems 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.170
 in many ways 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 here she chose not to draw attention 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:06.390
 will now have the taste of this platform 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:11.430
 is when the shooting also 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 will only end with a button 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.470
 we have two types of ex different 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.060
 It's the simple thing that happens, but it's going to have the fan. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.340
 the person passing on the street camera 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.350
 the cash register and then 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.960
 a larger sex ratio that allow 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.940
 access the system approaches the city and 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.250
 book area involving the objectives of 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.710
 area a little higher put in the far cry 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.440
 3 200 people we meet in 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.790
 street has a particular importance is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.290
 how can you see let's go 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.540
 various types of information about each 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.310
 the way we cross classes 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.140
 the profession is considered obscure and 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.040
 through these characters of the game will 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.840
 generate various types of random events 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.720
 much of what gives life is not the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.220
 world as the creative director of the game 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.410
 in the morning hotel told our 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 English colleagues to not just create a 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.770
 city ​​a big and beautiful city is 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.510
 I need to deal with the chaos that happens in 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.170
 a real city make the world really 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.209
 incredible still do not know much about 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.830
 main topic but ensuring that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.170
 there were goals all over the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.880
 side missions and not all 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.810
 they are going to have to do with crime 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.790
 this is one of the most 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.070
 interesting to devotees is how docs 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
 how can we conquer as a watchman 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.130
 in a kind of long time beats 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 during 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.960
 there behind criminals with our brands 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.880
 where the female can by 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.820
 simply hole is for example here 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.490
 we give a pain was the young baker the web 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.080
 that breaks an individual and picks up a 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.610
 romantic scene with a plastic doll 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.320
 a dummy 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.320
 finally each as you like 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.650
 we will also have to wait for the next 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.120
 months to get more details about the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.640
 multiplayer mode 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.800
 but it has already been confirmed that we can 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.270
 to cross in the single player adventure with 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.310
 other players played their own 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.020
 adventure for example it can happen that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.230
 will have to watch letters 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.760
 and in fact , and this is another player and 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.340
 can also happen and not 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.010
 always the game will tell us that we are 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.240
 objects by another person once goes 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.650
 do other times not 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.720
 we will have to wait for more details 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.639
 about how this type of 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.990
 intelligence 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.330
 the enterprise exists a lot with whom 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.189
 interact and play between factions of 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.539
 according to the internal tests the forecast 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.999
 that the sea is about 80 hours 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.289
 compute all goals of the newspaper 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.180
 there will also be other small 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.770
 accusations because for example if you have a 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.469
 smartphone arrives patina application 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.879
 contracts with the procedures or 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.569
 just search for a song on the radio 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.370
 local 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.719
 there is even a non-iTunes version 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.060
 we have to buy new music and 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.800
 applications using the game currency is 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.930
 However, the mode ensured that nothing 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.029
 It had to do with the transactions 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.849
 we can buy but I can not location 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:05:05.310
 they try to live or if they owe money 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:07.439
 if you make more prestigious studio in the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.069
 segment we will be able to see how the 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.389
 cars with big car and also the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.310
 persecution a police chase 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.569
 which I suspect will be a constant 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.150
 during the game 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.219
 It's also when we drive, we can ask. 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.499
 but with electronic stars including 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.960
 more obvious then four is 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.840
 positive 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.790
 and to get the game 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.970
 I did not shoot the car, I started to play. 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.340
 have changed dream of winning here a 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:40.160
 example why boys ground advantage 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.680
 the computer is and finally escape is 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.419
 small Tuesday here lends garage side 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.110
 right without anyone noticing 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.110
 she broke 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.910
 do not forget to subscribe to the
