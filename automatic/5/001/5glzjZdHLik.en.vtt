ophthalmology and eye care and this
episode<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.610> would<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.150> explain<00:00:09.480> how<00:00:09.540> we

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
episode I would like to explain how we

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.169 
episode I would like to explain how we
handle<00:00:10.260> astigmatism<00:00:10.759> after<00:00:11.759> corneal

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
handle astigmatism after corneal

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.150 
handle astigmatism after corneal
transplants<00:00:12.809> because<00:00:13.320> many<00:00:13.620> people<00:00:13.830> they

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
transplants because many people they

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.189 
transplants because many people they
have<00:00:14.429> corneal<00:00:14.969> transplants<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.719> develop<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
have corneal transplants can develop a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
have corneal transplants can develop a
stigmatism<00:00:16.619> even<00:00:17.400> large<00:00:17.699> levels<00:00:18.210> of

stigmatism even large levels of
astigmatism<00:00:19.070> afterwards<00:00:20.330> as<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.720> remember

astigmatism afterwards as you remember
from<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.529> previous<00:00:22.800> episode<00:00:23.490> astigmatism<00:00:24.300> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
from our previous episode astigmatism is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
from our previous episode astigmatism is
an<00:00:25.170> uneven<00:00:25.590> curvature<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> front<00:00:27.269> part<00:00:27.480> of

the eye on the cornea with a transplant

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.750 
the eye on the cornea with a transplant
we<00:00:32.250> replace<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.510> center<00:00:33.899> part<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> cornea

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
we replace the center part of the cornea

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
we replace the center part of the cornea
remove<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> replace<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> donor

stitches all the way around the edge

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.020 
stitches all the way around the edge
we<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.510> sometimes<00:00:46.289> six<00:00:46.920> months<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> a

we take sometimes six months up to a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.600 
we take sometimes six months up to a
year<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> remove<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:50.010> stitches<00:00:50.250> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
year or two to remove these stitches as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.420 
year or two to remove these stitches as
we<00:00:50.969> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.620> doing<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we need to and when we're doing that we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.290 
we need to and when we're doing that we
can<00:00:53.750> selectively<00:00:54.750> take<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.770> certain<00:00:56.190> ones<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
can selectively take out certain ones to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
can selectively take out certain ones to
try<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> control<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> astigmatism<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:59.100> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
try and control the astigmatism as it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.260 
try and control the astigmatism as it's
healing<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:02.010> we've<00:01:02.250> learned<00:01:02.520> from

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
healing but like we've learned from

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.070 
healing but like we've learned from
doing<00:01:03.449> transplants<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> primary

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
doing transplants we think the primary

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.859 
doing transplants we think the primary
determination<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.159> astigmatism<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
determination of the astigmatism as the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.750 
determination of the astigmatism as the
wound<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> healing<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.619> actually<00:01:11.430> from

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
wound is healing is actually from

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.590 
wound is healing is actually from
changes<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.020> tissue<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> scarring<00:01:15.330> as

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
changes in the tissue and scarring as

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.800 
changes in the tissue and scarring as
the<00:01:15.990> wound<00:01:16.200> heals<00:01:16.729> because<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the wound heals because of this we can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.679 
the wound heals because of this we can
only<00:01:19.049> control<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.220> by<00:01:21.000> removing<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
only control so much by removing the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.179 
only control so much by removing the
stitches<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.229> placed<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
stitches that are placed at the time of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
stitches that are placed at the time of
surgery<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> other

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
surgery so then we have to go to other

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.249 
surgery so then we have to go to other
ways<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.890> control<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> astigmatism<00:01:26.960> if<00:01:27.960> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ways to control the astigmatism if it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
ways to control the astigmatism if it's
a<00:01:28.439> high<00:01:28.860> enough<00:01:29.130> level<00:01:29.189> wear<00:01:30.090> glasses<00:01:30.720> or

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a high enough level wear glasses or

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.069 
a high enough level wear glasses or
contact<00:01:32.159> lenses<00:01:32.220> including<00:01:33.180> rigid<00:01:33.659> contact

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
contact lenses including rigid contact

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
contact lenses including rigid contact
lenses<00:01:34.470> can't<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> astigmatism<00:01:36.150> control

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
lenses can't get the astigmatism control

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
lenses can't get the astigmatism control
well<00:01:37.200> enough<00:01:38.270> we<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> surgically<00:01:40.259> by

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
well enough we can do this surgically by

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
well enough we can do this surgically by
modifying<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.990> wound<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.799> placing<00:01:44.280> extra

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
modifying the wound by placing extra

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.960 
modifying the wound by placing extra
incisions<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.930> cornea<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.820> helping<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
incisions in the cornea and helping to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.469 
incisions in the cornea and helping to
relax<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> wound<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.020> certain<00:01:49.409> areas<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.479> by

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
relax the wound in certain areas or by

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560 
relax the wound in certain areas or by
placing<00:01:51.750> extra<00:01:52.220> stitches<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.909> same<00:01:54.299> time

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
placing extra stitches at the same time

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.649 
placing extra stitches at the same time
to<00:01:55.079> temporarily<00:01:55.619> steep<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:57.030> parts<00:01:57.570> of

astigmatism reduced and where we need it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.180 
astigmatism reduced and where we need it
to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:04.040> because<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.380> wound<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.920> be

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
way the we can manage the astigmatism is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.960 
way the we can manage the astigmatism is
with<00:02:21.360> laser<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> same<00:02:23.700> laser

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
with laser and this is the same laser

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.300 
with laser and this is the same laser
that<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.420> use<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:25.110> treatments<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.800> LASIK

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
that we use to do treatments with LASIK

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.570 
that we use to do treatments with LASIK
and<00:02:26.460> PRK<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:28.740> effective<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and PRK and it can be very effective and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.390 
and PRK and it can be very effective and
very<00:02:29.850> accurate<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:31.280> lowering<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
very accurate in lowering the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.510 
very accurate in lowering the
astigmatism<00:02:33.530> because<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.740> smooths<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
astigmatism because it smooths out the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.220 
astigmatism because it smooths out the
areas<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> laser<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.890> order<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
areas using the laser in order to get it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.730 
areas using the laser in order to get it
more<00:02:40.230> round<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.810> careful<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
more round we have to be careful if the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.410 
more round we have to be careful if the
person<00:02:44.130> had<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> transplant<00:02:44.760> because<00:02:45.090> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
person had a transplant because of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
person had a transplant because of
keratoconus<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.440> other<00:02:46.650> diseases<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.490> cause

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
keratoconus or other diseases that cause

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
keratoconus or other diseases that cause
thinning<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> changes<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> cornea

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
thinning and changes in the cornea

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.340 
thinning and changes in the cornea
because<00:02:50.790> by<00:02:51.120> thinning<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.690> cornea<00:02:52.020> further

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
because by thinning the cornea further

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.070 
because by thinning the cornea further
with<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> laser<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.510> put<00:02:54.690> them<00:02:54.810> at<00:02:54.900> higher

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
with a laser it can put them at higher

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.660 
with a laser it can put them at higher
risk<00:02:55.410> possibly<00:02:56.960> also<00:02:58.070> when<00:02:59.070> we're<00:02:59.250> using<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
risk possibly also when we're using a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.300 
risk possibly also when we're using a
laser<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.630> always<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.170> about<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:03.300> accuracy

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
laser we always think about the accuracy

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.770 
laser we always think about the accuracy
from<00:03:05.310> using<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.640> laser<00:03:05.820> because<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.630> be

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
from using the laser because it can be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.530 
from using the laser because it can be
more<00:03:07.260> accurate<00:03:07.800> than<00:03:08.490> other<00:03:09.000> ways<00:03:09.270> of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
more accurate than other ways of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.590 
more accurate than other ways of
reducing<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.170> stigmatism<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.820> if<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.570> a
