is<00:01:27.790> completely<00:01:28.180> different<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.750> gearbox

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
is completely different the gearbox

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.200 
is completely different the gearbox
itself<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.830> obviously<00:01:30.400> it's<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.670> paddle<00:01:30.970> shift

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
up here the driver just basically it's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.800

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
up or down sequential gearbox so then

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.060

that's<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.200> quite<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> bit<00:01:35.710> different<00:01:35.830> to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
that's that's quite a bit different to
