this game bar none period it is the best
at<00:01:51.689> getting<00:01:51.950> interceptions<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> you're

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
at getting interceptions and you're

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490

mostly<00:01:58.229> games<00:01:58.439> against<00:01:58.829> other<00:01:59.040> users<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
mostly games against other users and I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.090 
mostly games against other users and I
think<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.079> part<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> reason<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
think that's part of the reason that it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.709 
think that's part of the reason that it
was<00:02:02.130> tough<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.520> me<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.149> get

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
was tough for me to actually get

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
was tough for me to actually get
highlights<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> wasn't<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.670> Calvin

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
highlights and it wasn't that Calvin

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
highlights and it wasn't that Calvin
wasn't<00:02:06.390> making<00:02:06.659> plays<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.110> was<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
wasn't making plays it was just that you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.309 
wasn't making plays it was just that you
know<00:02:08.399> when<00:02:08.910> other<00:02:09.060> players<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.539> what<00:02:10.170> you're

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
know when other players know what you're

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.690 
know when other players know what you're
doing<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.220> you've<00:02:11.370> got<00:02:11.520> these

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
doing they know that you've got these

gameplay<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.840> saw<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.470> was

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
gameplay but as you saw there that was

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.830 
gameplay but as you saw there that was
an<00:02:16.740> example<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.430> 96<00:02:18.090> hit<00:02:18.300> power<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
an example of that 96 hit power that I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
an example of that 96 hit power that I
was<00:02:18.990> talking<00:02:19.380> about<00:02:19.470> he<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.310> laid<00:02:20.520> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
was talking about he just laid the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.450 
was talking about he just laid the
freaking<00:02:21.150> wood<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.050> poor<00:02:22.260> guy<00:02:22.470> forced<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
freaking wood on that poor guy forced a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.890 
freaking wood on that poor guy forced a
fumble<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.210> were<00:02:24.330> able<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> pick<00:02:24.780> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
fumble and then we were able to pick it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.980 
fumble and then we were able to pick it
up<00:02:25.020> now<00:02:25.530> watch<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.040> interception<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.510> I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
up now watch this interception because I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.060 
up now watch this interception because I
thought<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.590> was<00:02:28.740> one<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
thought that this was one of the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.770 
thought that this was one of the
craziest<00:02:29.490> picks<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> I've<00:02:30.060> seen<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
craziest picks that I've seen in this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
craziest picks that I've seen in this
game<00:02:30.990> period<00:02:31.410> he's<00:02:32.010> got<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> guy<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.610> across

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
game period he's got a guy going across

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.210 
game period he's got a guy going across
the<00:02:33.120> middle<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> look<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.110> he<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:34.920> lays

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the middle and look at that he just lays

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.800 
the middle and look at that he just lays
out<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:35.760> Superman<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.660> that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
out like Superman to get that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
out like Superman to get that
interception<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:38.160> damn<00:02:38.400> near<00:02:38.430> actually

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
interception and I damn near actually

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.700 
interception and I damn near actually
returned<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.540> thing<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.840> barely<00:02:40.140> got<00:02:40.350> taken

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
returned this thing I barely got taken

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.200 
returned this thing I barely got taken
down<00:02:40.830> from<00:02:41.010> behind<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
down from behind but that was a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.420 
down from behind but that was a
ridiculous<00:02:42.870> pick<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.410> was<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> user<00:02:43.890> pick<00:02:44.160> all

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
ridiculous pick that was a user pick all

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.280 
ridiculous pick that was a user pick all
the<00:02:44.670> way<00:02:44.790> now<00:02:45.300> here's<00:02:45.540> another<00:02:45.600> example<00:02:45.870> of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the way now here's another example of

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.950 
the way now here's another example of
this<00:02:46.440> hit<00:02:46.680> power<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.700> he<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.240> destroys

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
this hit power is he just destroys

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.950 
this hit power is he just destroys
DeMarco<00:02:49.590> Murray<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.480> happened

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
DeMarco Murray and you know it happened

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.110

think<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.680> best<00:03:19.890> free<00:03:20.250> safety<00:03:20.790> in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
think this is the best free safety in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.110 
think this is the best free safety in
the<00:03:21.120> game<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:22.100> my<00:03:23.100> honest<00:03:23.490> opinion<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.060> that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the game and my honest opinion is that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.420 
the game and my honest opinion is that
it<00:03:24.420> totally<00:03:24.870> depends<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:25.530> your<00:03:25.860> individual

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it totally depends on your individual

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.560 
it totally depends on your individual
playing<00:03:26.760> style<00:03:27.200> because<00:03:28.610> although<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:30.240> card

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
playing style because although this card

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.770 
playing style because although this card
is<00:03:30.920> incredibly<00:03:31.920> incredibly<00:03:32.280> good<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.750> use

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
is incredibly incredibly good if you use

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.160 
is incredibly incredibly good if you use
or<00:03:34.200> control<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.770> it's<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.970> quite<00:03:36.480> as<00:03:36.690> good<00:03:36.900> if

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
or control it it's not quite as good if

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
or control it it's not quite as good if
you<00:03:37.500> allow<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.890> computer<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.460> control<00:03:38.700> it

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
you allow the computer to control it

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.280 
you allow the computer to control it
because<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.360> saw<00:03:39.540> those<00:03:39.750> things<00:03:40.020> like<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
because you saw those things like the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.620 
because you saw those things like the
man<00:03:40.950> coverage<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.670> zone<00:03:41.910> coverage<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
man coverage in the zone coverage and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.360 
man coverage in the zone coverage and
although<00:03:42.930> they're<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.230> terrible<00:03:43.890> they're

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
although they're not terrible they're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.570 
although they're not terrible they're
not<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.730> good<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:46.130> when<00:03:47.130> your<00:03:47.310> user

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
not that good and so when your user

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.190 
not that good and so when your user
controlling<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.720> really<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.050> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
controlling it you don't really have to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.990 
controlling it you don't really have to
worry<00:03:49.350> about<00:03:49.470> play<00:03:49.770> recognition<00:03:50.430> awareness

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
worry about play recognition awareness

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.120
