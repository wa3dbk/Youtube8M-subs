00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.829
 hello friends there was once a circus a 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.530
 circus of children a poor circus in a country 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:15.789
 poor so poor was the circus that the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.289
 children had nothing but mattresses 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 I was lucky to be the director 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 artistic of this circus we get 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.190
 the clubs and some balls to make 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 juggling we get a unicycle 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.989
 we get an organ that does not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.720
 They sounded several keys and that's all 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.090
 we got but we had something more 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 important that we all had the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 enthusiasm and the strength of the group and 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.790
 when you propose it, you can get 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
 many things so we 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.640
 We proposed to have our own show and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940
 we started to work 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 We use songs choreographies 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.370
 simple some poems and some 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.949
 texts to build a story a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.790
 argument for our show and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.340
 we use circus disciplines 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.390
 that required us to team like 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.430
 acrobatics pyramids contortion 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 human 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.510
 little by little we managed to create our 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 show that lasted more than an hour 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.600
 we started doing it for the colleges 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.940
 We started traveling and doing it for the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 squares of the towns by fields of 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.660
 soccer and little by little other children other 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.229
 schools that had less even than 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 we were inspired and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.580
 they started to create similar groups of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 circus and so we ended up traveling almost 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320
 All national television wine country 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 in recorded the show and that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 show ended up being the show 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.320
 most seen in the history of that country 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.729
 almost everything you propose almost everything 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.489
 you can get it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.440
 in these Saturdays that you already know that in 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.480
 this channel is a day of performance in the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.610
 next saturdays saturdays I will share 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.530
 with you some of the exercises 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.379
 what we did in the circus some of the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.590
 human pyramids so that if you want 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.780
 try them with your friends 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.750
 you propose them at school in your club 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.209
 sporting some of the things that you're going to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.220
 see are relatively easy to do 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.549
 easy, you're just going to need some 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.129
 mats to practice the others 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.349
 Care maybe you need the help of 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.120
 a professional and support team 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.890
 security that we never had 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.730
 bone with caution caution but 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.730
