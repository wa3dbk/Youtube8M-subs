00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.660
 I really, really appreciate because 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 gain lazy ass trade guys 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.430
 now my location in the kitchen 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.940
 I'll just tell you, we will be with you 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.309
 do 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.500
 pie pie it said very loudly 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.409
 let's say less your cookies for 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 which is on parade today 11 minutes is 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.100
 depends on how much you spend 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.870
 time on the dough this code was starting 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.570
 as a school year for me is very very 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.850
 thrifty in terms of ancient because 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.549
 You already have vodka before 10, but you are late 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.229
 to do and not to taste it 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.600
 preparing was very little time I found 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.369
 such action is a recipe all year 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 helped a lot to stay 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.690
 at the time with this ingredient which is in this 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.690
 I always don't seem to have a cake 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.760
 at home let's get down to business today 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 our culinary program derpi videos 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.540
 on the first 20 peaceful one egg will like 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.130
 5 tablespoons of flour in local glasses for us 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.810
 Amount I usually do not even measure 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.450
 the main thing is that the dough is liquid 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.160
 then we need cocoa to taste too 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.070
 depending on how much you want to 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.070
 turned out chocolate sugar 4 spoons 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.220
 also principle instead you can 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.440
 use soda no these tears 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.900
 overdoing the taste is obtained and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.150
 they are exactly and yes let's start here 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.040
 ingredients face sunset said ida and 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.650
 whether it is quality to live in general here is ours 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 cup clean look for fairy tales on clear 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.540
 Of course, I never arrange it all 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.850
 In this already 30 are calculated on accepted 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.820
 you need to do 20 minutes at first everything was 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.100
 understand slowly put everything why 4 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:40.100
 spoon flour or a professional is not a cook 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 so what goes up what 235 spoons and 1 evil 2 and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 2 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.000
 it looked 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:07.120
 sensors 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:10.080
 put eggs and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 and decide 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.890
 I 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.320
 yes how am I doing everything neatly not me 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.840
 polish him not very tasty very 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.610
 but they still have life and guys 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.590
 saw something in the camera 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.050
 stopped and you didn't see that period 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.990
 if you add cocoa at your discretion and 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.240
 milk there as I said just repaired 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.490
 shepard usually cocoa as much as I 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.800
 I wanted that is, difficult noise 3 to buy 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.750
 hero was chocolate which added too 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.400
 just how much should the dough do 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.590
 get the error was not lumps I 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.670
 I'll use the whisk in this 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.670
 it turned out important 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.350
 winter 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.290
 you 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.789
