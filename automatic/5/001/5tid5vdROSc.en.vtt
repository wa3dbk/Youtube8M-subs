um I think that's the cool part with

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.970 
um I think that's the cool part with
Eldora<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:03.060> mean<00:00:03.419> obviously<00:00:03.540> some<00:00:04.020> guys<00:00:04.200> don't

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
Eldora I mean obviously some guys don't

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.710 
Eldora I mean obviously some guys don't
go<00:00:05.130> through<00:00:05.430> as<00:00:05.520> much<00:00:05.700> bad<00:00:05.970> luck<00:00:06.000> as<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.480> have

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
go through as much bad luck as I have

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.120 
go through as much bad luck as I have
there<00:00:06.930> but<00:00:07.080> I've<00:00:07.200> also<00:00:07.350> had<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.620> lot<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.859> good

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
there but I've also had a lot of good

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
there but I've also had a lot of good
luck<00:00:08.309> there<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:10.340> in<00:00:11.340> racing<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.570> always<00:00:12.780> think

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
luck there so in racing you always think

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.740 
luck there so in racing you always think
about<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.380> good<00:00:13.880> not<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.150> much<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> bag

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
about the good not as much the bag

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
about the good not as much the bag
because<00:00:15.990> normally<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.470> racing<00:00:16.830> there's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> lot

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
because normally in racing there's a lot

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.230 
because normally in racing there's a lot
more<00:00:17.460> bad<00:00:17.730> than<00:00:17.760> good

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
more bad than good

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.230 
more bad than good
I<00:00:18.420> mean<00:00:18.660> I've<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> series<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.910> hundred

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I mean I've out of a series of a hundred

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
I mean I've out of a series of a hundred
races<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.930> 70<00:00:22.320> races<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> you're<00:00:22.980> lucky

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
races or 70 races and you're lucky

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
races or 70 races and you're lucky
enough<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.550> win<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.600> five<00:00:25.019> or<00:00:25.380> ten<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:25.800> 15

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
enough to win one or five or ten or 15

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.230 
enough to win one or five or ten or 15
you<00:00:27.180> lose<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.900> than<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.230> win<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.490> look

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you lose more than you win so I look

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.260 
you lose more than you win so I look
forward<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.890> highlights<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> Eldora<00:00:33.120> or

not<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> downfalls<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.710> I've

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
not the the downfalls but I've

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
not the the downfalls but I've
definitely<00:00:35.040> had<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.550> share<00:00:35.880> bad<00:00:36.300> luck<00:00:36.630> there

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.430 
definitely had my share bad luck there
and<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:38.750> definitely<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.050> paid<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.379> dues

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.530 
but I think when you get hurt you just
you<00:03:06.130> can't<00:03:06.430> ever<00:03:06.580> think<00:03:06.910> you're<00:03:07.240> just<00:03:07.420> never

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
here racing but I mean I think I thought

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.410 
here racing but I mean I think I thought
to<00:03:11.590> myself<00:03:11.770> first<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.910> was<00:03:13.030> never<00:03:13.270> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
to myself first it was never the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.170 
to myself first it was never the
championship<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.100> never<00:03:15.340> anything<00:03:15.850> other

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
championship it was never anything other

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.229 
championship it was never anything other
than

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
than

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.600 
than
and<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.810> really<00:03:18.110> miss<00:03:18.290> racing<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.099> I<00:03:19.220> want<00:03:19.489> to

and I really miss racing and I want to
race<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.569> then<00:03:20.810> once<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.290> realize<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.890> then

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
race and then once you realize that then

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.679 
race and then once you realize that then
you<00:03:22.189> can<00:03:22.340> go<00:03:22.459> out<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.640> win<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.510> then

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
you can go out and win and then

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:24.850 
you can go out and win and then
hopefully<00:03:23.900> then<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.319> can<00:03:24.470> go<00:03:24.560> out<00:03:24.650> win<00:03:24.829> a

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
hopefully then you can go out win a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.259 
hopefully then you can go out win a
championship<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.640> think<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:25.939> have<00:03:26.150> to

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
championship but I think you have to

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.539 
championship but I think you have to
realize<00:03:26.629> how<00:03:27.290> important<00:03:27.769> racing<00:03:28.159> is<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
realize how important racing is to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.039 
realize how important racing is to
personally<00:03:29.150> before<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.659> go<00:03:29.750> out<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:29.959> do

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
personally before you can go out and do

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.420 
personally before you can go out and do
anything<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.980> think<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.220> was<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
anything and I think that was the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.530 
anything and I think that was the
biggest<00:03:31.610> thing<00:03:31.790> I've<00:03:31.909> learned<00:03:32.090> from<00:03:32.180> all<00:03:32.390> my

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
biggest thing I've learned from all my

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.899 
biggest thing I've learned from all my
accidents<00:03:33.140> because<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:34.129> really<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:34.609> missed

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
accidents because I really just missed

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.979 
accidents because I really just missed
racing<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.659> wanted<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.260> race<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:38.810> think

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
racing I wanted to race so I think

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.569 
racing I wanted to race so I think
that's<00:03:39.319> why<00:03:39.439> I<00:03:39.470> worked<00:03:39.769> so<00:03:39.950> hard<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.220> get<00:03:40.370> back

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
that's why I worked so hard to get back

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.250 
that's why I worked so hard to get back
out<00:03:40.879> when<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.150> broke<00:03:41.390> my<00:03:41.540> hand<00:03:41.689> we<00:03:41.959> were<00:03:42.079> racing

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.979 
out when I broke my hand we were racing
the<00:03:42.530> next<00:03:42.829> week<00:03:43.010> couldn't<00:03:43.310> even<00:03:43.430> do<00:03:43.549> my

the next week couldn't even do my

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.449 
the next week couldn't even do my
