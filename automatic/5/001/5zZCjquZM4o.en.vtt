00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
about shade how much traffic the lawn is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
about shade how much traffic the lawn is
going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.150> have<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.629> much<00:00:33.750> wind<00:00:34.080> along<00:00:34.379> going

to have and how much water's available
to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> lawn<00:00:36.660> once<00:00:37.080> we<00:00:37.290> pick<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.890> seed

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to the lawn once we pick the right seed

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
to the lawn once we pick the right seed
we<00:00:38.340> want<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:38.970> seed<00:00:39.420> bed<00:00:39.720> here

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
we want to think about seed bed here

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
we want to think about seed bed here
we're<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.649> patching<00:00:41.309> along<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.630> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we're just patching along so we want to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.920 
we're just patching along so we want to
work<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.079> seed<00:00:43.380> bed<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.250> bit<00:00:44.930> so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
work that seed bed up a little bit so

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.790 
work that seed bed up a little bit so
that<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:47.670> plant<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.360> seed<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.559> try<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that as we plant this seed we can try to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670 
that as we plant this seed we can try to
get<00:00:50.040> all<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> seed<00:00:51.030> covered<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
get all of the seed covered with about a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
get all of the seed covered with about a
quarter<00:00:53.039> inch<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.610> soil<00:00:54.200> remember<00:00:55.200> these

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
quarter inch of soil remember these

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.529 
quarter inch of soil remember these
seeds<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:55.980> tiny<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.329> need

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
seeds are really tiny and they they need

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.799 
seeds are really tiny and they they need
soil<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.140> top<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:00.570> need

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
soil on top of them but they don't need

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.999 
soil on top of them but they don't need
a<00:01:01.020> lot<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> soil<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.680> we<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
a lot of soil so then we want to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.889 
a lot of soil so then we want to
remember<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.550> seed<00:01:05.789> is<00:01:05.940> evolved<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.630> growing

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
remember that seed is evolved by growing

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.230 
remember that seed is evolved by growing
up<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.380> footprint<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.009> buffalo<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
up in the footprint of a buffalo it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.010 
up in the footprint of a buffalo it
really<00:01:09.750> needs<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.350> firm<00:01:11.130> seed<00:01:11.550> bed<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.659> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really needs a firm seed bed we can use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
really needs a firm seed bed we can use
a<00:01:13.049> roller<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.580> simply<00:01:15.030> walk<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a roller but we can simply walk on it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.370 
a roller but we can simply walk on it
once<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.130> nice<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.729> firm<00:01:18.380> we're

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
once we get that nice and firm we're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.670 
once we get that nice and firm we're
then<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> add<00:01:20.100> some<00:01:20.430> organic<00:01:20.610> matter

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
then going to add some organic matter

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730 
then going to add some organic matter
here<00:01:22.680> I'll<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.430> peat<00:01:23.670> moss<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:25.110> top<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
here I'll put some peat moss on top of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.210 
here I'll put some peat moss on top of
this<00:01:25.830> seed<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.909> could<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.240> use<00:01:27.450> straw<00:01:28.220> least

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
this seed we could also use straw least

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
this seed we could also use straw least
leftover<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:29.970> last<00:01:30.240> year<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.750> organic

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
leftover from last year any organic

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830 
leftover from last year any organic
matter<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.460> organic<00:01:33.060> matters<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
matter that organic matters are going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.039 
matter that organic matters are going to
help<00:01:34.110> us<00:01:34.380> hold<00:01:34.680> moisture<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.720> for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> seed

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
help us hold moisture there for the seed

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.069 
help us hold moisture there for the seed
to<00:01:37.079> germinate<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.220> also<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.759> grow<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.960> now

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to germinate but also to grow so now

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
to germinate but also to grow so now
that<00:01:40.200> we've<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.530> organic<00:01:40.770> matter<00:01:41.340> down<00:01:41.640> we're

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that we've got organic matter down we're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
that we've got organic matter down we're
going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> water<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.070> we're<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> water

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
going to water that we're going to water

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
going to water that we're going to water
it<00:01:44.579> enough<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> seed<00:01:45.689> germinated

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it enough to get that seed germinated

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.530 
it enough to get that seed germinated
and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> remember<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and then what we're going to remember is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
and then what we're going to remember is
boy<00:01:48.750> once<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> grass<00:01:49.530> starts<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.070> grow<00:01:50.250> it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
boy once that grass starts to grow it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.480 
boy once that grass starts to grow it's
just<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.790> tiny<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.450> hair<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.799> once<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.310> get

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
just a tiny little hair so once we get

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600 
just a tiny little hair so once we get
that<00:01:53.729> watered<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.920> fill<00:01:56.369> our

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that watered we can actually fill our

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
that watered we can actually fill our
soil<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.180> organic<00:01:57.689> matter<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
soil in organic matter and we want it to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.940 
soil in organic matter and we want it to
feel<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.880> wrung<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.360> tau<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.649> Hudson

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
feel like a wrung out tau this is Hudson
