00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
personally find any good use out of this

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.889 
personally find any good use out of this
weapon<00:01:26.569> so<00:01:27.569> getting<00:01:28.200> started<00:01:29.329> there<00:01:30.329> my

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
weapon so getting started there my

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.020 
weapon so getting started there my
opinion<00:01:31.289> are<00:01:31.439> very<00:01:31.649> few<00:01:31.950> good<00:01:32.340> points<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
opinion are very few good points to it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.139 
opinion are very few good points to it
unless<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.960> consider<00:01:34.789> having<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.880> laugh<00:01:35.999> and

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
unless you consider having a laugh and

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.849 
unless you consider having a laugh and
that's<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.329> challenge<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.899> use<00:01:37.109> a<00:01:37.439> good<00:01:37.679> point

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
that's a challenge to use a good point

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.569 
that's a challenge to use a good point
and<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.329> personally<00:01:40.289> find<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.889> great

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and really I personally find that great

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.349 
and really I personally find that great
but<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.539> is<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.840> beyond<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.969> this<00:01:44.969> is<00:01:45.119> just

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
but this is just beyond me this is just

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.330 
but this is just beyond me this is just
way<00:01:45.569> beyond<00:01:45.990> me<00:01:46.490> now<00:01:47.899> this<00:01:48.899> weapon<00:01:49.259> has<00:01:49.560> zero

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
way beyond me now this weapon has zero

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.029 
way beyond me now this weapon has zero
range<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.569> by<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.929> mean<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.649> attached

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
range and by that I mean it's attached

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.440 
range and by that I mean it's attached
to<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.670> fist<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:55.350> has<00:01:55.590> no<00:01:55.770> range<00:01:56.329> you<00:01:57.329> know

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to your fist it has no range you know

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.239 
to your fist it has no range you know
that<00:01:57.749> whole<00:01:57.899> stereotype<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.649> weapon<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> an

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
that whole stereotype a weapon is an

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.550 
that whole stereotype a weapon is an
extension<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.850> your<00:01:59.969> arm<00:02:00.029> this<00:02:00.749> isn't<00:02:01.079> any<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
extension of your arm this isn't any of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.810 
extension of your arm this isn't any of
that<00:02:01.679> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.369> attached<00:02:02.639> to<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.969> face

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that this is attached to your face

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.400 
that this is attached to your face
none<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.420> applies<00:02:04.750> with<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.230> fist

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
none of that applies with the fist

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.610 
none of that applies with the fist
weapon<00:02:05.740> doesn't<00:02:06.340> matter<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:08.020> all<00:02:08.290> out<00:02:08.500> the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:08.620 
weapon doesn't matter that's all out the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.980 
weapon doesn't matter that's all out the
window<00:02:08.650> you<00:02:09.640> can't<00:02:09.880> predict<00:02:10.510> where<00:02:10.690> someone's

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
window you can't predict where someone's

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.470 
window you can't predict where someone's
going<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.680> swing<00:02:12.520> your<00:02:12.820> sword<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:13.360> that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
going and swing your sword in that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.260 
going and swing your sword in that
direction<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.860> hit<00:02:15.070> them<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:15.970> you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
direction and have it hit them now you

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.180 
direction and have it hit them now you
have<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.510> literally<00:02:17.110> chase<00:02:17.350> them<00:02:17.560> down<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.980> run

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
have to literally chase them down or run

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.860 
have to literally chase them down or run
there<00:02:18.400> before<00:02:18.760> they<00:02:18.880> do<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.060> if<00:02:19.300> they<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
there before they do it if they see you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.600 
there before they do it if they see you
running<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> direction<00:02:20.980> they're<00:02:21.250> gonna<00:02:21.370> run

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
running to a direction they're gonna run

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.820 
running to a direction they're gonna run
then<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.900> direction<00:02:23.290> anymore

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
then we're on that direction anymore

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.580 
then we're on that direction anymore
so<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.970> really<00:02:25.330> hard<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:25.960> people<00:02:26.230> with

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so it's really hard to get people with

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.820 
so it's really hard to get people with
attacks<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.970> you're<00:02:28.620> relying<00:02:29.620> at

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
attacks that you're relying at

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.040 
attacks that you're relying at
predictions<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:31.140> um<00:02:33.420> although<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:34.750> say

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
predictions for um although I will say

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.320 
predictions for um although I will say
it's<00:02:35.470> swing<00:02:35.800> speed<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.370> pretty<00:02:37.120> good

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
it's swing speed is pretty good

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
it's swing speed is pretty good
considering<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.990> your<00:02:38.320> punching<00:02:39.010> speed<00:02:39.490> I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
considering it's your punching speed I

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.960 
considering it's your punching speed I
mean<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.920> way<00:02:41.950> really<00:02:42.430> say<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.820> it's

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
mean all the way really say that it's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.520 
mean all the way really say that it's
the<00:02:43.180> speed<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.570> your<00:02:43.660> punch<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.110> pretty<00:02:44.350> good

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
the speed of your punch it's pretty good

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.200 
the speed of your punch it's pretty good
um<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.680> any<00:02:47.950> form<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.550> buff<00:02:48.820> I'm

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
um so that with any form of a buff I'm

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.490 
um so that with any form of a buff I'm
using<00:02:49.450> some<00:02:49.780> light<00:02:49.900> plate<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.350> make<00:02:50.440> it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
using some light plate to make it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500 
using some light plate to make it
somewhat<00:02:50.830> more<00:02:50.890> viable<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.610> here<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.240> actually

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
somewhat more viable and here I actually

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
somewhat more viable and here I actually
I<00:02:53.050> kind<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.800> went<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> little<00:02:54.130> bit<00:02:54.340> hallo<00:02:54.640> at

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I kind of went a little bit hallo at

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.460 
I kind of went a little bit hallo at
this<00:02:55.210> point<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:55.990> on<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.200> Hornet

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
this point so I put it on the Hornet

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.430 
this point so I put it on the Hornet
ring<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.430> was<00:02:57.610> dying<00:02:57.850> way<00:02:58.420> too<00:02:58.480> much

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
ring because I was dying way too much

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.750 
ring because I was dying way too much
like<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:01.450> was<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.960> was<00:03:02.110> awful<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.650> was<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.520> bad

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
like it was it was awful it was just bad

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.170 
like it was it was awful it was just bad
so<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.480> need<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> little<00:03:05.260> extra<00:03:05.670> extra<00:03:06.670> damage

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
so I need a little extra extra damage

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940 
so I need a little extra extra damage
because<00:03:07.420> some<00:03:08.050> light<00:03:08.230> blade<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:08.620> wasn't

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because some light blade just wasn't

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.600 
because some light blade just wasn't
enough<00:03:09.130> apparently

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.100 

if<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.760> can<00:03:12.910> put<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> buff<00:03:13.270> on<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.990> can

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
if you can put a buff on it you can

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.540 
if you can put a buff on it you can
actually<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.470> some<00:03:14.530> pretty<00:03:14.800> decent<00:03:15.130> damage

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
actually get some pretty decent damage

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.340 
actually get some pretty decent damage
out<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.330> your<00:03:16.540> regular<00:03:16.690> swings<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
out of just your regular swings just

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.620 
out of just your regular swings just
going<00:03:17.770> for<00:03:17.890> someone<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.370> mastering<00:03:19.000> r1<00:03:19.390> all

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
going for someone just mastering r1 all

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
going for someone just mastering r1 all
day<00:03:19.840> at<00:03:20.020> them<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.830> get<00:03:20.980> some<00:03:21.130> pretty<00:03:21.250> good

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
day at them you get some pretty good

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.830 
day at them you get some pretty good
damage<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.239> it's<00:03:22.360> pretty<00:03:22.600> fast

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
damage out of that and it's pretty fast

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.710 
damage out of that and it's pretty fast
I<00:03:23.760> most<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.910> times<00:03:25.120> when<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.360> did<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:25.660> was

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
I most of the times when I did it I was

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.020 
I most of the times when I did it I was
able<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.989> rack<00:03:26.560> up<00:03:26.590> about<00:03:27.010> 700<00:03:27.610> damage<00:03:27.730> on

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
able to rack up about 700 damage on

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.760 
able to rack up about 700 damage on
someone<00:03:28.330> before<00:03:28.450> they<00:03:28.690> noticed<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.650> was

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
someone before they noticed I was

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.040 
someone before they noticed I was
hitting<00:03:30.010> them<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.250> rolled<00:03:30.459> away<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.780> guess

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
hitting them and rolled away so I guess

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.030 
hitting them and rolled away so I guess
that<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.230> pretty<00:03:32.380> good

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
that is pretty good

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040 
that is pretty good
and<00:03:33.130> if<00:03:33.940> you're<00:03:34.150> flipping<00:03:34.330> around<00:03:34.570> with<00:03:34.930> this

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
and if you're flipping around with this

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.900 
and if you're flipping around with this
weapon<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.739> would<00:03:36.130> make<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.550> pretty

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
weapon that would make it pretty

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.110 
weapon that would make it pretty
obnoxious<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.590> dangerous

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
obnoxious and dangerous

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.110 
obnoxious and dangerous
one<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.170> main<00:03:42.620> cons<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:43.940> weapon

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
one of the main cons of this weapon

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.300 
one of the main cons of this weapon
aside<00:03:44.780> from<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.110> fact<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.470> has<00:03:45.650> zero<00:03:45.950> range

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
aside from the fact it has zero range

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.430 
aside from the fact it has zero range
because<00:03:46.819> that<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.270> main<00:03:47.420> one<00:03:47.599> but<00:03:48.140> another

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
because that is the main one but another

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.949 
because that is the main one but another
one<00:03:48.860> that's<00:03:49.069> really<00:03:49.550> not<00:03:49.880> helping<00:03:50.209> out<00:03:50.480> at<00:03:50.720> all

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
one that's really not helping out at all

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.030 
one that's really not helping out at all
is<00:03:52.360> low<00:03:53.360> damage<00:03:53.720> output<00:03:53.900> which<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.380> why<00:03:54.650> I'm<00:03:54.830> in

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
is low damage output which is why I'm in

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280 
is low damage output which is why I'm in
sunlight<00:03:55.370> blade<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.880> using<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.750> Horner<00:03:57.080> ring

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
sunlight blade and using the Horner ring

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.970 
sunlight blade and using the Horner ring
because<00:03:58.010> even<00:03:59.000> with<00:03:59.330> both<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.900> those<00:04:00.170> the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
because even with both of those the

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.710 
because even with both of those the
damage<00:04:01.250> output<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:01.819> poor<00:04:02.150> on<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:02.510> thing

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
damage output is so poor on this thing

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.229 
damage output is so poor on this thing
it's<00:04:03.019> just<00:04:03.290> ridiculous<00:04:04.209> um<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.860> for<00:04:07.250> pros<00:04:07.550> we

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
it's just ridiculous um so for pros we

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.120 
it's just ridiculous um so for pros we
have<00:04:08.510> its<00:04:09.410> fast<00:04:09.890> punch<00:04:10.430> speed<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.890> it's<00:04:12.890> good

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
have its fast punch speed and it's good

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.830 
have its fast punch speed and it's good
in<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.280> situation<00:04:13.459> where<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.299> person<00:04:14.630> has

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
in the situation where the person has

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.879 
in the situation where the person has
very<00:04:15.230> little<00:04:15.410> poise<00:04:16.180> now<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.239> cons<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:18.680> have

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
very little poise now the cons you have

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.759 
very little poise now the cons you have
no<00:04:19.160> rain<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:20.120> lobe<00:04:20.600> damage<00:04:20.959> if<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.590> have

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
no rain you have lobe damage if you have

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.070 
no rain you have lobe damage if you have
a<00:04:21.799> high<00:04:22.130> weight<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.610> thing<00:04:22.790> weighs<00:04:23.030> 10<00:04:23.419> units

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
a high weight this thing weighs 10 units

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.190 
a high weight this thing weighs 10 units
of<00:04:24.260> whatever<00:04:24.729> weighs<00:04:25.729> 10<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.750> ridiculous

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
of whatever weighs 10 that's ridiculous

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.770 
of whatever weighs 10 that's ridiculous
for<00:04:27.560> our<00:04:27.650> fist<00:04:27.830> weapon<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.250> has<00:04:28.430> this<00:04:29.120> little

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
for our fist weapon that has this little

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.550 
for our fist weapon that has this little
damage<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.500> mean<00:04:31.280> that's<00:04:31.780> that's<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:32.840> bad<00:04:33.139> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560
