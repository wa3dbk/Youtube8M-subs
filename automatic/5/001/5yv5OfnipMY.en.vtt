00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
back here that's because I don't have

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.279 
back here that's because I don't have
anywhere<00:00:32.360> better<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.780> put<00:00:32.989> him

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.250 
thought of all kinds of places to put
him<00:00:39.260> but<00:00:39.980> he<00:00:40.730> doesn't<00:00:40.909> fit<00:00:41.300> anywhere<00:00:41.690> he's<00:00:42.019> too

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
him but he doesn't fit anywhere he's too

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.009 
him but he doesn't fit anywhere he's too
long<00:00:42.499> and<00:00:42.829> those<00:00:43.579> bolts<00:00:44.089> stick<00:00:44.329> out<00:00:44.510> too<00:00:44.749> far

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
long and those bolts stick out too far

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.169 
long and those bolts stick out too far
and<00:00:45.260> I'm<00:00:45.440> constantly<00:00:46.010> ripping<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:46.550> legs<00:00:46.789> open

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
if you take a look at the bottom there's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.150 
if you take a look at the bottom there's
a<00:01:10.430> lot<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.730> wasted<00:01:11.120> space<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.710> really

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
a lot of wasted space and in a really

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.070 
a lot of wasted space and in a really
tiny<00:01:13.370> little<00:01:13.640> woodshop<00:01:14.150> like<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.660> one<00:01:14.930> I

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
any space and the saw bench will be a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.990 
any space and the saw bench will be a
little<00:01:30.320> less<00:01:30.470> wobbly<00:01:31.040> because<00:01:31.280> he<00:01:31.670> likes<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
little less wobbly because he likes the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.760 
little less wobbly because he likes the
wobble<00:01:32.510> around<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.930> little<00:01:33.050> bit<00:01:33.290> when<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.500> put

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
wobble around a little bit when I put

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.860 
wobble around a little bit when I put
the<00:01:33.890> thickness<00:01:34.250> planer<00:01:34.550> on<00:01:34.820> him<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.090> shoot<00:01:35.690> my
