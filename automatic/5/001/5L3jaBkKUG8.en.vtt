00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.149
 with a lot of fire if I put my hands to 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.570
 7 burning for the matambre I put the 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 7 hands I say ah so hot that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.539
 and we're going to leave them for 5 or 6 7 minutes 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.239
 from one side to give after laps 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.239
 let's go down the grill 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.900
 that are cooked 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.910

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.450
 and what is your little 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.340
 that's the churrasquito 57 minutes good 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.610
 fire this is done when the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.610
 guests 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.380
 mom me 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.700
 that's so good 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.880
 these 5 minutes the second side is 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.750
 ready you do not have to dry it is a cut that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.340
 it is barbaric if seven minutes of a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.570
 side 57 of the other 8 15 minutes in total 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 is for lunch 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.970
 remember there we keep it good 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 fire all the time good time comes 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.770
 to start presenting then we are going to 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.729
 present our sirloin recipes for 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.729
 the recipes sirloins 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.200
 there it is going to go removing them it is cut 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.580
 last moment before taking it to the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.890
 table 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.010
 if you cut meat grilled not 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.990
 it matters what meat is a good time before 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.110
 the problem is that it cools and dries 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.450
 too much if it's to share plate 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.800
 unique is to say the only dish we're going 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.430
 to do 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.200
 is these are the same fillers 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.970
 shared between two people I'll 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.250
 I would say cuts in half because 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.220
 the slices so good if you are going to taste 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.830
 many people but it makes the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.740
 meat and other long as the piece 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.450
 more whole comes to the table better 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.450

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.060
