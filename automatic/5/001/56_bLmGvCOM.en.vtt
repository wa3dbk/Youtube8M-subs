there's<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.559> area<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.250> run<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.820> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
there's one area that we run in out to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.749 
there's one area that we run in out to
it<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> problem<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> do<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
it really is a problem we have to do a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
it really is a problem we have to do a
lot<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.969> education<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> overcome<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
lot of education to overcome but the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.019 
lot of education to overcome but the
average<00:00:16.800> person<00:00:17.220> thinks<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> bigger<00:00:17.850> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
average person thinks that bigger is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.810 
average person thinks that bigger is
better<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> good<00:00:19.619> two<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.279> excellent

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
better if one is good two is excellent

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.689 
better if one is good two is excellent
but<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> place<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.289> does<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.740> work<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
but the place that does not work is in

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
but the place that does not work is in
air<00:00:23.880> conditioning<00:00:24.420> bigger<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.410> better

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
air conditioning bigger is not better

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.519 
air conditioning bigger is not better
and<00:00:26.160> there's<00:00:26.279> three<00:00:26.609> big<00:00:26.939> reasons<00:00:27.150> why<00:00:27.529> number

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and there's three big reasons why number
