literally if you want to go on like a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
literally if you want to go on like a
massive<00:01:00.480> police<00:01:00.989> killing<00:01:01.469> streak<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.399> just

is<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:04.769> good<00:01:05.070> place<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.489> they

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
is a pretty good place because they

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
is a pretty good place because they
don't<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.080> they

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
can't kill you I've never been killed in

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
can't kill you I've never been killed in
this<00:01:09.420> spot<00:01:09.659> even<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> sky<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
this spot even from the sky from the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.929 
this spot even from the sky from the
helicopters<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.310> everything<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
helicopters and everything like that so

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
helicopters and everything like that so
it<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
it is pretty good if you want to do that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
it is pretty good if you want to do that
it<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.479> relatively<00:01:15.960> easy<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.590> lose<00:01:16.710> your

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it is also relatively easy to lose your

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
it is also relatively easy to lose your
wanted<00:01:17.189> level<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.790> need<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.180> wait

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
wanted level you just need to just wait

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
wanted level you just need to just wait
there<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.200> wait<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.890> kill<00:01:20.070> anyone

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there and wait it out or not kill anyone

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
there and wait it out or not kill anyone
you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.729> lose<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> straight<00:01:21.210> away<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> there

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you can lose it straight away and there

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.090 
you can lose it straight away and there
is<00:01:21.780> obviously<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.290> limited<00:01:22.680> amount<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.040> space

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
is obviously a limited amount of space

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
is obviously a limited amount of space
each<00:01:23.520> walk<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> can't<00:01:24.270> walk<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.229> there's

and in regards to building up a wanted

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.530 
and in regards to building up a wanted
level<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:46.920> really<00:02:47.459> fast<00:02:47.700> even<00:02:48.239> faster<00:02:48.359> than
