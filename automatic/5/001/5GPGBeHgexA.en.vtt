so<00:00:27.280> let's<00:00:27.460> take<00:00:27.700> a<00:00:27.730> look<00:00:27.940> at<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.330> core

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
so let's take a look at the core

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.830 
so let's take a look at the core
progression<00:00:29.890> for<00:00:30.130> señorita<00:00:30.580> so<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.540> baseline

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
progression for señorita so the baseline

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:45.240 
progression for señorita so the baseline
is<00:00:32.110> pretty<00:00:32.470> simple<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.100> right

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
is pretty simple and then in the right

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.660 
is pretty simple and then in the right
hand<00:00:47.880> start<00:00:49.470> with<00:00:50.470> this<00:00:50.650> diminished<00:00:51.280> seven

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
hand start with this diminished seven

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.190 
hand start with this diminished seven
chord<00:00:53.370> stack<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.550> minor<00:00:54.790> thirds<00:00:55.120> built<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.690> D

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
chord stack of minor thirds built of D

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.150 
chord stack of minor thirds built of D
and<00:00:57.540> if<00:00:58.540> we<00:00:58.750> include<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.200> bass<00:00:59.410> note<00:00:59.710> this<00:00:59.980> is

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
and if we include the bass note this is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.670 
and if we include the bass note this is
outlining<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:01.000> B<00:01:01.240> flat<00:01:01.480> dominant<00:01:02.020> seven<00:01:02.650> chord

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
outlining a B flat dominant seven chord

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.600 
outlining a B flat dominant seven chord
with<00:01:03.490> a<00:01:03.520> flat<00:01:03.880> line<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.590> second<00:01:09.340> chord

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
with a flat line and then second chord

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.190 
with a flat line and then second chord
is<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.800> basically<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.400> b-flat

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
is this it's basically a b-flat

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240 
is this it's basically a b-flat
augmented<00:01:14.200> chord

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.360 

third<00:01:18.790> chord<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.780> B<00:01:20.350> flat<00:01:20.590> dominant<00:01:20.800> seven

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
third chord is a B flat dominant seven

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:33.360 
third chord is a B flat dominant seven
chord<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.970> go<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.500> fourth<00:01:29.830> chord<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.530> B<00:01:33.010> flat

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
chord so go the fourth chord is a B flat

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:42.950 
chord so go the fourth chord is a B flat
dominant<00:01:33.820> seven<00:01:34.420> chord<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> sharp<00:01:35.950> five

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.520 

fifth<00:01:43.960> chord<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.979> an<00:01:45.280> E<00:01:45.430> flat<00:01:45.610> minor<00:01:45.910> nine

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530 

and<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.160> have<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> same<00:01:53.610> chord<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and we have the same chord but the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.580 
and we have the same chord but the
b-flat<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.500> bass

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.100 

which<00:01:59.590> makes<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:01.290> G<00:02:02.290> flat<00:02:02.590> major<00:02:03.250> chord<00:02:03.460> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
which makes it a G flat major chord in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.990 
which makes it a G flat major chord in
first<00:02:05.110> inversion<00:02:05.500> because<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.460> third<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.850> in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
first inversion because the third is in

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.820 
first inversion because the third is in
the<00:02:07.090> bass<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.290> bass<00:02:08.440> note<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.650> then<00:02:11.650> that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the bass and the bass note and then that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
the bass and the bass note and then that
chord<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.400> transposes<00:02:13.120> down<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.690> whole<00:02:14.470> step

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
chord just transposes down a whole step

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.140 
chord just transposes down a whole step
so<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> last<00:02:16.240> chord<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.690> progression<00:02:17.170> is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
so the last chord of the progression is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.540 
so the last chord of the progression is
an<00:02:19.150> E<00:02:19.600> major<00:02:19.990> chord<00:02:20.260> although<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.130> would<00:02:21.250> be

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
an E major chord although it would be

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.070 
an E major chord although it would be
correctly<00:02:22.210> spelt<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.750> f<00:02:23.380> flat<00:02:23.710> major<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.840> most

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
correctly spelt as f flat major but most

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.830 
correctly spelt as f flat major but most
people<00:02:26.380> aren't<00:02:26.500> interested<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.840> I'm

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
people aren't interested in that so I'm

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
people aren't interested in that so I'm
going<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.110> call<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.440> an<00:02:29.560> E<00:02:29.800> major<00:02:30.120> seven<00:02:31.120> chord

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
going to call it an E major seven chord

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.820 
going to call it an E major seven chord
in<00:02:31.750> first<00:02:32.440> inversion<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.590> chord

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
in first inversion so that chord

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:57.220 
in first inversion so that chord
progression<00:02:35.890> again<00:02:36.370> is

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.720 

you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.410> ripple<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.920> last<00:02:59.100> two<00:02:59.310> chords<00:02:59.550> as

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you can ripple the last two chords as

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.640 
you can ripple the last two chords as
well

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
