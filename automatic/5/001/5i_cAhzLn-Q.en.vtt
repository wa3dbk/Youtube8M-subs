00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
weight on there almost certainly have to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
weight on there almost certainly have to
upgrade<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> always<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.799> fish<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.400> this

light as witty as I can get away with so
you<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.470> fall<00:01:13.740> test<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.159> down<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> sea

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
you know all fall test it down the sea

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.700 
you know all fall test it down the sea
and<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:16.079> have<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> two<00:01:16.530> pound

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
test on with I got a glow-in-the-dark

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.270 
test on with I got a glow-in-the-dark
feed<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.609> this<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.969> green<00:01:21.119> Corky<00:01:21.600> there

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
feed and this little green Corky there

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.800 
feed and this little green Corky there
and<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.369> only<00:01:23.490> using<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.759> size<00:01:23.969> six<00:01:24.270> hook<00:01:24.539> a<00:01:24.689> lot

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and I'm only using a size six hook a lot

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.169 
and I'm only using a size six hook a lot
of<00:01:24.899> people<00:01:25.079> use<00:01:25.289> like<00:01:25.439> bigger<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.249> two<00:01:26.429> my

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
of people use like bigger one or two my

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.059 
of people use like bigger one or two my
thought<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.719> these<00:01:28.049> guys<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.289> plankton<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
thought is these guys are plankton and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.319 
thought is these guys are plankton and
krill<00:01:29.130> leaders<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:29.819> out<00:01:29.969> at<00:01:30.119> sea

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
krill leaders when they're out at sea

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.779 
krill leaders when they're out at sea
and<00:01:30.719> they<00:01:31.350> hit<00:01:31.499> beads<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> might<00:01:32.639> as<00:01:32.729> well

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
and they hit beads so you might as well

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.459 
and they hit beads so you might as well
make<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> hook<00:01:33.359> look<00:01:33.600> tasty<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.139> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
make the hook look tasty if you can I

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.319 
make the hook look tasty if you can I
mean<00:01:34.649> they<00:01:34.829> might<00:01:35.009> mistake<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.549> krill

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
mean they might mistake that for krill

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.550 
mean they might mistake that for krill
or<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.929> don't<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.139> why<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.439> would

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
or something I don't know why they would

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.889 
or something I don't know why they would
up<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.799> river<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> fish<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
up a river but I'm not a fish so I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.480 
up a river but I'm not a fish so I
couldn't<00:01:40.170> tell<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.499> but<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:40.950> my<00:01:41.189> theory

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
couldn't tell you but that's my theory

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.169 
couldn't tell you but that's my theory
anyway

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
anyway

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.609 
anyway
I'm<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.719> casting<00:01:43.109> a<00:01:43.139> little<00:01:43.289> bit<00:01:43.380> ahead<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I'm just casting a little bit ahead to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.929 
I'm just casting a little bit ahead to
me<00:01:43.740> into<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:44.009> current<00:01:44.340> letting<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> weight

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
me into the current letting the weight

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
me into the current letting the weight
bounce<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.679> well<00:01:46.679> it's<00:01:46.859> probably<00:01:47.009> about

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
bounce back well it's probably about

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.440 
bounce back well it's probably about
twenty

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
twenty

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.149

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
them that is a lot more just wear him

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.170 
them that is a lot more just wear him
down<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.830> wasn't<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.430> horsing<00:04:39.850> those<00:04:39.970> to

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
down I wasn't really horsing those to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.610 
down I wasn't really horsing those to
win<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.510> jumped<00:04:40.870> but<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.110> mean<00:04:41.320> now<00:04:41.470> I'm

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
win that jumped but I mean now I'm

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.310 
win that jumped but I mean now I'm
basically<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:42.160> trying<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.000> worm<00:04:43.240> down<00:04:43.570> very

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
basically just trying to worm down very

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.560 
basically just trying to worm down very
gradually<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.190> mean<00:04:45.790> also<00:04:45.940> let<00:04:46.150> him<00:04:46.240> sit<00:04:46.450> in<00:04:46.480> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
gradually I mean also let him sit in the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.910 
gradually I mean also let him sit in the
middle<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.900> river<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.410> little<00:04:47.680> pressure

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
middle the river with a little pressure

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.890 
middle the river with a little pressure
on<00:04:48.100> him<00:04:48.160> because<00:04:48.820> even<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:49.300> drains<00:04:49.660> their

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
on him because even that drains their

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.200 
on him because even that drains their
gas<00:04:50.080> tank<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.620> then<00:04:51.250> try<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.730> them<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:51.970> you
