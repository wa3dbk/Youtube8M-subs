I like I kind of made it to where the
little<00:02:23.170> designed<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:24.099> don't<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.459> if<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.610> can

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
see that the design it's like a little

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.620 
see that the design it's like a little
design<00:02:29.440> curve<00:02:30.010> I've<00:02:30.880> holed<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.300> over<00:02:31.480> so

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
design curve I've holed it over so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.830 
design curve I've holed it over so
that's<00:02:31.780> at<00:02:32.019> each<00:02:32.230> end<00:02:33.150> okay<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:34.660> you're

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
that's at each end okay and then you're

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:44.210 
that's at each end okay and then you're
gonna<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:36.239> sew<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.739> I'm<00:02:38.739> probably<00:02:38.980> gonna<00:02:39.580> use

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.300 

this<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:49.239> can't<00:02:49.510> see<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.930> eight<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:50.890> nine

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
this like you can't see it eight or nine

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.600 
this like you can't see it eight or nine
on<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.910> brother<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.190> zig<00:02:54.610> zag<00:02:54.690> kind<00:02:55.690> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
on a brother it's like a zig zag kind of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.229 
on a brother it's like a zig zag kind of
but<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.680> small<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.069> slide<00:03:00.459> probably

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239
