excited to be here yeah so what did you
build<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:23.760> got<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> glove<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.900> had<00:00:25.050> about

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
build here we got a glove we had about

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
build here we got a glove we had about
10<00:00:25.890> hours<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.220> build<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> idea<00:00:27.689> behind

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
10 hours to build it and the idea behind

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
10 hours to build it and the idea behind
this<00:00:28.109> glove<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.580> take<00:00:29.910> information

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
this glove is it can take information

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.830 
this glove is it can take information
from<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.929> computer<00:00:31.189> usually<00:00:32.840> virtual

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
from the computer usually virtual

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.569 
from the computer usually virtual
reality<00:00:34.260> systems<00:00:34.680> take<00:00:34.950> information<00:00:35.309> from

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
reality systems take information from

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.709 
reality systems take information from
the<00:00:35.790> user<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.090> put<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> into<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> computer

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the user and put it into the computer

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.690 
the user and put it into the computer
the<00:00:37.469> idea<00:00:37.710> behind<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> glove<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the idea behind this glove is it can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
the idea behind this glove is it can
take<00:00:38.730> information<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> computer

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
take information then from the computer

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
take information then from the computer
and<00:00:40.559> output<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> back<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> user

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and output it back to the user

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
and output it back to the user
I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> key

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I think that's the the key

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
I think that's the the key
differentiator<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> idea

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
differentiator that we have so the idea

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000 
differentiator that we have so the idea
is<00:00:45.690> sort<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> put<00:00:46.890> your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
is sort of that you you can put your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
is sort of that you you can put your
hand<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.460> glove<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.570> touch

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
hand in this glove and you can touch

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
hand in this glove and you can touch
things<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.680> three-dimensional<00:00:50.430> space<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
things in three-dimensional space in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
things in three-dimensional space in
virtual<00:00:51.539> reality<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.980> would

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
virtual reality so when you would

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
virtual reality so when you would
normally<00:00:53.579> feel<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> wouldn't<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
normally feel you know wouldn't you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
normally feel you know wouldn't you
normally<00:00:55.680> you'd<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.890> able<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> cut<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.670> real

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
normally you'd be able to cut in real

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.220 
normally you'd be able to cut in real
life<00:00:57.030> you'd<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.210> able<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> close<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:58.050> hand

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
life you'd be able to close your hand

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.510 
life you'd be able to close your hand
around<00:00:58.410> something<00:00:58.530> you'd<00:00:58.739> feel<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> sort<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
around something you'd feel the sort of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
around something you'd feel the sort of
tension<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.940> wouldn't<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.329> able<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> close

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
tension you wouldn't be able to close

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
tension you wouldn't be able to close
your<00:01:00.809> fist<00:01:01.020> anymore<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.800> wrapped

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
can see there's little fishing wires or

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
can see there's little fishing wires or
little<00:01:35.759> ropes<00:01:36.450> attached<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> different

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
little ropes attached to the different

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
little ropes attached to the different
fingers<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.070> another<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.180> back

fingers and another little thing back

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
fingers and another little thing back
here<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> pulls<00:01:40.079> back<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.070> dressed

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
here that pulls back when I'm dressed

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
here that pulls back when I'm dressed
around<00:01:41.729> something<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.329> give<00:01:42.479> me<00:01:42.600> tension<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
around something to give me tension and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.330 
around something to give me tension and
right<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.590> close<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.040> fingers

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
right now you can close your fingers

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
right now you can close your fingers
right<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> says<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.990> open

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
right now like it says if I'm in open

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.730 
right now like it says if I'm in open
space<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.159> close<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.460> hand<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.590> now

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
space I can just close my hand and now

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.880 
space I can just close my hand and now
as<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.130> approach<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:51.720> thing<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
as I approach this this thing in this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.090 
as I approach this this thing in this
virtual<00:01:53.130> object<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> space<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.500> forces<00:01:55.950> his

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
virtual object in space it forces his

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
virtual object in space it forces his
hand<00:01:56.310> open<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.780> over<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.020> he's

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
hand open so you can see over here he's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
hand open so you can see over here he's
got<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.740> depth<00:01:59.520> sensor<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
got a little depth sensor and so the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
got a little depth sensor and so the
closer<00:02:00.869> his<00:02:01.079> hand<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.159> if

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
closer his hand is to it it's as if

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
closer his hand is to it it's as if
there's<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.670> object<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> space<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.170> if

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
there's an object there in space so if

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.959 
there's an object there in space so if
you<00:02:04.350> hold<00:02:04.500> his<00:02:04.649> hand<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.430> it'll

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you hold his hand just like that it'll

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
you hold his hand just like that it'll
be<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.180> there's<00:02:06.360> something<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:07.079> invisible

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
be like there's something here invisible

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.219 
be like there's something here invisible
in<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.099> hand<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.330> ropes<00:02:09.629> prevent<00:02:10.110> my

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in my hand and my the ropes prevent my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.960 
in my hand and my the ropes prevent my
hand<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:11.039> gripping<00:02:11.400> any<00:02:11.520> closer

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
hand from actually gripping any closer

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
hand from actually gripping any closer
feels<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.020> they're<00:02:13.170> sexually

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
feels like they're sexually

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
feels like they're sexually
something<00:02:13.890> inside<00:02:14.099> by<00:02:14.489> hand<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:15.330> though

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
something inside by hand even though

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240 
something inside by hand even though
it's<00:02:15.569> just<00:02:15.750> virtual<00:02:15.989> reality<00:02:16.349> yeah<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.069> with

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's just virtual reality yeah and with

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820 
it's just virtual reality yeah and with
nothing<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> way<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:19.470> allows<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
nothing in the way it it allows you to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.500 
nothing in the way it it allows you to
close<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.160> eye<00:02:20.430> cannot<00:02:21.180> close<00:02:21.420> any<00:02:21.810> tighter

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
close your eye cannot close any tighter

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.820 
close your eye cannot close any tighter
three-dimensionality<00:02:24.510> no<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.709> really

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
three-dimensionality no this is really

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.270 
three-dimensionality no this is really
cool

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
cool

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.130

build it like it only took you a few
hours<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.209> build<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.540> yeah<00:02:31.519> well<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:32.790> had<00:02:32.910> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
hours to build this yeah well we had a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.750 
hours to build this yeah well we had a
team<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.209> six<00:02:34.080> people<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.459> had<00:02:35.580> some

team of six people and we had some

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.699 
team of six people and we had some
people<00:02:35.880> who<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.209> good<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.510> construction<00:02:36.959> some

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
people who are good at construction some

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.870 
people who are good at construction some
people<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.160> software<00:02:38.489> development

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
people are going to software development

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.270 
people are going to software development
some<00:02:39.239> people<00:02:39.450> are<00:02:39.510> good<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.950> hardware<00:02:40.950> control

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
some people are good at hardware control

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.199 
some people are good at hardware control
and<00:02:42.019> we<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.950> came<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.370> an<00:02:44.459> idea<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and we just came in with an idea and

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.390 
and we just came in with an idea and
then<00:02:45.959> we<00:02:46.850> just<00:02:47.850> executed<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.540> built<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.280> yes<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
then we just executed and built it yes I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.650 
then we just executed and built it yes I
mean<00:02:50.519> it's<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.180> thing<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.450> hacked

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
mean it's it's this thing is hacked

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
mean it's it's this thing is hacked
together<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:52.170> hot<00:02:52.769> glue<00:02:53.010> duct<00:02:53.640> tape<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.269> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
together with hot glue duct tape and and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.750 
together with hot glue duct tape and and
watering<00:02:55.470> lots<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.920> hot<00:02:56.100> glue<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.549> brain

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
watering lots of hot glue and the brain

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660 
watering lots of hot glue and the brain
is<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.299> Raspberry<00:02:57.780> Pi<00:02:57.840> running<00:02:58.410> Python<00:02:58.920> that's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
is a Raspberry Pi running Python that's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.880 
is a Raspberry Pi running Python that's
awesome<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.450> what<00:03:01.080> could<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.319> be<00:03:01.380> used<00:03:01.680> for

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
awesome so what could this be used for

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.020 
awesome so what could this be used for
like<00:03:02.010> what<00:03:02.130> kind<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.280> industries<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.880> just

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
like what kind of industries is just

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.910 
like what kind of industries is just
gonna<00:03:03.180> end<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.450> helping<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.230> think<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.799> two

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
gonna end up helping out I think the two

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.500 
gonna end up helping out I think the two
main<00:03:05.099> industries<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.670> we're<00:03:05.819> going<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.239> our

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
main industries that we're going for our

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
main industries that we're going for our
gaming<00:03:07.760> which<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.910> an<00:03:09.000> obvious<00:03:09.530> application

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
gaming which is an obvious application

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.370 
gaming which is an obvious application
allow<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.670> feel<00:03:11.910> objects<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.049> your<00:03:13.170> games

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
allow you to feel objects in your games

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.630 
allow you to feel objects in your games
and<00:03:14.150> possibly<00:03:15.150> medical<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.220> doctors

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
and possibly medical I know that doctors

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.150 
and possibly medical I know that doctors
sometimes<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.450> remote<00:03:18.750> surgeries<00:03:19.290> using

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
sometimes do remote surgeries using

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.310 
sometimes do remote surgeries using
robotics<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:21.180> could<00:03:21.329> let<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.959> doctor

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
robotics and this could let the doctor

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.979 
robotics and this could let the doctor
feel<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.250> veins<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> arteries<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
feel the veins or the arteries or the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.020 
feel the veins or the arteries or the
bones<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:26.040> he's<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.370> operating<00:03:26.910> on

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
bones that he's actually operating on

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.559 
bones that he's actually operating on
maybe<00:03:27.780> across<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> world<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.359> really

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
maybe across the world so this is really

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.509 
maybe across the world so this is really
cool<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.959> think<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.650> soon<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
cool to think of that in soon in the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.580 
cool to think of that in soon in the
future<00:03:32.819> in<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.690> video<00:03:34.019> game<00:03:34.200> when<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.440> go<00:03:34.530> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
future in a video game when you go to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.380 
future in a video game when you go to
pick<00:03:34.829> something<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.579> screen<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.239> could

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
pick something up on screen you could

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.750 
pick something up on screen you could
actually<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:37.319> know<00:03:37.410> feel<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.100> shape<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.489> yeah

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
actually you know feel the shape of yeah

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.270 
actually you know feel the shape of yeah
you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.120> feel<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.930> heft<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.530> sword<00:03:40.829> or<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
you can feel the heft of a sword or you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280 
you can feel the heft of a sword or you
know<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.519> dimensions<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.170> it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
know the dimensions of it and see if it

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.379 
know the dimensions of it and see if it
fits<00:03:43.319> right<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.069> hand<00:03:44.310> yes<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
fits right in your hand yes I think I

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.750 
fits right in your hand yes I think I
think<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.109> next<00:03:46.350> step<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.650> would<00:03:46.799> if<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.340> took

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
think the next step we would if we took

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.309 
think the next step we would if we took
it<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> next<00:03:48.120> step<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.660> actuate

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
it to the next step we would actuate

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.110 
it to the next step we would actuate
each<00:03:49.530> finger<00:03:49.829> individually<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
each finger individually so that you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.090 
each finger individually so that you
could<00:03:51.239> maybe<00:03:51.420> rub<00:03:52.079> your<00:03:52.200> hand<00:03:52.440> over<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.829> surface

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
could maybe rub your hand over a surface

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.840 
could maybe rub your hand over a surface
and<00:03:53.519> explore<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.569> in<00:03:54.750> space<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.519> think<00:03:56.730> that

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and explore it in space and I think that

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
and explore it in space and I think that
would<00:03:56.970> be<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> very<00:03:57.420> very<00:03:57.750> unique<00:03:57.959> feeling<00:03:58.410> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
would be a very very unique feeling and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.800 
would be a very very unique feeling and
for<00:03:59.190> doctors<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.730> imagine<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.239> must<00:04:00.720> be

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
for doctors that imagine it must be

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.979 
for doctors that imagine it must be
tough<00:04:01.079> but<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.380> know<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.730> surgery<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.329> the

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
tough but you know to do surgery in the

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.379 
tough but you know to do surgery in the
real<00:04:04.139> world<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.829> feel<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.579> reach

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
real world you can feel when you reach

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.940 
real world you can feel when you reach
something<00:04:06.690> that's<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.079> little<00:04:07.260> bit<00:04:07.380> tougher<00:04:07.560> so

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
something that's a little bit tougher so

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.160 
something that's a little bit tougher so
if<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.340> hit<00:04:08.459> make<00:04:08.639> a<00:04:08.670> muscle<00:04:09.030> or<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.049> know<00:04:10.139> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
if you hit make a muscle or you know a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
if you hit make a muscle or you know a
bone<00:04:10.470> or<00:04:10.500> something<00:04:10.709> but<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:11.549> you're<00:04:11.670> doing

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
bone or something but when you're doing

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.300 
bone or something but when you're doing
the<00:04:12.359> virtual<00:04:12.750> surgery<00:04:13.350> using<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.739> robot<00:04:14.100> you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the virtual surgery using a robot you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.830 
the virtual surgery using a robot you
might<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.819> wouldn't<00:04:15.030> get<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.269> same<00:04:15.510> sort<00:04:15.780> of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
might you wouldn't get that same sort of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.199 
might you wouldn't get that same sort of
haptic<00:04:16.019> feedback<00:04:16.169> yes<00:04:17.039> yes<00:04:17.340> exactly<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.060> with

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
haptic feedback yes yes exactly so with

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.219 
haptic feedback yes yes exactly so with
this<00:04:18.299> they<00:04:18.419> would<00:04:18.539> be<00:04:18.570> able<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.840> say<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.079> oh

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
this they would be able to say like oh

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.170 
this they would be able to say like oh
I'm<00:04:19.440> about<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.859> hit<00:04:20.160> something<00:04:20.400> harder<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.150> I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
I'm about to hit something harder and I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.149 
I'm about to hit something harder and I
don't<00:04:21.389> want<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.720> cut<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.109> can<00:04:22.320> pull<00:04:22.590> back<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
don't want to cut I can pull back and

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.890 
don't want to cut I can pull back and
tell<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.729> robot<00:04:23.849> not<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.390> do<00:04:24.510> that

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
tell the robot not to do that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.540 
tell the robot not to do that
you<00:04:25.050> know<00:04:25.199> the<00:04:25.350> oak<00:04:25.770> there's<00:04:26.100> there's

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
you know the oak there's there's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.330 
you know the oak there's there's
something<00:04:26.910> there<00:04:27.389> yeah<00:04:27.630> yeah<00:04:28.229> we<00:04:28.470> we<00:04:29.100> want<00:04:29.280> to

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
something there yeah yeah we we want to

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.290 
something there yeah yeah we we want to
augment<00:04:29.580> reality<00:04:29.790> through<00:04:30.509> touch<00:04:31.410> which<00:04:31.770> is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
augment reality through touch which is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.790 
augment reality through touch which is
something<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.449> Nature<00:04:33.810> has<00:04:33.930> taken<00:04:34.470> billions

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
something that Nature has taken billions

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.189 
something that Nature has taken billions
of<00:04:34.860> years<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.100> develop<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.610> our<00:04:35.729> brains<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.270> we

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
of years to develop in our brains and we

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.680 
of years to develop in our brains and we
can<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.919> tap<00:04:38.370> into<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:38.759> signal<00:04:39.180> I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
can if we can tap into that signal I

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.659 
can if we can tap into that signal I
think<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.199> can<00:04:40.320> be<00:04:40.350> very<00:04:40.590> powerful<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.460> so

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
think it can be very powerful and so

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.040 
think it can be very powerful and so
you're<00:04:41.789> gonna<00:04:41.910> keep<00:04:42.120> on<00:04:42.240> working<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:42.870> now

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
you're gonna keep on working on this now

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.379 
you're gonna keep on working on this now
that<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.289> hackathons<00:04:43.710> done<00:04:43.889> yeah<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.729> think<00:04:45.060> so

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
that the hackathons done yeah I think so

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.719 
that the hackathons done yeah I think so
I<00:04:45.720> think<00:04:45.900> we<00:04:46.229> we<00:04:46.800> were<00:04:46.860> kind<00:04:47.039> of<00:04:47.100> validated<00:04:47.490> by

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
I think we we were kind of validated by

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.490 
I think we we were kind of validated by
the<00:04:47.759> fact<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:48.389> won<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:48.900> people<00:04:49.380> were

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the fact that we won and people were

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.680 
the fact that we won and people were
very<00:04:49.620> interested<00:04:50.100> in<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.310> area<00:04:50.639> so<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.180> would

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
very interested in this area so I would

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.650 
very interested in this area so I would
like<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.960> definitely<00:04:52.229> explore<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.660> haptic

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
like to definitely explore the haptic

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.350 
like to definitely explore the haptic
world<00:04:55.350> more<00:04:55.740> yeah<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:56.759> mean<00:04:56.910> we<00:04:57.000> haven't<00:04:57.150> really

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
world more yeah I mean we haven't really

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.300 
world more yeah I mean we haven't really
heard<00:04:57.479> much<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:58.229> this<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.800> think<00:04:59.039> there's

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
heard much like this and I think there's

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.189 
heard much like this and I think there's
a<00:04:59.400> lot<00:04:59.580> of<00:04:59.630> probably<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.720> bunch<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.020> big

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
a lot of probably a bunch of the big

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.390 
a lot of probably a bunch of the big
game<00:05:01.410> companies<00:05:01.770> would<00:05:01.949> love<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.280> have

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
game companies would love to have

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.159 
game companies would love to have
someone<00:05:02.699> like<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.150> their<00:05:03.240> R&amp;D<00:05:03.389> labs<00:05:03.840> just

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
someone like you and their R&amp;D labs just

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.870 
someone like you and their R&amp;D labs just
thinking<00:05:04.440> about<00:05:04.500> what's<00:05:04.830> next<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.220> mean<00:05:05.370> if<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
thinking about what's next I mean if the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.340 
thinking about what's next I mean if the
Kinect<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.330> cool<00:05:06.600> but<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.870> can't<00:05:07.110> touch

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
Kinect is cool but you can't touch

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.080 
Kinect is cool but you can't touch
anything<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.130> Microsoft<00:05:08.580> Kinect<00:05:08.699> this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
anything in the Microsoft Kinect this

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.909 
anything in the Microsoft Kinect this
could<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.479> next<00:05:09.600> level<00:05:09.930> exactly<00:05:10.680> all<00:05:10.889> of

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
could be the next level exactly all of

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.010 
could be the next level exactly all of
the<00:05:11.160> systems<00:05:11.520> I've<00:05:11.669> seen<00:05:11.880> have<00:05:12.120> taken

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
the systems I've seen have taken

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.290 
the systems I've seen have taken
information<00:05:13.530> from<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.520> given<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.210> the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
information from you and given it to the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.110 
information from you and given it to the
computer<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:15.990> said<00:05:16.199> now<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.250> can<00:05:17.520> port<00:05:18.060> it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
computer like I said now we can port it

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.750 
computer like I said now we can port it
back<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.630> person<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.410> where<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:20.550> user

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
back to the person the where the user

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.600 
back to the person the where the user
very<00:05:21.510> cool<00:05:21.780> well<00:05:22.289> this<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.560> terminator<00:05:22.979> here
