here<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.290> are<00:00:04.319> with<00:00:04.560> an<00:00:04.680> unboxing<00:00:05.009> and

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
here we are with an unboxing and

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.210 
here we are with an unboxing and
demonstration<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.779> case-mate<00:00:07.259> smooth

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
demonstration of the case-mate smooth

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.089 
demonstration of the case-mate smooth
case<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.940> black<00:00:09.389> for<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.809> Sony<00:00:10.290> Xperia<00:00:10.849> S<00:00:12.080> so

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
case in black for the Sony Xperia S so

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.470 
case in black for the Sony Xperia S so
let's<00:00:14.099> take<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.150> official

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
let's take it out of the official

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.529 
let's take it out of the official
packaging<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.699> at<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.270> case

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
packaging and take a look at the case

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.010 
packaging and take a look at the case
itself<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.670> smooth<00:00:20.939> case<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.510> kind<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
itself so the smooth case is kind of a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.130 
itself so the smooth case is kind of a
newish<00:00:22.650> range<00:00:22.980> from<00:00:23.760> case-mate<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
newish range from case-mate it kind of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
newish range from case-mate it kind of
takes<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> barely-there<00:00:26.220> theme<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.570> kind

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
takes on the barely-there theme but kind

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
takes on the barely-there theme but kind
of<00:00:27.960> has<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> bit<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.099> silicone<00:00:29.760> esque

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
of has a bit more of a silicone esque

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
of has a bit more of a silicone esque
look<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.640> texture<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
look and texture to it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.450 
look and texture to it
so<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so you can see here that it is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
so you can see here that it is
completely<00:00:36.149> accustomed<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> experience<00:00:37.620> with

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
completely accustomed to experience with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.330 
completely accustomed to experience with
all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> cutouts<00:00:38.510> we've<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> case-mate

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
all the cutouts we've got the case-mate

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.190 
all the cutouts we've got the case-mate
branding<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> side<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> back

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
branding on the side and on the back

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.119 
branding on the side and on the back
here<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.940> rubbery<00:00:45.750> type<00:00:46.200> texture

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
here and it's got a rubbery type texture

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
here and it's got a rubbery type texture
and<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> smooth<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and it is smooth but it's got a little

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
and it is smooth but it's got a little
bit<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.160> grip<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.879> well

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
bit of grip there as well

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660 
bit of grip there as well
flex<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.190> best<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> can

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
flex is a little bit the best way I can

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
flex is a little bit the best way I can
describe<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> mix<00:00:55.410> between<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
describe this is really a mix between a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.310 
describe this is really a mix between a
standard<00:00:56.579> sort<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> gel<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.449> silicone<00:00:58.020> case

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
standard sort of gel or silicone case

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
standard sort of gel or silicone case
mixed<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.570> hardshell<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.350> haven't<00:01:01.620> got

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
mixed with a hardshell you haven't got

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
mixed with a hardshell you haven't got
quite<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> same<00:01:02.399> rigidity<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> hardshell

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
quite the same rigidity as a hardshell

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
quite the same rigidity as a hardshell
but<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.860> floppy<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.030> malleable

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but it's not as floppy or as malleable

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
but it's not as floppy or as malleable
as<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.820> silicone<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.060> gel<00:01:09.390> skin<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.100> take<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
as a silicone or gel skin so we take the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.789 
as a silicone or gel skin so we take the
device<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:13.490> we<00:01:14.490> pop<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.900> case<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
device and we pop it in the case like so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
device and we pop it in the case like so
so<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.100> takes<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so it takes just a little bit of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.020 
so it takes just a little bit of
wiggling<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
wiggling to get that in around the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.140 
wiggling to get that in around the
device<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.350> once<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> fits

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
device and once it in it is in it fits

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
device and once it in it is in it fits
quite<00:01:27.869> snugly<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.549> see

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
quite snugly so first of all we can see

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.840 
quite snugly so first of all we can see
there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.360> lip<00:01:30.900> around<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> edge<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.729> that's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there's a lip around the edge so that's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
there's a lip around the edge so that's
really<00:01:33.180> handy<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.750> placing<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
really handy if you're placing the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
really handy if you're placing the
device<00:01:34.439> face<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> surface<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.720> lifts

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
device face down on the surface it lifts

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
device face down on the surface it lifts
it<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.369> bigger<00:01:38.939> lip<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:39.689> we've

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it up and it's a bigger lip than we've

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
it up and it's a bigger lip than we've
seen<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> lot<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.799> cases<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
seen on a lot of other cases for the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
seen on a lot of other cases for the
experience<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> give<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
experience so it's going to give it that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.740 
experience so it's going to give it that
little<00:01:43.500> bit<00:01:43.979> more<00:01:44.189> protection<00:01:44.509> we've<00:01:45.509> got

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
little bit more protection we've got

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
little bit more protection we've got
good<00:01:46.200> coverage<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:47.009> around<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> corners

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
good coverage all around all the corners

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
good coverage all around all the corners
are<00:01:48.689> protected<00:01:50.210> very<00:01:51.210> nicely<00:01:52.009> things<00:01:53.009> like

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
are protected very nicely things like

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.710 
are protected very nicely things like
the<00:01:53.280> power<00:01:53.490> button<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.149> still<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.570> access

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the power button you still have access

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.039 
the power button you still have access
to<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.680> you've<00:01:55.799> sort<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
to them but you've sort of got this

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
to them but you've sort of got this
silicon<00:01:58.049> rubber<00:01:58.320> piece<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.610> press

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
silicon rubber piece to actually press

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.359 
silicon rubber piece to actually press
on<00:02:00.869> rather<00:02:01.350> than<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:01.920> touching<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
on rather than actually touching the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.760 
on rather than actually touching the
physical<00:02:02.909> button<00:02:03.240> itself<00:02:03.600> you've<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
physical button itself you've got a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.290 
physical button itself you've got a
cutout<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> camera<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.780> back

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
cutout here for the camera on the back
