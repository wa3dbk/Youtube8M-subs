people still actively playing that game

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.490 
people still actively playing that game
of<00:01:11.700> course<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.630> far<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:12.930> been<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.200> quite

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of course well so far has been out quite

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
of course well so far has been out quite
a<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.850> quite<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.270> longer

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a bit now that's quite a bit longer

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410 
a bit now that's quite a bit longer
especially<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:16.080> hard<00:01:16.259> line<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.580> matt

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
especially than hard line and this matt

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
especially than hard line and this matt
naturally<00:01:18.990> means<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.650> lot<00:01:20.009> less<00:01:20.250> people

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
naturally means that a lot less people

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.920 
naturally means that a lot less people
will<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.909> playing<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> compared<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> launch

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
will be playing it compared to launch

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.999 
will be playing it compared to launch
the<00:01:22.860> problem<00:01:23.189> lies<00:01:23.400> within<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> fact<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:25.009> in

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the problem lies within the fact that in

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.020 
the problem lies within the fact that in
hardline<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.780> less<00:01:27.990> people<00:01:28.409> Bob<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.729> hat

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
hardline a lot less people Bob like hat

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
hardline a lot less people Bob like hat
actually<00:01:30.600> bought<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> game<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:32.280> it's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually bought the game I think it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually bought the game I think it's
around<00:01:32.610> three<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.479> five<00:01:33.960> million<00:01:34.290> copies

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
around three or five million copies

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
around three or five million copies
something<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.729> battling<00:01:36.270> for

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
something like that and battling for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
something like that and battling for
heard<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.900> 20<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.439> 25<00:01:38.070> million<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
heard something like 20 or 25 million so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929 
heard something like 20 or 25 million so
again<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> numbers<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.939> there

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
again the numbers are going there

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
again the numbers are going there
they're<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.450> huge<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.259> huge<00:01:43.560> which

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they're just huge to get this huge which

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.210 
they're just huge to get this huge which
of<00:01:44.430> course<00:01:44.460> means<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:46.439> less<00:01:46.680> people

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
of course means that a lot less people

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
of course means that a lot less people
have<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.790> best<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> lot<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
have or best there will be a lot of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.499 
have or best there will be a lot of
potential<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.820> people<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.030> show

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
potential for people to actually show

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
potential for people to actually show
hardline<00:01:52.079> gameplay<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
hardline gameplay because actually so

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
hardline gameplay because actually so

like few people are still are actually

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160 
like few people are still are actually
playing<00:01:56.610> hard<00:01:56.909> line<00:01:57.030> compared<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> before<00:01:57.659> but

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
playing hard line compared to before but

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
playing hard line compared to before but
and<00:01:58.649> what<00:01:58.950> am<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> talking<00:01:59.250> actually<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and what am I talking actually the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
and what am I talking actually the
people<00:02:01.259> playing<00:02:01.560> hard<00:02:01.829> line<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> people

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
people playing hard line and the people

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
people playing hard line and the people
playing<00:02:03.689> those<00:02:03.869> before<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> same

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
playing those before are about the same

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.760 
playing those before are about the same
right<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:05.810> which<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.200> problem<00:02:07.619> if

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
right now which is kind of problem if

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
right now which is kind of problem if
you<00:02:07.920> again<00:02:08.250> consider<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.819> hard<00:02:09.090> line<00:02:09.270> has

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you again consider that hard line has

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
you again consider that hard line has
just<00:02:10.080> been<00:02:10.229> out<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> couple<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.830> weeks<00:02:11.340> months<00:02:12.000> I

just been out a couple of weeks months I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.300 
just been out a couple of weeks months I
actually<00:02:12.330> cannot<00:02:12.930> even

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
actually cannot even

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.339 
actually cannot even
meritorious<00:02:13.670> tied<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.270> belted<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:15.050> has<00:02:15.170> been

meritorious tied and belted for has been

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.850 
meritorious tied and belted for has been
out<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.620> over<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.860> year<00:02:16.360> again<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:18.200> actually

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
out for over a year again this actually

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.670 
out for over a year again this actually
would<00:02:19.430> mean<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:21.170> by<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.380> views

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
would mean and if I just go by the views

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.800 
would mean and if I just go by the views
that<00:02:22.220> people<00:02:22.610> right<00:02:23.000> now<00:02:23.180> are<00:02:23.209> still<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.569> lot

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that people right now are still a lot

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.210 
that people right now are still a lot
more<00:02:23.870> interested<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.530> battlefield<00:02:24.890> 4<00:02:24.920> of

more interested in battlefield 4 of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.760 
more interested in battlefield 4 of
course<00:02:25.459> reasons<00:02:26.390> for<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.870> battlefield

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
course reasons for that is battlefield

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.500 
course reasons for that is battlefield
hardline<00:02:28.190> has<00:02:28.370> not<00:02:28.580> been<00:02:28.790> sold<00:02:29.030> during<00:02:29.300> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
holiday season it has a really hard time

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.630 
holiday season it has a really hard time
being<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.720> game<00:02:32.959> or<00:02:33.380> after<00:02:34.099> battlefield<00:02:34.489> 4

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
being the game or after battlefield 4

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.699 
being the game or after battlefield 4
because<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.239> reputation<00:02:35.480> has<00:02:35.989> been<00:02:36.019> damaged

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
because the reputation has been damaged

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.460 
because the reputation has been damaged
too<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.400> oblivion<00:02:38.000> once<00:02:38.269> again<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.349> our

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
too into oblivion once again and our

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.070 
too into oblivion once again and our
factors<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.069> course<00:02:40.310> hardline<00:02:40.790> take<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:42.019> a

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
factors of course hardline take is a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.600 
factors of course hardline take is a
spin-off<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.620> takes<00:02:42.769> an<00:02:42.890> order<00:02:43.099> like<00:02:43.250> approach

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
spin-off it takes an order like approach

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.040 
spin-off it takes an order like approach
to<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.970> whole<00:02:44.000> Battlefield<00:02:44.510> franchise<00:02:44.630> it

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
to the whole Battlefield franchise it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.050 
to the whole Battlefield franchise it
just<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.400> constant<00:02:46.819> robbers

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
just got a like it's a constant robbers

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.880 
just got a like it's a constant robbers
game<00:02:47.239> with<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> touch<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.170> battlefield<00:02:48.799> you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
game with a touch of battlefield you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
game with a touch of battlefield you
don't<00:02:49.100> get<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> big<00:02:49.880> military<00:02:50.209> tank<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.200> jets

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
don't get the big military tank and jets

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.120 
don't get the big military tank and jets
and<00:02:51.799> like<00:02:52.610> military<00:02:53.420> warfare<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.799> cops

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
and like military warfare it's it's cops

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.949 
and like military warfare it's it's cops
and<00:02:55.280> robbers<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.360> something<00:02:56.810> different

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
and robbers so it is something different

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.710 
and robbers so it is something different
which<00:02:57.590> again<00:02:57.860> already<00:02:58.400> cuts<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> player

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
which again already cuts to the player

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.240 
which again already cuts to the player
base<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.110> half<00:03:00.290> together<00:03:00.709> with<00:03:00.890> all<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.130> other

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.229 
spin and with the community again I'm
just<00:04:12.980> rambling<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.370> again<00:04:13.579> about<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.850> fact

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
just rambling on again about the fact

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.900 
just rambling on again about the fact
that<00:04:14.329> many<00:04:15.319> problems<00:04:15.709> have<00:04:16.160> been<00:04:16.190> there<00:04:16.609> and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
that many problems have been there and

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.699 
that many problems have been there and
the<00:04:17.780> factors<00:04:18.229> have<00:04:18.470> not<00:04:18.709> been<00:04:18.919> very<00:04:19.269> well<00:04:20.709> very

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
the factors have not been very well very

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.630 
the factors have not been very well very
well<00:04:22.539> what's<00:04:23.539> worth<00:04:23.780> very<00:04:24.440> advantageous<00:04:24.919> for

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
well what's worth very advantageous for

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.830 
well what's worth very advantageous for
hard<00:04:25.880> line<00:04:26.060> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
hard line and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.170 
hard line and
guess<00:04:26.960> that's<00:04:27.199> why<00:04:27.350> it's<00:04:27.530> having<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> hard<00:04:28.010> time

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
guess that's why it's having a hard time

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.909 
guess that's why it's having a hard time
for<00:04:29.180> me<00:04:29.210> personally<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.720> still<00:04:30.169> do<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:30.530> to

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
for me personally I still do like to

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.500 
for me personally I still do like to
play<00:04:30.949> it<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.699> lot<00:04:31.940> more<00:04:32.060> fun<00:04:32.300> playing

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
play it I have a lot more fun playing

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.820 
play it I have a lot more fun playing
hard<00:04:32.840> line<00:04:33.020> than<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.320> have<00:04:33.590> been<00:04:33.770> in

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
hard line than I have been in

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.020 
hard line than I have been in
battlefield<00:04:34.250> 4<00:04:34.280> because<00:04:34.580> i<00:04:34.610> still<00:04:34.850> think

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
battlefield 4 because i still think

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.460 
battlefield 4 because i still think
that'll<00:04:35.330> feel<00:04:35.449> for<00:04:35.660> right<00:04:35.810> now<00:04:35.840> it's<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.260> in<00:04:36.410> a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
that'll feel for right now it's not in a

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.439 
that'll feel for right now it's not in a
stage<00:04:36.710> where<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:36.979> actually<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.460> top<00:04:38.240> notch

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
stage where it actually is top notch

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.600 
stage where it actually is top notch
playable<00:04:38.900> it's<00:04:39.199> it's<00:04:39.590> becoming<00:04:40.010> playable

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
playable it's it's becoming playable

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.510 
playable it's it's becoming playable
slowly<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.770> again<00:04:42.770> hardline<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> little

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
slowly and again hardline is a little

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.760 
slowly and again hardline is a little
bit<00:04:43.639> kind<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.970> retarded<00:04:44.449> ish<00:04:44.780> with<00:04:45.229> driving

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
bit kind of retarded ish with driving

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.520 
bit kind of retarded ish with driving
around<00:04:46.010> couches<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.790> stuff<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:47.900> can

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
around couches and stuff and but it can

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.189 
around couches and stuff and but it can
be<00:04:48.680> fun<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.400> gameplay<00:04:50.030> itself<00:04:50.690> is

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
be fun and the gameplay itself is

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.469 
be fun and the gameplay itself is
actually<00:04:51.350> not<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.770> big<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.610> deal<00:04:52.729> like<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
actually not that big of a deal like the

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.840 
actually not that big of a deal like the
problems<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.290> has<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:55.160> not<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.490> big

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
problems that it has it's not that big

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.409 
problems that it has it's not that big
of<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.090> deal<00:04:56.210> at<00:04:56.449> least<00:04:56.630> for<00:04:56.780> me<00:04:56.949> but<00:04:57.949> once<00:04:58.160> again

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
of a deal at least for me but once again

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.110 
of a deal at least for me but once again
i<00:04:59.419> do<00:04:59.870> think<00:05:00.350> long<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.250> less<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.669> hard<00:05:01.910> line

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
i do think long the less that hard line

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.240 
i do think long the less that hard line
might<00:05:02.510> pull<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.870> Titan<00:05:03.350> fall<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.650> us<00:05:03.770> which

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
might pull a Titan fall on us which

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.790 
might pull a Titan fall on us which
again<00:05:04.490> means<00:05:04.810> titanfall<00:05:05.810> same<00:05:06.229> thing<00:05:06.470> beta

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
again means titanfall same thing beta

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.590 
again means titanfall same thing beta

everyone had the fun for like the first
week<00:05:13.340> second<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.270> slowly<00:05:14.540> kind<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:15.110> died

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
week second and it slowly kind of died

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.930 
week second and it slowly kind of died
off<00:05:15.350> like<00:05:15.770> actually<00:05:16.160> not<00:05:16.310> slowly<00:05:16.550> but<00:05:16.760> very

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
off like actually not slowly but very

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.480 
off like actually not slowly but very
quickly<00:05:17.389> that<00:05:17.810> off<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.169> I<00:05:18.950> have<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.130> feeling

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
quickly that off and I have a feeling

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.400 
quickly that off and I have a feeling
that<00:05:19.520> hard<00:05:19.880> line<00:05:20.060> will<00:05:20.360> have<00:05:20.539> or<00:05:20.840> share<00:05:21.200> the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
that hard line will have or share the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.330 
that hard line will have or share the
same<00:05:21.590> fate<00:05:21.889> as<00:05:22.210> Titan<00:05:23.210> folded<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:24.770> yeah<00:05:25.039> right

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
same fate as Titan folded so yeah right

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.180 
same fate as Titan folded so yeah right
now<00:05:25.880> this<00:05:26.720> is<00:05:26.810> my<00:05:26.930> take<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.199> it<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.530> do<00:05:27.949> not<00:05:28.130> think

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
now this is my take on it I do not think

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.830 
now this is my take on it I do not think
hard<00:05:28.490> line<00:05:28.639> is<00:05:28.729> dead<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:28.940> just<00:05:29.240> think<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.690> has<00:05:29.810> a

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
hard line is dead I just think it has a

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.290 
hard line is dead I just think it has a
smaller<00:05:30.229> player<00:05:30.530> base<00:05:30.970> partly<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.210> reason

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
smaller player base partly the reason

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.779 
smaller player base partly the reason
being<00:05:32.690> again<00:05:33.530> it's<00:05:33.680> not<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.070> normal

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
being again it's not the normal

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.340 
being again it's not the normal
battlefield<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:35.450> that'll<00:05:35.840> feel<00:05:35.960> for<00:05:36.169> was

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
battlefield and that'll feel for was

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.469 
battlefield and that'll feel for was
kind<00:05:36.560> of<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.830> hard<00:05:37.130> fit<00:05:37.400> like<00:05:37.789> being<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.360> game

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
kind of a hard fit like being the game

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.810 
kind of a hard fit like being the game
after<00:05:38.660> battle<00:05:38.930> force<00:05:39.200> just<00:05:39.350> hard<00:05:39.590> but<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:40.550> again

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
after battle force just hard but I again

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.550 
after battle force just hard but I again
I<00:05:40.850> would<00:05:41.150> love<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.389> you<00:05:41.750> guys<00:05:41.900> opinion<00:05:42.320> in<00:05:42.440> the
