an exercise jump the next size they just

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.970 
an exercise jump the next size they just
gradually<00:03:26.160> get<00:03:26.780> ever<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.080> slightly<00:03:28.470> larger

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980

the<00:03:45.280> game<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:46.170> mean<00:03:47.170> don't<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.500> me<00:03:47.560> wrong<00:03:47.710> it's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
the game I mean don't get me wrong it's

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.550 
the game I mean don't get me wrong it's
okay<00:03:48.490> but<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:48.970> certainly<00:03:49.540> no<00:03:49.870> Mario<00:03:50.260> Kart

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.050 
killer it's kind of boring you don't
have<00:03:53.470> any<00:03:53.650> objects<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.490> throw<00:03:54.850> or

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
basically you haven't it you can attack

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.050 
basically you haven't it you can attack
and<00:03:59.799> then<00:03:59.890> your<00:04:00.099> character<00:04:00.580> on<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.849> right

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.259 
side of the fighting can attack so a
attacks<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.560> left<00:04:05.920> which<00:04:06.459> makes<00:04:06.939> sense

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
attacks to the left which makes sense

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.390 
attacks to the left which makes sense
and<00:04:07.540> see<00:04:08.170> attached<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.099> which

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
and see attached to the right which

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.460 
and see attached to the right which
makes<00:04:09.640> sense

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
makes sense

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.200 
makes sense
kind<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.250> neat<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.490> way<00:04:11.520> they<00:04:11.700> didn't<00:04:11.910> control

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
kind of neat the way they didn't control

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.850 
kind of neat the way they didn't control
is<00:04:12.360> with<00:04:12.510> your<00:04:12.660> attacking<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.350> left<00:04:13.650> or

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
is with your attacking to the left or

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.819 
is with your attacking to the left or
right<00:04:14.870> kinda<00:04:15.870> reminds<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.320> road<00:04:16.590> rash

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
right kinda reminds you of road rash

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.160 
right kinda reminds you of road rash
basically<00:04:17.549> all<00:04:17.880> they<00:04:18.510> can<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.930> like

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
basically all they can do this like

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.500 
basically all they can do this like
punch<00:04:19.739> or<00:04:20.070> kick<00:04:20.100> or<00:04:20.489> whatever

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
punch or kick or whatever

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.240 
punch or kick or whatever
but<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.290> know<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.500> certainly<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> lot<00:04:24.100> of

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
but you know it certainly be a lot of

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.350 
but you know it certainly be a lot of
fun<00:04:24.460> or<00:04:24.610> with<00:04:24.760> no<00:04:26.760> object<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.000> can<00:04:28.120> throw

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
fun or with no object so you can throw

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.330 
fun or with no object so you can throw
like<00:04:28.630> my<00:04:28.840> parents<00:04:29.410> left

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
like my parents left

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.010 
like my parents left
guess<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.030> didn't<00:04:32.240> want<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.449> completely<00:04:35.020> this

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
guess I didn't want to completely this

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.690 
guess I didn't want to completely this
shadow

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.690 

now<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.300> get<00:04:39.480> nitrous<00:04:40.050> basically<00:04:40.800> equivalent

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
now you get nitrous basically equivalent

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.680 
now you get nitrous basically equivalent
to<00:04:42.030> nitrous<00:04:42.480> whatever<00:04:42.900> some<00:04:43.470> sort<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.830> boost

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
to nitrous whatever some sort of a boost

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.120 
to nitrous whatever some sort of a boost
with<00:04:45.690> these<00:04:45.840> ends<00:04:46.260> every<00:04:46.470> time<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.800> finish<00:04:47.040> a

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
with these ends every time you finish a

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.470 
with these ends every time you finish a
lab<00:04:47.510> can't<00:04:48.510> figure<00:04:48.720> out<00:04:48.810> how<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.020> use<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.230> so

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
lab can't figure out how to use that so

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.260 
lab can't figure out how to use that so
yeah<00:04:52.340> let's<00:04:53.340> test<00:04:53.490> all<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.730> buttons<00:04:54.120> it

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
yeah let's test all the buttons it

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.460 
yeah let's test all the buttons it
doesn't<00:04:54.510> seem<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.780> work<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:01.140> then<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.380> go

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
doesn't seem to work and then you go

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:31.800 
doesn't seem to work and then you go
there's<00:05:01.740> level<00:05:02.040> one<00:05:02.190> done

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
I don't get this bike out I'm guessing

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.800 
I don't get this bike out I'm guessing
that's<00:07:23.979> like<00:07:24.430> every<00:07:24.669> time<00:07:24.880> you<00:07:25.000> get<00:07:25.120> hit

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:53.100

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.629 

if<00:07:54.110> only<00:07:54.320> more<00:07:54.590> games<00:07:54.860> took<00:07:55.070> advantage<00:07:55.340> of

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050 
like a first person shooter I think

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.689
