00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
really well to dive for the line I'm not

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.250 
really well to dive for the line I'm not
sure<00:06:36.210> he<00:06:36.420> been<00:06:36.570> able<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.810> clear<00:06:37.050> another

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
sure he been able to clear another

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.390 
sure he been able to clear another
hurdle<00:06:37.530> but<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.460> line<00:06:38.640> came<00:06:38.940> in<00:06:39.120> time<00:06:40.400> again

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
hurdle but the line came in time again

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.330 
hurdle but the line came in time again
look<00:06:41.940> at<00:06:42.090> from<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:43.050> head<00:06:43.320> on<00:06:43.500> camera<00:06:43.980> here

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
look at from the head on camera here

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.590 
look at from the head on camera here
Duke<00:06:44.730> arrived<00:06:46.490> well<00:06:47.490> he<00:06:47.580> runs<00:06:47.760> well<00:06:48.000> I<00:06:48.060> think

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
Duke arrived well he runs well I think

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.810 
Duke arrived well he runs well I think
almost<00:06:49.110> all<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.710> race<00:06:49.890> over<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.340> last<00:06:50.550> two

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
almost all the race over the last two

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.220 
almost all the race over the last two
hurdles<00:06:51.030> though<00:06:51.420> he<00:06:51.570> starts<00:06:52.020> leaning

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
hurdles though he starts leaning

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.750 
hurdles though he starts leaning
backwards<00:06:52.920> a<00:06:52.950> little<00:06:53.010> bit<00:06:53.280> as<00:06:53.400> the<00:06:53.520> pressure

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
backwards a little bit as the pressure

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.520 
backwards a little bit as the pressure
starts<00:06:54.210> coming<00:06:54.510> and<00:06:54.660> I<00:06:54.720> think<00:06:54.780> that<00:06:55.110> just

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
starts coming and I think that just

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.880 
starts coming and I think that just
pulls<00:06:56.520> his<00:06:56.760> hips<00:06:57.030> back<00:06:57.330> a<00:06:57.360> little<00:06:57.630> bit<00:06:57.890> and

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
pulls his hips back a little bit and

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.530 
pulls his hips back a little bit and
that's<00:06:59.130> why<00:06:59.400> he<00:06:59.550> hits<00:06:59.820> that<00:06:59.940> last<00:07:00.240> hurdle

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
that's why he hits that last hurdle

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.110 
that's why he hits that last hurdle
those<00:07:01.400> Johnston<00:07:02.400> though<00:07:02.490> on<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.730> inside<00:07:03.090> of

those Johnston though on the inside of

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.700 
those Johnston though on the inside of
him<00:07:03.390> is<00:07:03.450> hitting<00:07:03.720> many<00:07:03.930> hurdles<00:07:04.170> please<00:07:04.440> used

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
him is hitting many hurdles please used

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.010 
him is hitting many hurdles please used
to<00:07:04.860> that<00:07:05.780> so<00:07:06.780> Duke<00:07:07.020> right<00:07:07.230> now<00:07:07.880> coming<00:07:08.880> up<00:07:09.120> to

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
to that so Duke right now coming up to

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.870 
to that so Duke right now coming up to
the<00:07:10.140> last<00:07:10.290> seven<00:07:10.680> I<00:07:10.740> just<00:07:10.980> watch<00:07:11.160> he's<00:07:11.550> going

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
the last seven I just watch he's going

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.750 
the last seven I just watch he's going
slightly<00:07:12.630> backwards<00:07:13.020> catches<00:07:13.470> it<00:07:13.620> dips<00:07:14.490> with

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 
slightly backwards catches it dips with

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.520 
slightly backwards catches it dips with
the<00:07:14.850> hips<00:07:15.090> but<00:07:15.390> still<00:07:15.840> because<00:07:16.080> of<00:07:16.230> sheer

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
the hips but still because of sheer

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.180 
the hips but still because of sheer
strength
