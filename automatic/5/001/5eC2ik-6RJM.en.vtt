consideration because your iPhone 5 it's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.470 
consideration because your iPhone 5 it's
a<00:03:21.130> different<00:03:21.459> form<00:03:21.670> factor<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.209> would

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
a different form factor but I would

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.690 
a different form factor but I would
assume<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:23.980> would<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> form

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
assume that this would be the form

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.550 
assume that this would be the form
factor<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.209> app<00:03:25.359> will<00:03:25.660> likely<00:03:25.870> use<00:03:26.109> going

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
factor that app will likely use going

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.349 
factor that app will likely use going
forward<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.099> would<00:03:27.160> expect<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.609> see<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.880> on<00:03:27.940> ipad

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
forward I would expect to see it on ipad
