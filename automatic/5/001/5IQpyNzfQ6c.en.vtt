00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.310
 makes in the bichi of the bmx on the motorbike 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 to be suspended in the air for the time 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.440
 more epic that can inscribe the truth 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 is that being sincere if it is difficult 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.130
 these stunts but as we already have 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.960
 seen for many weeks we put on 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.180
 here at number five and this is where 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.350

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.880

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.540
 true to be later in positions 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.580
 or be in this exhibition of savages 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 since they have already been very repetitive and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.899
 they have some difficulty so in the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.899

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.900
 way that will fall again seeing the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.550

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.660
 look at it because if it's going to fall 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.230

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.560

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.769
 of the bridge throughout the middle area 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.500
 this case is going to be the gray of power 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.269
 fly a bit the period the bike towards 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.799
 back and you will see how it falls in this 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.019
 building in the middle part doing 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.400
 the trick of standing up this great 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.319
 trick that lately is going a lot 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.730

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.419
 very very good clip and we are going with the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.419
 winner this week 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.680
 and for the king this week we have a 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.109
 tree 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.540
 people again so how can you see 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.280
 comes with this bike here makes a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.139
 suspense in the air if you suspend 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.930
 suspends and will not let me get up there 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.819
 Do not tell me or my god walking 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.530
 it got up there we're going to see it on camera 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.810
 slow as it is suspended all the time 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.060
 here in the air and at that moment when 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.310
 least think about it saves clip and it grabs 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.469
 right here you will see that I was very 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.450
 difficult to fall exactly in what is the 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:48.389
 antenna so it may be difficult 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.620
