what's up planetary nutrition Brad and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.320 
what's up planetary nutrition Brad and
Jeff<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.420> we're<00:00:12.930> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.289> a<00:00:13.320> planetary

showdown okay show them to get it done
to<00:00:17.759> blaze<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.810> who<00:00:19.680> stands

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
to blaze and we're gonna see who stands

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.300 
to blaze and we're gonna see who stands
the<00:00:20.250> test<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.610> time<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.660> whey<00:00:22.650> protein

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the test of time here which whey protein

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
the test of time here which whey protein
is<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> taste<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.349> best

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
is going to taste the best

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.790

this is strictly a taste test showdown

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.419 
this is strictly a taste test showdown
okay

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
okay

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.630 
okay
all<00:00:29.730> three<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.980> we're<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.099> four<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> these

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
all three are we're all four of these

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720 
all three are we're all four of these
are<00:00:32.940> whey<00:00:33.750> proteins<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> check

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
are whey proteins we put the check

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.700 
are whey proteins we put the check
protein<00:00:36.269> in<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> our

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
protein in because that's one of our

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
protein in because that's one of our
favorites<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.790> has<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.059> coffee<00:00:39.449> flavor<00:00:39.860> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we're not going to be taste testing that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.149 
we're not going to be taste testing that
today<00:00:43.260> we've<00:00:43.470> done<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.799> in<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.949> previous

we're gonna do a blind taste test we
have<00:01:02.939> all<00:01:03.479> three<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:04.890> proteins<00:01:05.990> branded

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
have all three of these proteins branded

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
have all three of these proteins branded
a<00:01:07.049> blog<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.560> day<00:01:07.680> about<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> choose

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420 
a blog the other day about how to choose
a<00:01:08.549> protein<00:01:09.060> online<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.979> we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> help

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
a protein online so we're going to help

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.249 
a protein online so we're going to help
you<00:01:11.520> today<00:01:11.700> by<00:01:12.090> producing<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> video<00:01:12.929> as

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
well so what we have is Pro design we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.459 
well so what we have is Pro design we
have<00:01:18.270> ISO<00:01:19.079> flex<00:01:19.969> and<00:01:20.969> we<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.270> CS<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> Wayne<00:01:22.109> so

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
have ISO flex and we have CS in Wayne so

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.469 
have ISO flex and we have CS in Wayne so
what<00:01:22.649> we've<00:01:22.799> done<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.039> we've<00:01:23.429> created<00:01:24.119> a

three of these we're going to take these

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.209 
three of these we're going to take these
out<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.079> way<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.950> cups

out of the way so you can see our cups

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.389 
out of the way so you can see our cups
here<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.560> we've<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.280> is

here but what we've got here is

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.959 
here but what we've got here is
basically<00:01:33.170> three<00:01:34.170> cups<00:01:34.469> chocolate<00:01:35.009> peanut

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
basically three cups chocolate peanut

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.429 
basically three cups chocolate peanut
butter<00:01:36.020> whey<00:01:37.020> protein<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
butter whey protein so that we can do a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.859 
butter whey protein so that we can do a
blind<00:01:40.740> taste<00:01:40.890> test<00:01:41.399> for<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.630> there

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
blind taste test for you all out there

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
blind taste test for you all out there
in<00:01:42.960> YouTube<00:01:43.289> land<00:01:43.350> give<00:01:44.249> you<00:01:44.340> some

and a looks very well mix and no

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.380 
and a looks very well mix and no
floaties<00:03:03.520> residue<00:03:04.520> definitely<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> thin

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
floaties residue definitely a thin

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.050 
floaties residue definitely a thin
texture<00:03:06.490> good<00:03:07.490> taste

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
texture good taste

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.960 
texture good taste
that's<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.660> all<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.320> be<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:13.370> little

but just a slide a little bit more

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.330 
but just a slide a little bit more
frothy<00:03:34.790> than<00:03:35.030> an<00:03:35.660> hour<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.140> product<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.070> what

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
frothy than an hour a product is what

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.190 
frothy than an hour a product is what

fill<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:50.930> one<00:03:51.080> too<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.410> might<00:03:56.500> definitely<00:03:57.500> a

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
fill this one too I might definitely a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.990 
fill this one too I might definitely a
little<00:03:57.980> dark<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.430> was<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.580> completely

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
little dark that was a completely

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.050 
little dark that was a completely
different<00:03:59.390> taste<00:03:59.930> than<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.130> middle<00:04:01.580> one<00:04:01.730> and

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
different taste than the middle one and

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.590 
different taste than the middle one and
