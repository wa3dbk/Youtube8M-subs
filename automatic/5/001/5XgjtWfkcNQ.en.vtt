00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
they don't actually check it so once you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.790 
they don't actually check it so once you
have<00:03:39.360> unrooted<00:03:40.020> your<00:03:40.170> phone<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:42.800> unroot

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
of your phone and put put stock rom on

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000 
of your phone and put put stock rom on
there<00:03:46.050> oh<00:03:46.200> there<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:46.830> go

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
there oh there we go

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.210 
there oh there we go
so<00:03:47.460> hits<00:03:47.760> volume<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.840> reset<00:03:49.170> counter<00:03:49.560> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
so hits volume up to reset counter so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.700 
so hits volume up to reset counter so
I'm<00:03:50.280> gonna<00:03:50.430> hit<00:03:50.550> volume<00:03:50.880> up<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.650> is

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
I'm gonna hit volume up and this is

I'm gonna hit volume up and this is
resetting<00:03:53.220> counter<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.850> status<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:55.130> that's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
resetting counter and status and that's

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.340 
resetting counter and status and that's
all<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.430> doing<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:57.300> we<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.020> double<00:03:58.320> check

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
all it's doing and we can double check

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.640 
all it's doing and we can double check
this<00:03:58.740> after<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.250> boots<00:04:00.230> anyway<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.620> uh

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
this after it boots anyway this is uh

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.160 
this after it boots anyway this is uh
you<00:04:02.310> know<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.610> don't<00:04:02.790> really<00:04:02.910> want<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.930> show<00:04:04.110> you
