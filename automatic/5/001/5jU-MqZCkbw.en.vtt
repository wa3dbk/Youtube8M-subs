00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.479 
we just should have maybe slow the game
down<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.890> that's<00:00:46.890> where<00:00:47.340> we'll<00:00:47.460> be

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
down but you know that's where we'll be

decisions come your way adult me away

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.930 
decisions come your way adult me away
and<00:01:01.559> we're<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> crib<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and we're not going to crib about that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
and we're not going to crib about that
we<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.589> probably<00:01:04.799> did<00:01:05.040> enough<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> win<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
we we probably did enough to win the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
we we probably did enough to win the
game<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.119> experienced<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> monster

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
game but they experienced a monster

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.820 
game but they experienced a monster
shown<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> last<00:01:07.820> 10<00:01:08.820> minutes<00:01:09.830> big

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
shown in the last 10 minutes big

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
shown in the last 10 minutes big
difference<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.340> perhaps<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> fact<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
difference is perhaps the fact that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240 
difference is perhaps the fact that
they've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> pedigree<00:01:12.869> northam<00:01:13.710> yep

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.720 
obviously giving you a lot of pride the
way<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.500> showed<00:03:24.740> up<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.220> yeah<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.520> mean

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
way that you showed up and yeah I mean

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.890 
way that you showed up and yeah I mean
if<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.030> took<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.480> on<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.720> few

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
if you took it to that on the few

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.480 
if you took it to that on the few
occasions<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.470> scrum<00:03:27.770> as<00:03:27.890> well<00:03:28.070> well<00:03:28.460> I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
occasions in the scrum as well well I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.920 
occasions in the scrum as well well I
think<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:29.240> we're<00:03:29.360> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.540> remember<00:03:29.690> is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
think what we're going to remember is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.840 
think what we're going to remember is
where<00:03:30.110> we<00:03:30.230> are<00:03:30.350> as<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.500> team<00:03:30.590> we<00:03:30.980> got<00:03:31.700> other

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
where we are as a team we got other

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.160 
where we are as a team we got other
budget<00:03:32.210> like<00:03:32.360> some<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.660> other<00:03:32.810> clubs<00:03:33.020> so

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
budget like some of the other clubs so

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.580 
budget like some of the other clubs so
our<00:03:33.290> first<00:03:33.500> line<00:03:34.300> 15<00:03:35.300> he's<00:03:35.840> pretty<00:03:36.110> strong<00:03:36.410> and

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
our first line 15 he's pretty strong and

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.170 
our first line 15 he's pretty strong and
can<00:03:36.710> compete<00:03:36.950> with<00:03:37.010> everybody<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:37.610> when<00:03:38.120> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
can compete with everybody but when you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.210 
can compete with everybody but when you
have<00:03:38.210> to<00:03:38.360> start<00:03:38.540> making<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.830> we<00:03:40.070> have

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
have to start making you you we have

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.620 
have to start making you you we have
half<00:03:40.460> a<00:03:40.550> dozen<00:03:40.670> engine<00:03:41.030> when<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.270> start<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
half a dozen engine when you start to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.020 
half a dozen engine when you start to
make<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.900> reserve<00:03:42.590> coming<00:03:42.920> on<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.520> isn't<00:03:43.880> as

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
make you reserve coming on it isn't as

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.060 
make you reserve coming on it isn't as
strong<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:44.990> told<00:03:45.290> again<00:03:45.590> today

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
strong and I think that told again today

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.160 
strong and I think that told again today
that<00:03:46.820> no<00:03:47.030> discredit<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.840> people<00:03:48.110> of

that no discredit to the people of

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.630 
that no discredit to the people of
command<00:03:48.470> but<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:48.800> think<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.490> know<00:03:49.610> I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
command but I just think you know I
