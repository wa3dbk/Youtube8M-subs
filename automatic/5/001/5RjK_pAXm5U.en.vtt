00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.259 
use foam or balsa wood the ball so what
I'm<00:02:36.170> using<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.650> really<00:02:37.130> really<00:02:37.549> really<00:02:38.000> thin

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
I'm using is really really really thin

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.080 
I'm using is really really really thin
so<00:02:38.810> here<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> gotta<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:40.190> foam<00:02:40.489> also<00:02:40.790> make

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
so here you gotta use foam also make

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.039 
so here you gotta use foam also make
that<00:02:41.269> then<00:02:41.799> again<00:02:42.799> I'm<00:02:43.670> gonna<00:02:43.970> say<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.690> has<00:02:44.840> to

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
that then again I'm gonna say it has to

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.539 
that then again I'm gonna say it has to
be<00:02:45.170> under<00:02:45.739> 15<00:02:46.700> grams<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.769> most<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.280> could<00:02:49.370> be

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
be under 15 grams the most it could be

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.199 
be under 15 grams the most it could be
is<00:02:49.730> about<00:02:50.000> 52<00:02:50.690> grams<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:52.489> going<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.819> need<00:02:53.000> a

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
is about 52 grams you're going to need a

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.370 
is about 52 grams you're going to need a
pencil<00:02:55.090> Carre's<00:02:56.090> your<00:02:56.239> blade<00:02:56.450> basic<00:02:56.989> scotch

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
pencil Carre's your blade basic scotch

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.870 
pencil Carre's your blade basic scotch
tape<00:02:57.709> or<00:02:58.010> painters<00:02:58.700> can<00:02:58.970> finally<00:02:59.890> hot<00:03:00.890> glue<00:03:01.250> so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
tape or painters can finally hot glue so

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.910 
tape or painters can finally hot glue so
the<00:03:02.269> first<00:03:02.540> thing<00:03:02.810> you're<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.349> do<00:03:03.590> is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
the first thing you're going to do is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.940 
the first thing you're going to do is
you're<00:03:04.519> gonna<00:03:04.610> make<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:05.120> pod<00:03:05.390> by<00:03:06.380> gluing<00:03:06.829> a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
you're gonna make your pod by gluing a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.729 
you're gonna make your pod by gluing a
propeller<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.390> top<00:03:08.599> of<00:03:08.630> your<00:03:08.810> fuselage

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
propeller on to the top of your fuselage

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.199 
propeller on to the top of your fuselage
I<00:03:10.160> also<00:03:10.610> glued<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.690> servo<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.319> receiver

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
I also glued the servo and receiver

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.800 
I also glued the servo and receiver
board<00:03:14.209> near<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.440> canal<00:03:15.829> connected

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
board near it so it's canal connected

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.780 
board near it so it's canal connected
now<00:03:17.810> all<00:03:18.019> we<00:03:18.170> have<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.350> do<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.769> get<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> battery

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
now all we have to do is get the battery

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.360 
now all we have to do is get the battery
in<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.319> connect<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:21.980> servo

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
in there and connect the servo

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:32.640 
in there and connect the servo
connectors<00:03:23.239> inside<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.109> servos<00:03:25.269> goes<00:03:26.500> inside

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.059 

the<00:03:33.650> batteries<00:03:34.040> will<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:39.010> why<00:03:40.010> is

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
the batteries will and why is

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.030 
the batteries will and why is
everything<00:03:40.519> good

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.340 

yeah<00:03:47.040> cut<00:03:47.250> off<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> excess<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.810> wire<00:03:48.990> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
yeah cut off the excess of the wire the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.980 
yeah cut off the excess of the wire the
servos<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.160> position<00:03:50.670> by<00:03:50.850> using<00:03:50.880> hot<00:03:51.360> glue<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
servos in position by using hot glue and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.490 
servos in position by using hot glue and
then<00:03:52.650> apply<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.190> walls<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.910> fuselage

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
then apply the walls of the fuselage

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.940 
then apply the walls of the fuselage
this<00:03:55.500> should<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> result<00:03:57.440> get<00:03:58.440> your<00:03:58.680> two

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
this should be the result get your two

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.330 
this should be the result get your two
pieces<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.790> elevator<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.570> rudder<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
pieces the elevator and the rudder and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.820 
pieces the elevator and the rudder and
tape<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.550> tape<00:04:03.510> them<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.080> they<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.620> easily

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
tape and tape them so they can easily

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.800 
tape and tape them so they can easily
flex<00:04:05.370> around<00:04:05.520> when<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.090> wired<00:04:06.300> pushback

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
flex around when the wired pushback

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.260 
flex around when the wired pushback
result<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.190> kind<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.670> flex<00:04:08.970> really

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
result now it can kind of flex really

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.920 
result now it can kind of flex really
easily<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.950> see<00:04:12.800> like<00:04:13.800> that<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
easily as you can see like that the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.470 
easily as you can see like that the
servos<00:04:16.290> will<00:04:16.500> be<00:04:16.650> able<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.980> move<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.480> together

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
servos will be able to move it together

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.039 
servos will be able to move it together
as<00:04:18.720> pictured<00:04:19.730> now<00:04:20.730> you're<00:04:21.480> gonna<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.930> to

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
as pictured now you're gonna want to

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.890 
as pictured now you're gonna want to
glue<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:22.380> on<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.860> back<00:04:23.040> of<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.370> fuselage

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
glue it on to the back of the fuselage

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.020 
glue it on to the back of the fuselage
now<00:04:24.900> glue<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.260> servos<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.250> elevator<00:04:26.610> servo

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
now glue the servos the elevator servo

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.360 
now glue the servos the elevator servo
and<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> rudder<00:04:27.570> servo<00:04:27.890> then<00:04:28.890> glue<00:04:29.250> them<00:04:29.340> down

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
and the rudder servo then glue them down

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.409 
and the rudder servo then glue them down
so<00:04:29.790> they<00:04:29.940> could<00:04:30.260> easily<00:04:31.260> move<00:04:31.940> on<00:04:32.940> top<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
so they could easily move on top of the

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.220 
so they could easily move on top of the
long<00:04:33.630> wing<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.080> glue<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
long wing and glue it on this is the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.010 
long wing and glue it on this is the
last<00:04:37.470> time<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.800> adjust<00:04:38.250> your<00:04:38.430> servos<00:04:39.020> because

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
last time to adjust your servos because

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.180 
last time to adjust your servos because
we're<00:04:40.169> gonna<00:04:40.260> be<00:04:40.470> gluing<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> bottom

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
we're gonna be gluing the bottom

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.610 
we're gonna be gluing the bottom
fuselage<00:04:41.730> on<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.750> make<00:04:42.960> them<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.260> straight<00:04:43.500> as

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
fuselage on so make them as straight as

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.060 
fuselage on so make them as straight as
you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.480> wings<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:46.110> mean<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
you can so the wings I mean the the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.670 
you can so the wings I mean the the
rudder<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.850> stuff<00:04:48.120> move<00:04:48.960> very<00:04:49.200> good

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
rudder and stuff move very good

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.710 
rudder and stuff move very good
once<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.310> who've<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.640> bottom<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.540> could

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
once you who've the bottom on you could

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.180 
once you who've the bottom on you could
glue<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> wings<00:04:52.169> together<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.650> place<00:04:52.950> them

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
glue the wings together and place them

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.430 
glue the wings together and place them
both<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.610> you're<00:04:54.210> gonna<00:04:54.300> want<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> wings<00:04:55.020> out

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
both on you're gonna want the wings out

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.320 
both on you're gonna want the wings out
of<00:04:55.710> dihedral<00:04:56.070> shapes<00:04:56.550> facing<00:04:57.950> both<00:04:59.060> angles<00:05:00.060> so

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
of dihedral shapes facing both angles so

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.870 
of dihedral shapes facing both angles so
the<00:05:00.419> angles<00:05:00.780> should<00:05:00.840> be<00:05:01.140> just<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.650> same<00:05:01.880> after

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
the angles should be just the same after

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.909 
the angles should be just the same after
that<00:05:02.910> either<00:05:03.390> tape<00:05:03.870> or<00:05:04.169> velcro<00:05:04.530> down<00:05:04.740> the

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
that either tape or velcro down the

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.990
