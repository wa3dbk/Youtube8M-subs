00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
end up looking like a pterodactyl and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.040 
end up looking like a pterodactyl and
the<00:00:31.400> elbows<00:00:31.699> gonna<00:00:31.880> be<00:00:31.999> in<00:00:32.180> too<00:00:32.480> far<00:00:32.689> it's<00:00:32.870> hard

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the elbows gonna be in too far it's hard

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.690 
the elbows gonna be in too far it's hard
for<00:00:33.140> me<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:33.350> even<00:00:33.740> mimic<00:00:34.070> just<00:00:34.370> because<00:00:34.550> my

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
for me to even mimic just because my

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.779 
for me to even mimic just because my
shoulder<00:00:35.059> range<00:00:35.239> of<00:00:35.360> motion<00:00:35.629> is<00:00:35.750> very<00:00:35.930> poor

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
shoulder range of motion is very poor

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.209 
shoulder range of motion is very poor
but<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:38.090> lot<00:00:38.989> of<00:00:39.140> athletes<00:00:39.530> because<00:00:39.800> they<00:00:39.950> hear

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
but a lot of athletes because they hear

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.860 
but a lot of athletes because they hear
a<00:00:40.250> coach<00:00:40.550> say<00:00:40.789> you<00:00:40.850> got<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.120> tuck<00:00:41.329> your<00:00:41.539> elbows

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
a coach say you got to tuck your elbows

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.799 
a coach say you got to tuck your elbows
in<00:00:42.079> they<00:00:42.559> do<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.890> too<00:00:43.129> severe<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:43.940> at<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
in they do it too severe and at the

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.240 
in they do it too severe and at the
bottom<00:00:45.020> they're<00:00:45.379> kind<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:45.680> pinned<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.100> this

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
bottom they're kind of pinned in this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.920 
bottom they're kind of pinned in this
funky<00:00:46.670> position<00:00:47.120> that's<00:00:47.270> not<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.539> strong

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
funky position that's not a strong

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.779 
funky position that's not a strong
position<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:48.859> this<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.250> wrong<00:00:49.489> way<00:00:49.730> to

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
position so this is the wrong way to

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.119 
position so this is the wrong way to
bench<00:00:50.030> press<00:00:50.120> elbows<00:00:50.660> are<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:50.899> too<00:00:51.199> tight<00:00:51.440> to

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
bench press elbows are in too tight to

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.889 
bench press elbows are in too tight to
his<00:00:52.280> body<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:52.850> he's<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:53.329> kind<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.570> an<00:00:53.660> awkward

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
his body and he's in kind of an awkward

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.450 
his body and he's in kind of an awkward
pressing<00:00:54.620> position<00:00:54.980> there<00:00:55.100> do<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.280> few<00:00:55.519> more

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
pressing position there do a few more

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.310 
pressing position there do a few more
and<00:00:58.460> with<00:00:59.420> some<00:00:59.660> people<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.019> are<00:01:00.170> real

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and with some people that are real

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.950 
and with some people that are real
mobile<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.890> gets<00:01:01.070> even<00:01:01.340> worse<00:01:01.370> than<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:01.960> so

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
mobile it gets even worse than that so

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.750 
mobile it gets even worse than that so
we<00:01:03.050> want<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.289> try<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.500> avoid<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.519> want<00:01:04.699> to

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
we want to try to avoid that you want to

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.460 
we want to try to avoid that you want to
