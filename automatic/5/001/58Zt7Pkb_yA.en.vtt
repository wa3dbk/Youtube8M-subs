00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
transit but town at least that'd be

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.300 
transit but town at least that'd be
pretty<00:03:30.560> fun<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:30.890> think<00:03:31.040> um<00:03:31.870> yeah<00:03:32.870> I'd<00:03:33.800> be<00:03:34.130> kind

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
almost like greed I think that'd be a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.000

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
m1911 than you are yeah you just swap

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.710 
m1911 than you are yeah you just swap
survive<00:04:37.460> with<00:04:37.610> m1911<00:04:38.540> um<00:04:39.790> this<00:04:40.790> game<00:04:41.120> mode<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
survive with m1911 um this game mode I

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.930 
survive with m1911 um this game mode I
think<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.440> pretty<00:04:42.590> hard<00:04:42.830> as<00:04:43.100> long<00:04:43.640> as<00:04:43.790> you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
think it's pretty hard as long as you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.570 
think it's pretty hard as long as you
have<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.840> can't<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.410> can't<00:04:45.650> go<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.070> party

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
have you can't you can't go with a party

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.420 
have you can't you can't go with a party
so<00:04:47.390> we're<00:04:48.110> just<00:04:48.140> I<00:04:48.380> like<00:04:48.560> make<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:48.980> sense<00:04:49.220> so

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
so we're just I like make this sense so

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.580 
so we're just I like make this sense so
if<00:04:49.730> someone<00:04:50.270> joins<00:04:50.540> your<00:04:50.690> party<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:51.140> can't<00:04:51.380> go

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
if someone joins your party you can't go

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.870 
if someone joins your party you can't go
in<00:04:51.770> with<00:04:51.980> them<00:04:52.190> because<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.490> guess<00:04:52.640> they<00:04:52.790> don't

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
in with them because I guess they don't

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.170 
in with them because I guess they don't
want<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.180> boosting<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:54.730> guess<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.850> can<00:04:55.970> still

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
want you boosting I guess you can still

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.710 
want you boosting I guess you can still
join<00:04:56.210> their<00:04:56.840> game<00:04:57.400> somehow<00:04:58.400> when<00:04:59.150> they<00:04:59.270> go<00:04:59.570> in

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
join their game somehow when they go in

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.230 
join their game somehow when they go in
I<00:04:59.930> appreciate<00:05:00.290> you<00:05:00.350> can<00:05:00.440> do<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.680> um<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:02.030> think

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.580 
I appreciate you can do that um I think
it'd<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.660> lot<00:05:02.780> fun<00:05:02.990> are<00:05:03.140> pills<00:05:03.320> with<00:05:03.470> your

putting me in DLCs with everyone else is

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.439 
putting me in DLCs with everyone else is
using<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.460> Peacekeeper<00:06:00.000> so<00:06:00.150> it's<00:06:00.270> kind<00:06:00.419> of

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
using the Peacekeeper so it's kind of

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.779 
using the Peacekeeper so it's kind of
hard<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:00.719> get<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.900> good<00:06:00.960> gameplay<00:06:01.529> because<00:06:01.789> it's
