for viola players is kind of a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.640 
for viola players is kind of a
trailblazer<00:00:42.489> in<00:00:42.699> many<00:00:43.000> ways<00:00:43.269> but<00:00:44.140> also<00:00:44.320> as<00:00:44.589> a

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
composer and just for someone to have

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.229

composer<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.070> viola<00:00:54.339> I<00:00:54.729> always<00:00:55.180> found

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
composer from the viola I always found

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.969 
composer from the viola I always found
particularly<00:00:55.839> inspiring<00:00:56.320> even<00:00:56.619> before<00:00:56.769> i

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
particularly inspiring even before i

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.469 
particularly inspiring even before i
came<00:00:57.159> into<00:00:57.670> composing<00:00:58.180> myself<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.670> he<00:01:00.670> was<00:01:00.850> you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
came into composing myself so he was you

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.630 
came into composing myself so he was you
know<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.780> significant<00:01:02.440> figure<00:01:02.769> for<00:01:03.040> me<00:01:03.190> as<00:01:03.430> I

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
know a significant figure for me as I

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.359 
know a significant figure for me as I
got<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.879> know<00:01:04.030> his<00:01:04.360> his<00:01:04.839> work<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.500> play<00:01:05.830> his<00:01:06.100> is

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
got to know his his work and play his is

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:14.710 
got to know his his work and play his is
viola<00:01:07.000> works

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.550 

I've<00:01:15.720> always<00:01:15.930> likened<00:01:16.650> composition<00:01:17.550> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
I've always likened composition to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940 
I've always likened composition to
filmmaking<00:01:20.510> because<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:21.930> sort<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> takes

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
filmmaking because it sort of takes

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
filmmaking because it sort of takes
place<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:24.030> unfolding<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
place in the unfolding of time and I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.810 
place in the unfolding of time and I
mean<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.880> mean<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:27.900> no<00:01:28.080> great<00:01:28.320> film<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.040> fishy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
mean I mean I'm no great film a fishy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.770 
mean I mean I'm no great film a fishy
and<00:01:29.910> oh<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.300> I'm<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> film<00:01:31.140> buff<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.800> love

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
and oh but I'm a film buff and I do love

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.360 
and oh but I'm a film buff and I do love
film<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.050> just<00:01:34.410> wonder<00:01:34.740> whether<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.130> might

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
film I just wonder whether that might

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.400 
film I just wonder whether that might
have<00:01:35.520> been<00:01:35.750> somewhere<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.810> might<00:01:37.080> have<00:01:37.200> gone

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
have been somewhere I might have gone

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:46.360 
have been somewhere I might have gone
had<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.830> not<00:01:38.070> been<00:01:38.510> taken<00:01:39.510> over<00:01:39.750> by<00:01:39.930> music

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.120 

well<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.840> plane<00:01:48.200> coming<00:01:48.620> over<00:01:48.980> from

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
well of a plane coming over from

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.450 
well of a plane coming over from
Australia<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:50.090> last<00:01:50.390> time<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:51.400> ended<00:01:52.400> up

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
Australia this last time I ended up

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.580 
Australia this last time I ended up
watching<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.970> entire<00:01:53.060> first<00:01:53.810> season<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.440> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
watching the entire first season of the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.740 
watching the entire first season of the
newsroom<00:01:55.210> I'd<00:01:56.210> been<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.540> fan<00:01:57.410> of<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.770> West<00:01:57.980> Wing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
newsroom I'd been a fan of the West Wing

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.010 
newsroom I'd been a fan of the West Wing
and<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.530> know<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.800> just<00:02:00.830> got<00:02:01.160> into<00:02:02.020> Aaron

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
and so you know I just got into Aaron

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.890 
and so you know I just got into Aaron
Sorkin's<00:02:03.470> stuff<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:05.330> was<00:02:05.450> fascinating

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
Sorkin's stuff and that was fascinating

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.020 
Sorkin's stuff and that was fascinating
certainly<00:02:06.800> passed<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.280> time<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.790> long-haul

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
certainly passed the time on a long-haul

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.800 
certainly passed the time on a long-haul
flight<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.890> don't<00:02:10.700> think<00:02:10.760> it's<00:02:11.000> quite<00:02:11.210> on<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
flight I don't think it's quite on the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.440 
flight I don't think it's quite on the
level<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.290> west<00:02:12.470> wing<00:02:12.710> but<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:14.180> got

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
level of the west wing but it's it's got

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.450 
level of the west wing but it's it's got
some<00:02:14.660> great<00:02:14.870> moments<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.440> must<00:02:15.650> say<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.070> you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
some great moments I must say and you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.820 
some great moments I must say and you
know<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.090> fascinating<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.750> see<00:02:17.900> that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
know it's it's fascinating to see that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.060 
know it's it's fascinating to see that
his<00:02:19.040> idealism<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.000> has<00:02:20.270> moved<00:02:20.480> from<00:02:21.070> politics

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
his idealism now has moved from politics

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.210 
his idealism now has moved from politics
to<00:02:22.250> Wells<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.600> next<00:02:23.930> door<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.710> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
fascinating stuff I also you know I like

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.130 
fascinating stuff I also you know I like
the<00:02:31.010> way<00:02:31.130> he<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.730> know<00:02:31.850> takes<00:02:32.150> stories<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.110> of

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
the way he you know takes stories out of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.830 
the way he you know takes stories out of
the<00:02:33.740> real<00:02:33.920> world<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.640> only<00:02:34.850> months<00:02:35.780> later

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the real world and only months later

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.680 
the real world and only months later
they<00:02:36.260> end<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.620> somehow<00:02:37.490> fictionalized<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
they end up somehow fictionalized and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.470 
they end up somehow fictionalized and
and<00:02:38.870> thur<00:02:39.680> matta<00:02:39.890> sized<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:41.060> way<00:02:41.240> it's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and thur matta sized in that way it's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.250 
and thur matta sized in that way it's
very<00:02:42.440> very<00:02:42.770> interesting

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
very very interesting

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.710 
very very interesting

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
that are underrated and actually

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.880 
that are underrated and actually
somebody<00:02:54.250> recently<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:55.060> asked<00:02:55.390> me<00:02:55.510> about
