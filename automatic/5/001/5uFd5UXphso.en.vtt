in<00:00:11.620> my<00:00:12.010> experience<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.780> a<00:00:14.260> hand<00:00:14.980> seat<00:00:15.309> she

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
in my experience the a hand seat she

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.269 
in my experience the a hand seat she
just<00:00:15.760> picked<00:00:16.029> my<00:00:16.209> hand<00:00:16.510> but<00:00:17.380> usually<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.830> sister

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
just picked my hand but usually a sister

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.439 
just picked my hand but usually a sister
token<00:00:19.380> token<00:00:20.380> pack<00:00:20.800> and<00:00:21.100> she's<00:00:21.550> not<00:00:21.760> likely<00:00:22.029> to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
token token pack and she's not likely to

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.880 
token token pack and she's not likely to
really<00:00:22.750> hurt<00:00:23.079> your<00:00:23.380> hand

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890
