 [Music] 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 a few weeks ago bolivia announced his 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.220
 decision to enter into development 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920
 of nuclear energy for purposes 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.990
 peaceful advances were not made 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.610
 wait and the president evo morals will 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.890
 met with a score of experts 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.939
 Bolivians to project the first 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.939
 steps in the matter 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.680
 The meeting discussed the creation of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.840
 a national nuclear center and he agreed 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.700
 collect proposals for a month to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.610
 continue with these meetings the 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.430
 criteria that they had regarding 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.440
 to the formation of this commission of 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.840
 nuclear energy that we want to conform 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.820
 in bolivia and good basically that is 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.350
 a very productive meeting practically 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.300
 everyone has agreed that this 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.460
 is carried out it seems to us it is accurate that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.190
 is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.400
 that this debate and also going through 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.800
 people of versaba that is of much the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 matter is now and so that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.000
 we have to take advantage of the future the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.830
 nuclear physicist silveiro chávez who was 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.990
 part of the meeting with the president 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 explained the two main uses that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.000
 they will give to nuclear power in the country 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.979
 we have two options one that 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.350
 take advantage of the thermal energy that 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.450
 develops that comes off in those of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.210
 fission action and there are the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.490
 nuclear power stations or we use 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.110
 as a neutron source where are they 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.910
 the research reactors chaves 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.070
 indicated that the development of this type of 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.479
 energy corresponds to the advances 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.840
 that are being carried out in Bolivia 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 we need to think of a central 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 electronuclear that we do not supply 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.720
 electric power with 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.700
 for the benefit of the poles of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.650
 development they think in our country 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.270
 the president evo morals has done 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 emphasize that the development of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.030
 Bolivian nuclear program will target the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
 electric power and also stressed that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.120
 Bolivian technicians will be those who carry 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.119
 forward this project 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.119
