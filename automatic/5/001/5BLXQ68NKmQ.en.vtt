00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
where we want to own the home home ice

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.190 
where we want to own the home home ice
building<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.180> our<00:02:27.330> ice<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.050> make

building it's our ice we want to make

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
building it's our ice we want to make
sure<00:02:28.230> win<00:02:29.099> lose<00:02:29.280> or<00:02:29.310> draw<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.700> other<00:02:29.970> team

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

think<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.769> style<00:02:32.010> suits<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.540> coming<00:02:33.540> in

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
think his style suits that coming in

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.840 
think his style suits that coming in
here<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.400> isn't<00:02:35.730> really

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
here because this is a this isn't really

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.430 
here because this is a this isn't really
a<00:02:35.970> road<00:02:36.180> building<00:02:36.569> for<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> lot<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.989> teams<00:02:37.230> with

ten hometown boys usually on every other

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.890 
ten hometown boys usually on every other
team<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:41.220> good<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.299> reminds<00:02:42.690> me<00:02:42.810> of
