00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.200
 People will be back from today 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.110
 your little gameplay for you and 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.029
 freestyle friday number four and im 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.899
 winter reason fathers this time a good one 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.500
 gameplay is played by benny action 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:37.430
 34 to zero team deathmatch on where hok 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.980
 with the memory with kempter plays along 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.059
 specialist 34 00 a bit something 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.769
 Is that ne knew it was but as always 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.480
 the gameplay is not in the foreground 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.730
 He will certainly be happy if he does 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.769
 his channel is out of checked gameplays 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.030
 me highscore know him game fields 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.030
 Something like that then stop by 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.670
 yes, in any case we have now 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.479
 since one week back is so 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.890
 back from the holiday well , there I am already 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.540
 longer but the holiday is you have too 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.780
 about both as I have the first one now 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 you have worked your whole week again 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 Well done but of course anyway 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.610
 will be the weekend and this time 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.549
 not all weather for the first time 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 actually quite cool but who 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.460
 It is not the spring that is to blame 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 The bike I have read here leads 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.229
 often with blah blah blah no idea 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 you push the whole shit with sand in 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.439
 the atmosphere and the vulture knows what 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.659
 that does not matter 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.770
 but that's all the same with 1900, by the way 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.850
 not me at home pretty much 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.240
 jerseys commercially but not pretty 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.000
 many jerseys collect nearly one already 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.259
 you can say a little 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.630
 that's why perhaps fearing times 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.189
 be that every friday video here new 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.460
 We have to look at figures for how long 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.460
 we persevere 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.560
 exactly what else happened a week 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.570
 not much more 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 is actually pretty much done 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.560
 been working after 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.570
 bavaria has played here so some of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.140
 you may not know in bavaria 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.910
 fan will not help put that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.380
 comments here 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.100
 I have always been a little bit since 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.130
 I can think and then the ball 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 played against manchester 1 1 0 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.070
 be satisfied but it should not be 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.350
 Football talk shit no matter if you 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.610
 Unfortunately, then, the bag will get understood 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.380
 We are still here yesterday 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.280
 rather long, I think that is watched 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.860
 on a stadium here bavaria basketball 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:52.290
 europe as euro league against tel aviv 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.820
 unfortunately, sad lost 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.459
 But what to do but because that 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.420
 first year of the young euroleague and there 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.110
 you have to be satisfied 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.790
 but as I said this weekend and 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.070
 That's why I'll be right on the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.750
 beginning with gambling I have mine 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.160
 yes I dare yesterday because of the even 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.380
 No time to use my new network 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.330
 but definitely wants to learn here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 exact but the new maps look 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.420
 and something like that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.860
 that will now then in connection 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.530
 make this video the same 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.430
 what 's often said 33 asked some 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.900
 when will it continue? 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 I did not talk nice to us 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.440
 both have shown bock finally 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.120
 to gamble and I hope for that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.220
 but he gets together for several weeks together 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 he pulls more often with kevin 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.670
 blah-blah 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.080
 I do not have that much time then should 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.930
 to introduce such a scheduler if 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.540
 you can set the dates 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.930
 but I think such a two hours would be 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.420
 maybe jump out on the weekend 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.020
 and then we can do a little bit more 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.070
 take up 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.380
 and some still asked if I was 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:59.030
 Pain in the pain tournament 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.670
 if this year I'm doing that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.580
 team almost the same so again at 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.010
 the raiders and only a small change 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.750
 since this time is playing in the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.930
 That's why we have the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.150
 unfortunately not there for it but yes 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.870
 good replacement of the fog smokings with the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.760
 State and the lot where we look something 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.019
 unfortunately we can have a tear 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.220
 Unfortunately, I do not know what the boys 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.450
 have no idea you have 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 already played cards but I still have 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.070
 no pain felt because 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.790
 before the 360 â€‹â€‹now I think so 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.419
 not again a few weeks 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.190
 turned 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.240
 there now must in any case I think 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.130
 next week is already that 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.060
 I have to definitely one more 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.460
 Giving a little gas 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.470
 practice a bit not that we are to 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.729
 disgrace 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.140
 I think we have to lose some luck as well 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.710
 we do not have that first round 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.190
 right here on kevin thiemo janssen that 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.810
 gets pretty annoying 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.950
 Nevertheless, I am looking forward to it and 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.120
 let's see if you bock that 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.400
 derogatory comments 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.440
 then I will upload the gameplay 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.780
 We also had the pain tournament 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.330
 Last year done so 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.110
 exactly 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.520
 what's left to say really 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.960
 not much the gameplay but not at all 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.220
 so long ago no strike is seen 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.740
 already reached and the skin then 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.270
 in or out wittmann 10 i like to come 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.909
 Unfortunately not to play boxy 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.070
 I had the week so relative again 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.620
 I have a lot to do 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.820
 besides not socially accepting but me 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.050
 I hope there is war on the line 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.050
 and can not be there 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.180
 bring some gameplay next week because 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.020
 her much power to, for example, right 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.430
 In any case, that's the same gameplay 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.570
 to the end and I'm looking forward to the same 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.570
 to gamble 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.910
 I would say you have a nice one 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.920
 weekend and we'll see each other 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.490
 latest next week with a new one 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.520
 Video 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.520
