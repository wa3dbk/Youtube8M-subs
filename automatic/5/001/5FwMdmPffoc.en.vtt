00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.080
 okay today a little explanation about it 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 use of terre tools 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 we also get a lot of questions through it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.860
 blog in of course about it there 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.870
 shooting in my opinion is one of the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 most important things 4 can do if you like 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.990
 photographs 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 in the star shooting but what 's in it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.109
 well we shoot lots of people 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.670
 that is not clear 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.519
 People think they are very expensive things 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.760
 need medium format cameras 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 or yes they just don't know 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.090
 hence i am in this little video 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 briefly explain what do you know 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 it shoots well actually it's first 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.010
 what i want to make clear is that it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 not expensive at all 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 stronger now if you did not know or 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.860
 using a camera you have the software 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 often already in your possession 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.620
 90% of people have it without it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.210
 know 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 just put the terret solution on them 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 computer in the case of aperture 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.670
 or light room 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.649
 can you actually know you already or 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 nikon camera connect with a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 USB cable and at that time you can already 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 busy and shoot toward the computer 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.120
 Do you have a different brand of camera? 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 look carefully if you can do that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.339
 counter 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.380
 For example, Sony has certain 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.880
 cameras with which it is possible and others 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 cameras with which I cannot 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 find this is equally good you have now 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 no live film or aperture and yes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 for example one knows a camera on you 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 solution disk you are a program that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.259
 it's called GDP with this program you can 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.820
 also directly to the shooting 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.500
 ok we now know that we have the software 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 did we know it probably 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 already on the computer is what you have now 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 need to go really strong shoot it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 The most important of course is the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 USB cable and as you know I used 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 There is advice and the tools are available throughout 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.579
 Nice USB cables that are special 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.899
 focus on it and shooting it 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 images 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.229
 not just take an example 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 extension cable of 10 meters 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 in the beginning i might be fine 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.479
 work a lot of people will say 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.770
 you know my ten meter cable is already working 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 years good 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 the disadvantage of a 10 meter cable is that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 this is actually not meant at all 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 for usb2 transfers actually lies the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.800
 border somewhere near the four four and a half 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.050
 meter 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.940
 yet there are the tools for example 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.560
 solutions that can be up to 10 meters 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.450
 and even longer 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.530
 these are the so-called usb repeater 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.420
 cables 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.860
 these usb the pieten cables are whole 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 easy to use 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.460
 and its not too expensive you can go there 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 just the cable of your camera 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.330
 click and at that time you can get up to 10 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.830
 meters from your laptop or computer 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.600
 off to the shooting 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.610
 If you want even further you could possibly have two 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.050
 can connect to each other of course 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.360
 They are also different lengths look 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 before that on the website 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.990
 and you need it further 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.550
 most important to the gate of you 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.960
 camera to protect is the so-called 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.090
 jerk stopper 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.710
 you see sitting on this knowledge 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.780
 actually the jerk is stop and nothing less 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.290
 as a kind of strain relief of your usb 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.870
 gate 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 he is not only on the camera but 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.380
 you can also see it in the laptop 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.870
 this is the usb version but they have 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.570
 one for example also for the rj45 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 or even just to the table on this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.240
 moment you have the connection between you 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 camera 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.470
 a laptop or computer in order you have 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 as it were the usb your repeater cable 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 there you click the cable that goes to the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.930
 camera goes and at that moment 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.120
 Critics Shooting 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.400
 another small tip there with some 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.470
 people tape and the bit between the usb 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.010
 repeater in the cable to their camera 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.530
 close 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.380
 I wouldn't do that if you were for example 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.209
 is on your camera or sorry if you are on you 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.650
 Kabelstraat then it may be that you 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.050
 with that your laptop for example from the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.450
 Terre pulls off the table at the moment 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.520
 you don't always get that connection 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.709
 jump off the connection you're on that 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.209
 lose your images but you have 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.950
 no problems getting the camera out of you 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.730
 hands or that the laptop falls to the floor 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.230
 falls 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.910
 try that connection so don't close it 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.980
 just leave it open 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.900
 the moment you are on your cable and you 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.760
 pull out your plug again you are 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.030
 lost your images but have further 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.500
 no damage 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 ok let's look at it now 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.330
 assortment of ter the tools I put on 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.000
 location use you can see my laptop here 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.130
 stand and macbook 17 spro 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.480
 on the table I use for that matter 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.670
 always the mat 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.440
 carrying that when you are outside and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.150
 light falls on a shiny 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.830
 monitor then you can see the images 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.600
 poor see so the mat is actually 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.709
 always my choice 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.670
 the there the tables are in there 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.200
 different sizes 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.090
 for example the traveler is suitable 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.770
 for a lot of laptops what I do 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.109
 user rights those who special 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.269
 intended for my 17 inch notebook 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.370
 it's because smaller table but the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.470
 laptop fitted exactly and makes one 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.780
 very nice whole in the table is happy 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.270
 not too heavy all terre cables 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.580
 are supplied with a connection kit 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.350
 with him on virtually any tripod 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.230
 studio tripod or try-pots can 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.390
 and it really worked the ideal way 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.830
 table itself is also very light and weather 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.770
 helps if you travel with, for example 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.419
 table to put the laptop in place 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.540
 keep using a so-called secure 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.070
 strip it runs over the laptop 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.350
 it becomes very simple at the second table 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.710
 clicked and at that moment you know for sure 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.870
 that your laptop has good snow on it 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.370
 see this side and so-called drive at 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.600
 here you can get different hard drives 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.370
 Bet 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.229
 this is the version for a hard drive 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.669
 but they are also for two 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.860
 one of the things because many people 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.960
 do not realize that a heart 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.210
 actually always broke alone 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.830
 you never know when the only thing 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.630
 What is certain is that it always happens on 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.130
 the moment you don't want to 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.470
 hence it is also very wise 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.030
 to make backups on location 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.560
 directly to your hard drive ' 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.510
 not very easy 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.550
 now is basically a directory to rot 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.500
 when you come to us you to 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.180
 it shoots and at that moment you make one 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.890
 little program what he god folder 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.110
 again copy to the external hard 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.070
 disk at that time you always have two 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.450
 backups are on your computer 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.490
 that also makes a difference when you get home or 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.960
 comes back in the studio that closes only 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.850
 but the hard drive and you already have 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.000
 that file is available in is not required 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.490
 also to connect your laptop to 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.410
 this side we see the so-called hook 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.270
 this hq for example your light meter 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.380
 or other things that it wants 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.000
 we go of course 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.700
 and one of the things that I mentioned first 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.830
 thought that will not be for me it 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.300
 so-called coffee cup holder 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.040
 and i hear you lay on that side it 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.450
 coffee cup holder that is really something like that 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.220
 American 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.110
 however, you do realize that you are mostly 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.950
 location always have drinks 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.840
 with us 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.030
 my case a bottle of water bottle of coke 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.890
 and if for example you are on the beach 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.320
 and she shoots that bottle somewhere else 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.370
 of course you don't have to 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.930
 tell what happens then 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.250
 you all have sand on the bottle and 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.440
 that ends in and of course gives me in 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.540
 your mouth and that is not tasty 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.640
 with this coffee cup holder you can too 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.410
 just neat use the bottle and as 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.820
 I view my photos on the laptop that 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.560
 is also often the moment that I want something 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.980
 drink and at that moment I have it 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.720
 always available 1 more thing in the ter 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.090
 the table is also a so-called 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.010
 protection cap de propres et i would 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.820
 personally always count this 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.400
 buy a table
