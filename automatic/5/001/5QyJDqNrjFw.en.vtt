00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.210
 cool colada so it's ours I 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.519
 gave him 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.410
 you'll see it's a very worry 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.059
 exotic and super refreshing high 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.390

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.850
 fresh cut pineapple prepare a banal 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.290
 coconut oil nothing charles 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.760
 manson for this one as well as 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.050
 the other coconut so you prepare your 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.239
 fruits you and diaper you cut 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.820
 of course take duets preferably 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.880
 if you could put your own 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.680
 in your blender 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 you will add your coconut water 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.220
 cool for something 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.800
 really refreshing and you 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.770
 can add for good fats 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.179
 a little bit of coconut oil 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.320
 so overall so it's a 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.899
 recipe really hyper rich in 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.450
 potassium in vitamins and oligo 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.160
 elements that's it's a mix sells 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.300
 great for the morning and you'll see 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.800
 it really gives me something 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.179
 very good stuff avoid as 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.179
 me to put everywhere is better 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.979
 so for this second recipe of 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.240
 worry I offer you a smoothie hyper 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.310
 rich in antioxidants 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.899
 it's really a super smoothie 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 greedy then for that you will need 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.670
 a banal of blueberries that are lo 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.630
 rich in antioxidants vitamins 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.610
 minerals etc 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.050
 small organic strawberries preferably and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.940
 walnuts whose good there I put nuts 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.770
 macadamia and could even quite 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.899
 almonds and brazil nuts etc 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.310
 so we but all the fruits 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.929
 in the blender for red fruits 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.259
 you can also put for example 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.610
 delirium timba of blueberry and men 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.360
 I have a short hole of other red fruits 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.459
 than the loved ones penalty shoot and lov 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.110
 very cool we mix everything so he 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.239
 must mix well to spray 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.610
 the pennies you put inside 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.800
 even on pulse power too 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.770
 on a bike on your blender and you 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.920
 get this little just super greedy 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.990
 concerning the third 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.000
 also so it's the green detox that 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.800
 I love these favorite msci clues of all 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 the times I do it all the time so 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.209
 there will be three fruits apples 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 pears and kiwis and vegetables 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.300
 so the avocado and the cucumber you 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
 can all end knowing that the lawyer is 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.170
 a trick anyway but you can everything 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.000
 a master of spinach shoots 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.290
 it's delicious but I had no under 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.819
 the hand because to the biocoop actually 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.350
 it's more of a fruit season so we do not 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.390
 find more but it's really great 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.410
 top so you put your fruits here 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.600
 peel cut 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.340
 you will do the same with your vegetables 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.110
 you put a quarter of lawyers and if 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.760
 never are you a greedy power 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.739
 put a little bit more it's going to be 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.780
 really a source of good fats 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.970
 it lowers the cholesterol it 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.500
 increases the good there is a lot of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 vitamins and minerals in this 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.260
 smoothie and especially the intake actually makes 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.720
 vegetables well limited source of sugar 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 fructose in this smoothie so it's 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 I thought you're not so sweet so 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.819
 that's why I like them so 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.200
 after it's a matter of taste but in 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.269
 any case for health that's it avoids 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.190
 be it a fructose bomb and that's 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.810
 rather interesting 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.579
 nutritionally speaking so you 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.120
 can quite iron in the morning to 4 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.510
 hours etc 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.430
 it depends on your tastes for the latter 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.489
 smoothie so I called Omega 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.920
 you power so it will take you a 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.650
 half apple half a banal full of 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.920
 small strawberries and flaxseed or 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.410
 of shiao vaugeois as you want so 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.870
 of course you prepare your fruits 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.890
 so this concern it is going to be very rich in 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.540
 Omega 3 and potassium from banana 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.100
 and the seeds so it's true that the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.820
 grains are more rich enough in 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.440
 protein 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.750
 so I recommend you put one 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.609
 tablespoon in a worry you in 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.840
 take twice a day of course 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.489
 you can add them to others 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.290
 worries that I did previously 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.910
 you mix all the seeds in 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.950
 absolutely not leaving or at the table 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.060
 writing in terms of you and there we 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.799
 gets something that looks 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.510
 really to a chair that's really 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.430
 very 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.080
 me and it's very greedy and but there is 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.210
 has absolutely no dairy products 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.230
 it's still pretty light and that's it 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.790
 I really hope this video 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.590
 recipe you will have enjoyed me I loved 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.040
 you film it is really 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.260
 receipts 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.690
 she's healthy for your body and 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.600
 I hope that the editing will have you 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.100
 been nice parts to me I do very 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.420
 close to kisses and I hear very 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.600
 soon in a new video chat

 chalet
