00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 daniel brühl once more in one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 International production is there too 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.450
 see in the first trailer to the eyes of the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.450
 Engels here speaks Thomas long 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.440
 I read your book from her 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 At the beginning of this report one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.220
 english students or draw at the place 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.349
 remain neutral or guilty or innocent 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.089
 I do not go to the face I always think 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.089
 to elisabeth but someone all jessica 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.739
 before court was very simplified 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.390
 Jessica was the bad girl and 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.829
 elisabeth the good girl do you have from 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.670
 jessica iv or should that still be heard 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.290
 a doku I want her off 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.320
 could see back in the belly of the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.729
 last if you want to meet him 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.219
 Can I arrange that against him 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:54.120
 pay you believe me since the 1 with 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 this story makes money 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 why should she be innocent 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 only a woman would accuse you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.339
 Body cover the respite 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 she is intelligent, she does that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.190
 murderess 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 what was the motive they have the wrong ones 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.830
 people in the wrong order 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.830
 condemned what do you think 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 It is important to face death 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.080
 see 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.200
 if you understand life where you are 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 always last night 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100
 I 'm worried 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.960
 1 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.330
 Maybe you are right maybe 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.870
 yes, some victims he has me 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.870
 the house shown 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.300
 really thrown off track or 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.570
 very exciting and dramatic 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.070
 although I am a bit skeptical as 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.600
 the trailer does not really care much about that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.790
 the film in the innermost tells and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.530
 to reflect mood but that 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.600
 whole is not a thriller but a 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.250
 drama and then it really comes 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.320
 on the content construction to the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.270
 eyes of the angel brings us concorde 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.370
 movie rental is expected on the 21st 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 may 2015 in German cinemas and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.600
 tells the story of Thomas first 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.100
 director he believes in a current 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.900
 murder case in which an American 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.060
 student together with her friend one 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.530
 the roommate is said to have killed the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.940
 just right fabric for his new 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.010
 to have found a movie for a 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.209
 he travels to Italy 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.220
 There, a woman learns about the woman 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.810
 In this case also before court the whole 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 time was present this case was studied 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.350
 wrote a book about it and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.450
 little by little doubts arise 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.310
 the question who, what, when, where and who 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.840
 is the actual killer and as 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.640
 someday after a student the way 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.080
 it is clear that the question mark crosses 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.790
 are bigger than originally thought 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.350
 that you only have this construction 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.480
 changed so a bit to the father 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 maddox and the angel with the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.989
 ice eyes from the year 2007 and there has 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 Just make a few connection if 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.440
 you look at the basic structure and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 at the core the question becomes this film 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.380
 has 21 times in the know 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.180
 a bit more but daniel brühl 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.860
 is so one of the international 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 stage can shine really well at 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.430
 big production here among other things, 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.329
 Kate Beckinsale at his side and he 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 speaks fluent german english 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.079
 Spanish still some languages ​​more and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.180
 is also almost international over 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.829
 more successful than in this country and thus 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.269
 I can say at the end sees a well so 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.829
 movie for cineastes thought that 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.850
 not reach the big audience 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.470
 and then probably not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.780
 but inevitably in the cinema must see how 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.100
 said no later than 21 may we know 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.630
 More and the question could be my skepticism 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.010
 disguise or interest you the film 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.660
 very much let me know 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.980
 because I'm through at this point last 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.790
 like a thumbnail in this trailer 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.650
 Jaccottet 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.019
 Let's not leave it that otherwise 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.000
 important to a few left and tomorrow around 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.100
 15 clock, of course, at the latest, a new one 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.560
 video and until then I hope are times 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.560
 of course again at 3
