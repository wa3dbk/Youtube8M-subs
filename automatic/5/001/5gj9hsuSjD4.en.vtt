00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.649
 the guts decide to save 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.229
 cars from destruction they take their

 classic double 165 server era 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 exits the museum on stage and helps 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.640
 the main character is escaping up to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 happy end for the car also 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.030
 characteristic futuristic technology 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.009
 such as multi vector suspension 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.719
 wheels and gak's technology maktec 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 with light magnetic surfaces 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.380
 which can move quickly creating 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.229
 solid roof surface and clean up 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.640
 what makes the car transform them 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.439
 inspiration will emphasize her from the world 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 feature films are also noticeable 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.770
 because the project was developed and was 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.509
 attached to the original outline were 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.789
 converted to complete illustration 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.590
 it hints at the style of work done 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.420
 concept artists who will be in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.039
 entertainment industry and literally 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.960
 creates a storyboard that represents 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.770
 history and provides a clear vision 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.220
 atmosphere and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 film war 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.670
 Gaming value mercedes-benz a silver 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 lightning three hundred twenty five thousand 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.340
 credits max pumping cost 417,500 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 and for pro tuning we need 6 tires 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.170
 suspension transmission and exhaust from class 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.330
 as well as 12 electric motors 8 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.060
 intermediate technology 8 advanced and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.470
 730 5810 credits for their installation in 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.690
 playing silverlight is not 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.220
 electric vehicle average acceleration average 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.080
 duration and subway and bad 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.239
 handling some of you now 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.459
 think wow wow do not drive your horses 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.780
 in general what the machine is not so bad with her 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.180
 much higher characteristics 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.769
 the thing is that silver was added in 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 the game is one of the first cars 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.190
 I can even say the flagship of the class 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 then all the players tried to accumulate 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 credits to buy it and pump it in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.069
 max but now two years later with a date 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.720
 release of the game there are a lot of cars 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.730
 and ascendants those first were 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.380
 added at the very beginning on their background 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.640
 silver hunt looks old but 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.970
 still remains one of the most 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.500
 popular at the moment also 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.910
 this car is one of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 the best options for 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.000
 passing single player especially this 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.859
 model will suit beginners 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.930
 on it you will easily go through all the races with 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.700
 class including competition electric cars 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.350
 besides you can fuck on it 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.959
 loans in the ninth season and pump 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.070
 leave to participate in promotions 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.540
 periodically appear medium cup 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.609
 Classes where this may be needed 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.810
 lightning fellow yes of course for 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.880
 rookie three hundred twenty five thousand 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.440
 loans save up hard but how to 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.090
 I'd rather podkopit on the server than in 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.180
 empty spend these loans on ferrari 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.769
 fxx bugatti or agira and if you 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.269
 wondering whether silver 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.269
 feels comfortable in a network game 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.709
 then the answer is no silver for the net too 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.810
 outdated in that round where does it go 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.470
 you will be quite difficult to win 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.940
 other players 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.940
 having weak characteristics 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.220
 let's start by tradition with acceleration acceleration 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.810
 silver lightning is slightly above average 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.240
 comparing with the last added 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.010
 silver cars are already outdated but even 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.360
 despite the time he has far from 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.230
 worst acceleration you class 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.150
 the car’s handling is not very 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.040
 enough twisted liters turns 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.630
 enters hard but has good 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.580
 stability on the track and small 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.100
 drift entry radius which is also 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.570
 good value apparently silver 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.920
 set up in opposition to weights 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.260
 as ogera slowly accelerates 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.190
 has good handling the seller 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.110
 set up the opposite but the metro guys are 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.730
 An interesting case for some reason I always 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.470
 it seemed that not krakow silver very 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.480
 long if none of the best in the game 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.000
 it turns out that the mood is the same 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.500
 like ferrari f-50 even lotus exige 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.010
 and he pointed holds nothing better than 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.010
 silver 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.030
 Tutsi 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.520
 top speed mercedes-benz 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.300
 silverlit them max pumping 471 kilometers 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.969
 per hour with a set of tuning the maximum speed in 479 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.250
 max opponents will be 493 of sets 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:33.370
 tuning accelerates to 500 3 kilometers in 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.560
 hour in season 9 we are waiting for the route of dubai 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.110
 reverse and two simple tasks to beat time 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.110
 race minute 03 and perform two knockdowns 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.789
 if you have not bought this car yet 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.559
 buy download immediately max and pro 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.449
 I remind you that he is one of the most 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:41.639
 sought after in the game since 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.779
 useful for stocks for season 9 format 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.149
 and finally a way to pass 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.889
 single player on this i have everything 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:48.659
