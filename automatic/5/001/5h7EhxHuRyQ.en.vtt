three bad bricks one to represent

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.889 
three bad bricks one to represent
hardwork<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> represent<00:02:09.000> smartness<00:02:09.720> and

one<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.619> represent<00:02:10.830> strength<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
one to represent strength so this is the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.090 
one to represent strength so this is the
living<00:02:12.810> room<00:02:12.840> area<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.410> don't<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> dining

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.860 
living room area we don't have a dining
table<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:14.880> usually<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.510> everyone

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
table so what we usually do is everyone

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.300 
table so what we usually do is everyone
sits<00:02:16.080> around<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.440> table<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.920> eat<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
sits around this table to eat and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400 
sits around this table to eat and
sometimes<00:02:17.880> even<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.300> work<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.080> don't<00:02:19.230> have

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
sometimes even do work and we don't have

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.080 
sometimes even do work and we don't have
a<00:02:19.440> TV<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.920> front<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> sofa<00:02:20.520> because<00:02:20.940> we

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
a TV in front of the sofa because we

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520 
a TV in front of the sofa because we
don't<00:02:21.209> want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> sit<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> sofa<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> watch<00:02:22.200> TV

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
don't want to sit on a sofa and watch TV

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.830 
don't want to sit on a sofa and watch TV
that<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.280> unproductive<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.690> I'm

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that is very unproductive so what I'm

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.240 
that is very unproductive so what I'm
thinking<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.320> maybe<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.709> put<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> to-do

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
thinking is maybe you can put a to-do

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.650 
thinking is maybe you can put a to-do
list<00:02:26.459> here<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.850> then<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.180> sit<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> sofa

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
list here and then we sit on the sofa

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
list here and then we sit on the sofa
look<00:02:27.990> at<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> to-do<00:02:28.440> list<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.740> we're<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
look at the to-do list and we're like we

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.620 
look at the to-do list and we're like we
have<00:02:29.400> work<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:29.820> they<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.150> off<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.450> this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
have work to do they get off and this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.750 
have work to do they get off and this
