simpler for the customers and you know

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.899 
simpler for the customers and you know
when<00:02:30.719> you're<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.170> there<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.639> bought<00:02:32.879> a

there<00:02:35.790> maybe<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.689> only<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:37.049> one<00:02:37.290> hand<00:02:37.319> free

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
there maybe you only have one hand free

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.289 
there maybe you only have one hand free
because<00:02:38.159> your<00:02:38.310> other<00:02:38.400> hands<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.879> your<00:02:39.000> ski

having<00:02:42.180> Auto<00:02:42.389> Scene<00:02:42.719> Recognition<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.889> great

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
having Auto Scene Recognition is great

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
having Auto Scene Recognition is great
whether<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.819> take<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> close-up<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.989> flower

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
whether you take a close-up of a flower

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.899 
whether you take a close-up of a flower
or<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> picture<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.220> your<00:02:47.370> friend<00:02:47.639> with<00:02:47.790> the

or a picture with your friend with the
Sun<00:02:48.120> behind<00:02:48.299> them<00:02:48.689> wherever<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.049> point<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
Sun behind them wherever you point the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
Sun behind them wherever you point the
camera<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.430> stated<00:02:51.030> earlier<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.540> camera

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
camera as you stated earlier the camera

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.440 
camera as you stated earlier the camera
adjusts<00:02:52.379> automatically<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.909> can't

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
adjusts automatically for it so I can't

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.839 
adjusts automatically for it so I can't
say<00:02:54.659> enough<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:54.989> how<00:02:55.980> much<00:02:56.129> freedom<00:02:56.579> this

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
say enough for how much freedom this

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.729 
say enough for how much freedom this
gives<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.510> worry<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:57.959> composing<00:02:58.469> your

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
gives you to worry about composing your

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.830 
gives you to worry about composing your
picture<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.489> holding<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.269> camera<00:03:00.419> steady

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
picture and holding your camera steady

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.420 
picture and holding your camera steady
and<00:03:01.079> letting<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.439> camera<00:03:01.650> worry<00:03:02.010> about<00:03:02.250> all

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and letting the camera worry about all

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.459 
and letting the camera worry about all
the<00:03:02.579> exposure<00:03:02.969> aspects<00:03:03.719> that's<00:03:03.959> right<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.379> it

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
the exposure aspects that's right and it

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.409 
the exposure aspects that's right and it
incorporates<00:03:05.069> technology<00:03:05.909> like<00:03:06.180> face

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
incorporates technology like face

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.929 
incorporates technology like face
detection<00:03:06.620> technology<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.400> does<00:03:08.609> help<00:03:08.879> to

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
detection technology so it does help to

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.539 
detection technology so it does help to
determine<00:03:09.689> if<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.319> picture<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> portrait

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
determine if that picture is a portrait

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.819 
determine if that picture is a portrait
by<00:03:11.669> determining<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> face<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.810> subject<00:03:13.379> in

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
by determining a face in the subject in

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.830 
by determining a face in the subject in
that<00:03:13.919> scene<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.359> course<00:03:15.629> you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
that scene that is and of course you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.240 
that scene that is and of course you
know<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:16.079> face<00:03:16.290> detection<00:03:16.709> there's<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.099> lot

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
know what face detection there's a lot

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.280 
know what face detection there's a lot
of<00:03:17.340> features<00:03:17.699> that<00:03:17.729> you<00:03:17.879> can<00:03:18.060> use<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.720> top<00:03:19.109> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
of features that you can use on top of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.439 
of features that you can use on top of
that<00:03:19.379> in<00:03:19.530> terms<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.979> your<00:03:20.220> playback<00:03:20.699> removing

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
that in terms of your playback removing

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.240 
that in terms of your playback removing
redeye<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:21.780> stuff<00:03:22.169> like<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.739> that's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
redeye and stuff like that so that's

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
feature that we call trimming for blog

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.659 
feature that we call trimming for blog
and<00:05:07.300> really<00:05:07.870> all<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.529> does<00:05:08.830> is<00:05:09.099> that<00:05:09.370> it

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
and really all that does is that it

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.390 
and really all that does is that it
allows<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.900> resize<00:05:11.379> the<00:05:11.620> image<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.250> the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
allows you to resize the image so the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.800 
allows you to resize the image so the
camera<00:05:12.729> takes<00:05:12.939> you<00:05:13.090> know<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.270> image<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.629> at<00:05:13.779> a

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
camera takes you know the image is at a

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.019 
camera takes you know the image is at a
10<00:05:14.469> megapixel<00:05:14.860> being<00:05:15.340> its<00:05:15.490> full<00:05:15.699> resolution

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
10 megapixel being its full resolution

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.869 
10 megapixel being its full resolution
but<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.110> will<00:05:17.259> resize<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.860> image<00:05:18.129> to<00:05:18.159> a<00:05:18.370> VGA

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
but it will resize the image to a VGA

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.809 
but it will resize the image to a VGA
resolution<00:05:18.939> of<00:05:19.539> about<00:05:19.599> 640<00:05:20.349> by<00:05:20.469> 480<00:05:20.919> which<00:05:21.610> is

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
resolution of about 640 by 480 which is

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.760 
resolution of about 640 by 480 which is
you<00:05:22.029> know<00:05:22.120> extremely<00:05:22.569> small<00:05:22.900> but<00:05:23.229> good<00:05:23.529> enough

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
you know extremely small but good enough

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.760 
you know extremely small but good enough
to<00:05:23.979> view<00:05:24.189> on<00:05:24.370> on<00:05:24.669> sites<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.539> Facebook<00:05:26.050> when

you're not gonna slow anyone down what's

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.209 
you're not gonna slow anyone down what's
kind<00:05:28.810> of<00:05:28.839> unique<00:05:28.930> about<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.650> trimming<00:05:30.099> for

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 
kind of unique about this trimming for

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:31.709 
kind of unique about this trimming for
blog<00:05:30.490> mode<00:05:30.789> is<00:05:30.969> that<00:05:31.210> there's<00:05:31.389> actually

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
blog mode is that there's actually

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.320 
blog mode is that there's actually
special<00:05:32.199> effects<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:33.460> can<00:05:33.610> do<00:05:33.789> so<00:05:34.060> in

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
special effects that you can do so in

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.059 
special effects that you can do so in
that<00:05:34.539> mode<00:05:34.810> if<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.050> just<00:05:35.289> do<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.740> little<00:05:35.949> quick

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
that mode if I just do a little quick

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.140 
that mode if I just do a little quick
picture<00:05:36.580> here<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:38.009> I<00:05:39.009> play<00:05:39.400> back<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.849> image

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
picture here and I play back that image

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.559 
picture here and I play back that image
I<00:05:40.419> actually<00:05:40.930> opened<00:05:41.379> up<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.589> option<00:05:42.099> for<00:05:42.569> the

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
I actually opened up the option for the

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.079 
I actually opened up the option for the
trimming<00:05:44.020> for<00:05:44.199> blog<00:05:44.469> mode<00:05:44.770> so<00:05:45.580> it's<00:05:45.909> right

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
trimming for blog mode so it's right

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.839 
trimming for blog mode so it's right
here<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.389> select<00:05:46.810> it<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.259> right<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.919> now

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
here I select it to the right and now

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.999 
here I select it to the right and now
not<00:05:49.419> only<00:05:49.750> can<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:49.990> trim<00:05:50.319> the<00:05:50.469> image<00:05:50.770> but

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
not only can I trim the image but

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.469 
not only can I trim the image but
there's<00:05:51.129> actually<00:05:51.279> different<00:05:51.759> effects<00:05:52.210> that

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
there's actually different effects that

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.269 
there's actually different effects that
you<00:05:52.870> can<00:05:52.900> do<00:05:53.169> with<00:05:53.349> the<00:05:53.469> image<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.919> if<00:05:54.039> I<00:05:54.099> just

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
you can do with the image and if I just

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.429 
you can do with the image and if I just
close<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.699> scroll<00:05:55.449> through<00:05:55.479> some<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:56.379> the

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
close to scroll through some of the

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.689 
close to scroll through some of the
effects<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.919> can<00:05:57.099> do<00:05:57.219> there's<00:05:57.400> actually

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
effects that you can do there's actually

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.089 
effects that you can do there's actually
a<00:05:57.759> aspect<00:05:58.240> ratio<00:05:58.659> feature<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.229> can<00:05:59.800> change

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
a aspect ratio feature that can change

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.909 
a aspect ratio feature that can change
the<00:06:00.310> aspect<00:06:00.460> ratio<00:06:00.759> from<00:06:01.300> say<00:06:01.569> a<00:06:01.599> 4<00:06:02.469> to<00:06:02.560> 3<00:06:02.710> ratio

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
the aspect ratio from say a 4 to 3 ratio

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.439 
the aspect ratio from say a 4 to 3 ratio
which<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.490> standard<00:06:03.729> ratio<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.300> this

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
which is the standard ratio of this

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.279 
which is the standard ratio of this
camera<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.529> 16<00:06:06.039> by<00:06:06.219> 9<00:06:06.250> or<00:06:06.879> even<00:06:07.389> a<00:06:07.479> 3<00:06:07.689> 3<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.139> 2

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
camera to a 16 by 9 or even a 3 3 to 2

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.350 
camera to a 16 by 9 or even a 3 3 to 2
ratio<00:06:08.529> which<00:06:08.860> is<00:06:09.009> more<00:06:09.159> like<00:06:09.339> a<00:06:09.370> 4<00:06:09.639> by<00:06:09.759> 6<00:06:09.789> print

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
ratio which is more like a 4 by 6 print

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.300 
ratio which is more like a 4 by 6 print
you<00:06:11.169> can<00:06:11.259> change<00:06:11.529> the<00:06:11.680> brightness<00:06:11.830> of<00:06:12.189> the

you can change the brightness of the

image if you wanted to you can change

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
the image tomb of a CPS tone so you can

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.100 
the image tomb of a CPS tone so you can
make<00:06:21.219> it<00:06:21.370> little<00:06:21.550> more<00:06:22.120> old-fashioned

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
make it little more old-fashioned

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.990 
make it little more old-fashioned
looking<00:06:23.529> there's<00:06:24.219> even<00:06:24.430> an<00:06:24.520> illustration

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
looking there's even an illustration
