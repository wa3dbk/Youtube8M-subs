stroke motion and what you're doing is
you're<00:02:58.890> creating<00:02:59.130> kind<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:01.460> beam

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
you're creating kind of like a beam

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.270 
you're creating kind of like a beam
effect<00:03:02.910> coming<00:03:03.360> from<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> center<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:07.280> what

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
effect coming from the center and what

and<00:03:11.790> things<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:12.750> when<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.990> pull<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and things in it so when you pull it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.740 
and things in it so when you pull it
from<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.440> center<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.800> get<00:03:14.100> multiple<00:03:14.880> lines

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
from the center you get multiple lines

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.420 
from the center you get multiple lines
and<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:17.550> go<00:03:18.050> all<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.290> way<00:03:19.320> around<00:03:19.500> some<00:03:20.370> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and just go all the way around some of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.570 
and just go all the way around some of
them<00:03:20.550> will<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:20.880> darker<00:03:21.330> than<00:03:21.450> others<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:28.580> you

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
them will be darker than others and you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.260 
them will be darker than others and you
start<00:03:29.910> seeing<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.890> kind<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.980> sunburst<00:03:32.730> type

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
start seeing that kind of sunburst type

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.740 
start seeing that kind of sunburst type
of<00:03:33.420> effect<00:03:33.720> happening<00:03:34.820> then<00:03:35.820> last<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.450> get<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
of effect happening then last you get a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.740 
of effect happening then last you get a
heart<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.200> nice<00:03:37.410> hard<00:03:37.970> eraser<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.120> could<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.450> a

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
heart a nice hard eraser it could be a

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.220 
heart a nice hard eraser it could be a
clicky<00:03:40.410> racer<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> could<00:03:41.550> be<00:03:41.730> any<00:03:42.480> any<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.080> of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
clicky racer it could be any any kind of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.560 
clicky racer it could be any any kind of
like<00:03:43.500> real<00:03:43.920> firm<00:03:44.600> ed<00:03:45.710> firm<00:03:46.710> edged<00:03:47.390> eraser<00:03:48.390> and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
like real firm ed firm edged eraser and

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.730 
like real firm ed firm edged eraser and
from<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.200> center<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.800> could<00:03:49.950> create<00:03:50.190> a

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
from the center you could create a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.130 
from the center you could create a
harder<00:03:52.740> brighter<00:03:53.610> lines<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.270> I'm<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:54.960> going

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
harder brighter lines and I'm just going

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.680 
harder brighter lines and I'm just going
to<00:03:55.170> go<00:03:55.440> right<00:03:55.890> down<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.250> middle<00:03:56.280> there<00:03:57.710> and

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
to go right down the middle there and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:15.949 
to go right down the middle there and
you<00:04:00.690> can<00:04:00.810> make<00:04:00.990> them<00:04:01.110> thick<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.620> thin

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.279 

and<00:04:16.959> then<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:17.919> can<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.639> some<00:04:18.940> free<00:04:19.329> form<00:04:19.660> just

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
and then you can do some free form just

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.460 
and then you can do some free form just
without<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:24.389> straight<00:04:25.389> edge<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.870> then<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
without the straight edge and then the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.719 
without the straight edge and then the
center<00:04:26.860> you're<00:04:27.009> going<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.190> be<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.340> brightest

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
center you're going to be the brightest

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.960 
center you're going to be the brightest
so<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:27.940> can<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:29.430> pick<00:04:30.430> up<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.789> lot<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.030> that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
so you can really pick up a lot of that

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:42.960 
so you can really pick up a lot of that
graphite<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.630> can<00:04:37.780> see<00:04:38.020> how<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:42.669> can<00:04:42.759> see

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
graphite and you can see how you can see

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.900 
graphite and you can see how you can see
how<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:43.180> get<00:04:43.389> that<00:04:43.919> kind<00:04:44.919> of<00:04:45.009> sunburst<00:04:45.430> effect

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
how we get that kind of sunburst effect

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.310 
how we get that kind of sunburst effect
and<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.360> want<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.690> can<00:04:46.780> go<00:04:46.840> back<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.289> with
