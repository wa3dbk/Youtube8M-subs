these new cyberverse figures are
actually<00:03:30.269> incredibly<00:03:31.269> impressive<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.890> I'm

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
actually incredibly impressive and I'm

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.470 
actually incredibly impressive and I'm
saying<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.519> cuz<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.760> actually<00:03:33.939> thought<00:03:34.269> these

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
saying that cuz I actually thought these

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.199 
saying that cuz I actually thought these
were<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.930> be<00:03:35.019> pretty<00:03:35.170> rubbish<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:37.090> in

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
were going to be pretty rubbish but in

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.479 
were going to be pretty rubbish but in
the<00:03:37.299> end<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.409> always<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.950> proven<00:03:39.310> wrong

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the end you can always be proven wrong

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.349 
the end you can always be proven wrong
in<00:03:39.549> some<00:03:39.879> form<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:42.340> here<00:03:42.579> we<00:03:42.670> have<00:03:42.700> bulkhead

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
in some form but here we have bulkhead

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.190 
in some form but here we have bulkhead
super<00:03:44.109> cool<00:03:44.319> sort<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:44.739> dinky<00:03:45.129> actually<00:03:45.519> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
super cool sort of dinky actually and

super cool sort of dinky actually and
really<00:03:47.200> amazing<00:03:47.620> how<00:03:47.739> they<00:03:47.889> can<00:03:48.010> actually

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
really amazing how they can actually

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.699 
really amazing how they can actually

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
gaping hole in his back so yeah there's

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:10.379 
gaping hole in his back so yeah there's
that<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:07.440> fix<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.560> up<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.940> we<00:04:10.269> will

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
that and fix that up there and we will

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.270 
that and fix that up there and we will
move<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.139> Dark<00:04:11.440> Lord<00:04:11.650> if<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
move on to the Dark Lord if the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.460 
move on to the Dark Lord if the
Decepticons<00:04:13.590> mega<00:04:14.590> shrine<00:04:15.099> oh<00:04:16.109> yeah<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
Decepticons mega shrine oh yeah and

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.659 
Decepticons mega shrine oh yeah and
obviously<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.650> do<00:04:20.829> have<00:04:21.010> these<00:04:21.130> translucent

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
obviously you do have these translucent

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.510 
obviously you do have these translucent
weapons<00:04:22.539> to<00:04:22.630> actually<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.289> remove<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.159> stuff

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
weapons to actually can remove and stuff

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.129 
weapons to actually can remove and stuff
and<00:04:24.699> you<00:04:25.210> can<00:04:25.330> still<00:04:25.539> have<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.870> figures

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
and you can still have the figures

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.250 
and you can still have the figures
themselves<00:04:26.520> but<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.849> Megatron<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.930> actually

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
themselves but and Megatron is actually

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.950 
themselves but and Megatron is actually
just<00:04:29.409> pretty<00:04:29.680> amazing<00:04:30.159> and<00:04:30.720> if<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.810> actually

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
just pretty amazing and if I actually

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.469 
just pretty amazing and if I actually
move<00:04:32.289> in<00:04:32.789> you'll<00:04:33.789> get<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:33.970> better<00:04:34.120> view<00:04:34.360> of

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
move in you'll get a better view of

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.680 
move in you'll get a better view of
Megatron<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.050> way<00:04:35.229> but<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.849> actually

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
Megatron that way but and I actually

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.990 
Megatron that way but and I actually
find<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.320> there<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.680> lot<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.340> detail<00:04:39.729> here

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
find that there is a lot of detail here

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.460 
find that there is a lot of detail here
um<00:04:40.300> pretty<00:04:41.110> much<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:42.599> almost<00:04:43.599> the<00:04:43.750> exact<00:04:44.320> same

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
um pretty much the almost the exact same

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.350 
um pretty much the almost the exact same
as<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.039> TV<00:04:45.250> shows<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:45.880> that's<00:04:46.090> pretty

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
as the TV shows so that's pretty

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.110 
as the TV shows so that's pretty
impressive<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:47.789> but<00:04:48.789> the<00:04:48.880> biggest

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
impressive and but the biggest

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.089 
impressive and but the biggest
difference<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.139> actually<00:04:50.320> take<00:04:50.680> what

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
difference and if I actually take what

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.399 
difference and if I actually take what
was<00:04:51.310> an<00:04:51.460> old<00:04:51.639> legends<00:04:52.360> figure<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:53.020> know<00:04:53.139> and

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
was an old legends figure you know and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.879 
was an old legends figure you know and
those<00:04:54.400> for<00:04:55.330> any<00:04:55.630> transformers<00:04:56.169> founds<00:04:56.590> who

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
those for any transformers founds who

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.689 
those for any transformers founds who
were<00:04:57.280> found<00:04:58.060> before<00:04:58.740> 2011<00:04:59.740> you<00:05:00.220> will<00:05:00.430> remember

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
were found before 2011 you will remember

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.779 
were found before 2011 you will remember
that<00:05:01.000> we<00:05:01.120> call<00:05:01.360> these<00:05:01.570> figures<00:05:02.050> legends<00:05:03.010> so

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
that we call these figures legends so

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.870 
that we call these figures legends so
here<00:05:04.060> we<00:05:04.180> have<00:05:04.289> transformers<00:05:05.289> cybertron

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
here we have transformers cybertron

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.100 
here we have transformers cybertron
legends<00:05:06.880> red<00:05:07.090> alert<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:08.610> really<00:05:09.610> am<00:05:10.080> well<00:05:11.080> I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
legends red alert and really am well I
