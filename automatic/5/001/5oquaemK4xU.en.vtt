00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 no no 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.009
 volkswagen jetta of 2002 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.439
 basically the first thing you say is 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.169
 that changes the aesthetic part has everything 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 a boycott of widening fenders 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.820
 later strikers guard shocks 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.329
 and then the changes began to be made 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 in the mechanical part it has suspension 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 changed improved shock absorbers 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 spiral bars and then modified the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.670
 part of the 1.8 turbo engine that now 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 250 horsepower is instead part 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 of air intake is what is 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.970
 called intake exhaust outlet 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 the whole system of 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.079
 pulley exhaust intake system all 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.780
 type of improvements for the car to render 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.260
 more have better performance 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.080
 in as much in highway as in city it is 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.420
 very important 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 first love your car you have to love 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.860
 to your car and when you're going to make a 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.470
 auto auto modification is to improve it 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.410
 not to make it worse 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.780
 is to modify what is already standard 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.270
 but for good because you're never going to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.150
 modify anything for evil then this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.600
 can go from the minor vehicle 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.270
 cost 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.250
 up to what both bmw venues enjoy 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.720
 waste until painting some hoops is already 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 start the car 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.090
 the cars 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 the topic 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.360
 it has caught my attention 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.770
 but really never 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.590
 they came from where we're going 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 when we see how much I told you that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.570
 you will not buy it with the most basic 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 possible 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.110
 at that time I did not think content 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.989
 from very small in an influence by 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 my grandfather who liked very much the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.150
 cars I always liked the most part 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.129
 mechanics 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.689
 my first montero car is what I was 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.860
 also modifying in the future this 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.420
 car 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.370
 and what I wanted was to improve 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 benefits a volkswagen jetta in the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.140
 subway a very heavy car and does not have a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.060
 so good suspension then that was 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.040
 trying to improve the performance the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.020
 idea was and trying to go changing 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.150
 pieces that will improve performance both 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 on the road as in the city 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.129
 at the moment of running the curve the moment 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.680
 to stop this change 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:52.459
 suspension pads look here came more 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.730
 or less in the year 2003 2004 but I that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.420
 I come from Argentina I come dreaming of my 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.700
 cars from citroÃ«n 12 see the fia 600 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.709
 750 was that you know 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.750
 that I was already cutting to shock him 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.640
 He pulled the mask forward 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.769
 did the upholstery painted everything and what 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 we put down in Argentina always the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.209
 characteristic was to put the car on the floor 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 what pleases you the most is to put the car 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.530
 on the floor here a lot of people like it 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.139
 raise the cars but the tuning always 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.510
 down because the car got a lot more 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.250
 nice downstairs flush with the floor 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.030
 taking our first one if it was 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.030
 easy 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.920
 and that's where he taught me 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.920
 to group 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.300
 at that moment 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.640
 passion was always 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.800
 the change was always what 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.130
 they gave it now it's a stylish environment 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.690
 commercial if they sell you audio they sell you 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.960
 they sell you the speakers they sell 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.160
 at 17 before existing at 17 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.680
 we have to make the hoop 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.260
 to be different to turn the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.830
 center for the tires to come out a 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.830
 a little more 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.340
 so I know 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.910
 and in all the mechanical part of the car and 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.910
 to art 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.300
 who has been 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.169
 and let's be the street we started for a year 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.419
 through the street 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.020
 Then he just gave me the opportunity 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.409
 to do charitable works 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.949
 and then we started already all year 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.950
 although in the street garcÃ­a the track without 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.690
 commentary 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.009
 I have a little crazy with a career that 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.779
 there was nothing extra spikes plus mistakes 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.200
 and then with the time that we wanted 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:57.900
 make hot 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.890
 people who do not know that it's logical that 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.420
 do not know look at that and say a crap 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.430
 then when tunning balls winning 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.050
 do not just give stupidity, they are 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.139
 crazy, foolish or pass it on 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.930
 running around in the car 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.909
 so we have to fight against that and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.469
 I should not be able to fight against that but 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.539
 it seems that it has become so commercial 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.210
 I do not put the bumper on you 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.380
 I know what I do not know how much and to the other the one 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.570
 in which he does not know but does not know anything 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.700
 it's like when you put a ring on 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.190
 magnesium in a vehicle that you do not get 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.010
 serves the magnesium ring is I can you 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.500
 put on a suit or a tuxedo if you 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.580
 I grab you and put you walking rubber shoe 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.580
 al andate of marriage
