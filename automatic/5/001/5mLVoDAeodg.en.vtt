00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.790
 as a newcomer here is where 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.309
 turn around you see I took the format 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:53.270
 horizontally to the most delicious places 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:58.640
 here it is the sea and the moon light these lunar 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:01.629
 highlights so that the most delicious though 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.820
 I didn't occupy any place on the map 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.320
 took here the horizontal that these strings of waves 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.370
 delicious pee and that in this emptiness 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.760
 I had too much there with us 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.140
 orange. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.250
 and finally a yellowish stain 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 the moon itself that is the distant water fingers 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.969
 not shaken 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.789
 and all the vibrations accumulated in the area 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.140
 foreground 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:39.380
 these are the front manifestations 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.750
 nakata water already looks like dinner and this 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.750
 mean they behave 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 and here such trajectory flies 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.780
 inadvertently nasty sound good night 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.009
 allows this whole thing to twinkle and not be 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.039
 written and beautiful at the same time 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.940
 slip a little green soup 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.069
 show warm water 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.319
 little color has therefore become 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.520
 gives you the opportunity to lay like this 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.770
 dry cheesy 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.860
 Well, if you could not do it 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.860
 put then you just take the palette knife and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.060
 put again on this place 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.240
 as yellow if 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:41.410
 shuffle with blue will turn green 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 what we don't need here is this warmth 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.080
 moonlight from the horizon line 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:57.340
 the same brush can be walked and 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:02.530
 in a dream not and paints calm show 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:08.440
 teme in this gap between the wave and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.040
 lying water so as not to paint him 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.730
 facial difficulties 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 give him a light unshaven such a 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 homely unshaven and our couple 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.500
 somewhat reflected in this glass 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.980
