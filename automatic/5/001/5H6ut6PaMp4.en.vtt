 but then what we are talking about today 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 today we talk about two foods that 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.160
 serve in my opinion but I have inquired 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.039
 so maybe if then as you always have 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.929
 something to add or that of 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.709
 carlo you want under the information box 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.770
 you can write everything then let's talk about 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.750
 two types of foods that serve for the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.390
 health of our friends and particular 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.770
 we said honey and garlic 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.980
 let's start with honey 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.700
 then the honey that if I have to be 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.860
 sincere million that makes me so much 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.270
 go crazy that there is no life either 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.370
 like and nothing is true, however , honey 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.950
 is good is good for both human and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.050
 to the animal what is going anyway 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.330
 a natural product with very few 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.100
 calories 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.170
 first of all it does not create imbalances 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.520
 food for our amighetti with the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.910
 light then helps the risk or out Iraqi 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.290
 helps them breathe and also helps 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 digestion 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.750
 in this product however since it has a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.090
 very strong and at the same time 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.400
 I also smell particularly strong 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.010
 I advise you to put a little bit each 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.140
 so much about the foods they love 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.630
 right as i know to say generated 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.060
 the moment on the little rusks 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.360
 because above all china and a lot 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.740
 fussy so with difficulty I can 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.880
 pray to her the best way 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.000
 it is true vineyard it is true we make it 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.200
 we can't make it because we are 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120
 very good 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.840
 yesterday we did and cuddles of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.300
 an estimate or mine so a little you have to do the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.490
 dirty bath then the Milan e 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.930
 I recommend we pass instead to 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.880
 second product which is oil, garlic 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.670
 apart from that lario are the bruschetta a 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.150
 my opinion for the most part the widow 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.209
 however, lario is a product 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.400
 really rich, rich in substances 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.860
 natural is in fact called 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.850
 natural antibiotic what it does to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:09.400
 laglio lario kill the germs kill 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.200
 bacteria and suitable for digestion is 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.989
 view however the intestine therefore a 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.359
 natural and more useful disinfectant 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.419
 also for breathing because it punishes 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.940
 the bronchi cleans the lungs the ways 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.370
 respiratory short tryo Ã¨ of a 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.770
 infinite wealth and if you put it on 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.160
 the real bread you eat is even better 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.229
 obviously if you live like you are married 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.030
 don't do it if then in the evening where you can succeed 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:40.430
 with your partner with yours 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:43.970
 mate if not you know that it is therefore 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.370
 garlic is very very very very rich 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.350
 and also very practical to find 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.600
 therefore not seeing antibiotics 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.300
 natural and that does not cost a bang of the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.640
 money and accessible to all as it comes 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 prepared the garlic and here I turn of 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.930
 bang in antonella clerici or whoever it seems 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.729
 to you to put the recipe then me 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.030
 move to the side that you slap the 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.130
 recipe then there are two solutions there 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.200
 first emit a spicchietto of garlic 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.570
 in the veil put the morning and the 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.270
 evening later he gave the problem now is what he does 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.979
 however the water begins to buy 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.810
 just the smell of the air then the 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.720
 satisfying it could also be a little 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.390
 loath the second method which is much more 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.990
 However, it was prepared with excellent results 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.780
 this is where you take 70 grams of garlic 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.640
 and chop it and put it well 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.990
 inside a glass of water 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.830
 hot 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.890
 leave it in hot water for 12 hours 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.890
 after 12 hours put the glass 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.669
 within a liter of normal water 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.340
 you mix goods and that book will be water 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.039
 what you will give to your parrots do 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:00.440
 this rose for six consecutive days 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:04.669
 per month but made the recipe mud god 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:10.760
 my god how many songs you do though 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:12.979
