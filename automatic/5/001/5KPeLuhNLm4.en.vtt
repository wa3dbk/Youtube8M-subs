so you can go on and take that full

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400 
so you can go on and take that full

come<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.740> library<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.190> take<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.640> can

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
come to the library to take and you can

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910 
come to the library to take and you can
do<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.000> anytime<00:02:53.540> you'd<00:02:53.900> like<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.500> anywhere

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
do it anytime you'd like from anywhere

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.860 
do it anytime you'd like from anywhere
you'd<00:02:55.070> like<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.270> word<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.720> you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
you'd like you know the word that you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.260 
you'd like you know the word that you
used<00:02:57.190> repetitively<00:02:58.190> which<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.970> think<00:02:59.060> is

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
used repetitively which I just think is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.020 
used repetitively which I just think is
the<00:02:59.450> key<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.870> access<00:03:00.500> access<00:03:00.890> access<00:03:01.490> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the key it's access access access and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030 
the key it's access access access and
that's<00:03:02.480> really<00:03:02.870> what<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.680> internet<00:03:04.010> is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
that's really what the internet is

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.060 
that's really what the internet is
making<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.520> possible<00:03:04.700> isn't<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:06.070> opening

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
making it possible isn't it it's opening

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.910 
making it possible isn't it it's opening
the<00:03:07.220> doors<00:03:07.430> wide<00:03:07.730> open<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:08.510> access<00:03:09.290> not<00:03:09.890> just

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the doors wide open to access not just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.450

the records and the databases but that

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.390 
the records and the databases but that

I<00:03:53.270> can<00:03:53.480> do<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.200> late<00:03:54.530> at<00:03:54.680> night<00:03:54.890> hour

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
I can do it in that late at night hour

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.950 
I can do it in that late at night hour
when<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.730> kids<00:03:56.000> are<00:03:56.150> asleep<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.720> finally

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
when the kids are asleep and I finally

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.020 
when the kids are asleep and I finally
get<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.230> moment<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.650> myself<00:03:57.770> that<00:03:58.250> that's<00:03:58.790> a

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
get a moment to myself that that's a

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.400 
get a moment to myself that that's a
that's<00:03:59.270> key<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.690> helping<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.020> get<00:04:00.170> more

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
that's key to helping you get more

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.560 
that's key to helping you get more
people<00:04:00.800> involved<00:04:01.040> than<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:01.910> those<00:04:02.300> who<00:04:02.480> are

more successful more quickly and coming

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.910 
more successful more quickly and coming
to<00:04:08.300> better<00:04:08.450> conclusions<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.650> love<00:04:09.890> that

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
to better conclusions and I love that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.650 
to better conclusions and I love that
because<00:04:10.190> that's<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.820> other<00:04:11.030> side<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.480> the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
because that's the other side of the

because that's the other side of the
access<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.740> no<00:04:13.670> matter<00:04:13.790> how<00:04:13.910> much<00:04:14.210> you

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
access is that no matter how much you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.660 
access is that no matter how much you
make<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.660> available<00:04:14.870> if<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:16.100> still<00:04:16.460> is

make it available if it still is

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.570 
make it available if it still is
tremendously<00:04:17.420> time-consuming<00:04:18.140> then<00:04:18.859> those

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
tremendously time-consuming then those

or two hours a week a person could make
it

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
it

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
it
and<00:04:29.699> they<00:04:29.880> could<00:04:30.030> learn<00:04:30.180> something<00:04:30.570> new<00:04:30.750> this

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and they could learn something new this

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.840 
and they could learn something new this
week<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.889> would<00:04:32.040> help<00:04:32.190> further<00:04:32.580> their

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
week that would help further their

think we're getting there have one piece

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.360 
think we're getting there have one piece
at<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> time<00:04:38.639> so<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.919> internet<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.160> the
