00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
switch between a couple of profiles on

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.539 
switch between a couple of profiles on
the<00:03:25.290> keyboard<00:03:26.130> itself<00:03:27.950> ultimately<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.519> that

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the keyboard itself ultimately what that

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.180 
the keyboard itself ultimately what that
does<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.120> allow<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.510> configure<00:03:30.840> up<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.829> 50

does is allow you to configure up to 50

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.610 
does is allow you to configure up to 50
macro<00:03:32.609> configurations<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:34.200> you've<00:03:34.319> got<00:03:34.470> your

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
macro configurations so you've got your

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.319

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
and then switching the profile will

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.009 
and then switching the profile will
switch<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.120> function<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.540> these<00:03:39.690> keys<00:03:39.989> and

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
switch the function of these keys and

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.750 
switch the function of these keys and
they<00:03:40.440> can<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.680> preset<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.220> any<00:03:41.370> configuration

out<00:03:49.609> we<00:03:50.609> all<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.000> set<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.269> our<00:03:51.389> own<00:03:51.419> macros

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
out we all get to set up our own macros

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.099 
out we all get to set up our own macros
and<00:03:52.230> switch<00:03:52.470> easily<00:03:52.769> between<00:03:52.980> them<00:03:53.840> most<00:03:54.840> of

and switch easily between them most of
you<00:03:55.200> guys<00:03:55.410> are<00:03:55.470> probably<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:56.040> more<00:03:56.220> interested

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
you guys are probably be more interested

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.979 
you guys are probably be more interested
in<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:56.970> fact<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.389> allows<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.750> easily

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
in the fact that it allows you to easily

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.960 
in the fact that it allows you to easily
switch<00:03:58.380> your<00:03:58.680> keys<00:03:58.889> between<00:03:59.160> one<00:03:59.579> game<00:03:59.790> and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
switch your keys between one game and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330 
switch your keys between one game and
another<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.930> your<00:04:01.079> macros<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.650> Call<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:01.980> Duty

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
another so your macros for Call of Duty

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.680 
another so your macros for Call of Duty
will<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.639> totally<00:04:03.060> different<00:04:03.209> from<00:04:03.480> your

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
will be totally different from your

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.690 
will be totally different from your
Starcraft<00:04:04.260> micros<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:04.980> at<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.639> stage

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
Starcraft micros and at this stage

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.580 
Starcraft micros and at this stage
changing<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.569> around<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.989> just<00:04:07.200> gonna<00:04:07.290> be<00:04:07.470> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
changing it around is just gonna be the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.020 
changing it around is just gonna be the
touch<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.040> button<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:10.669> one<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.880> other

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
touch of a button so one of the other

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.710 
touch of a button so one of the other
things<00:04:12.329> that<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:14.459> absolutely<00:04:15.359> beautiful<00:04:15.690> just

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
things that is absolutely beautiful just

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.469 
things that is absolutely beautiful just

first of all the anti-ghosting features
particularly<00:04:46.570> particularly<00:04:47.570> impressive

were for those of you who don't know the
the<00:04:50.810> anti-ghosting<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.470> very<00:04:51.650> much<00:04:51.800> like<00:04:51.950> a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
the anti-ghosting is very much like a

the anti-ghosting is very much like a
sticky<00:04:52.370> keys<00:04:52.610> on<00:04:52.790> your<00:04:52.880> keyboard

example the Q and the W keys would be

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.159 
example the Q and the W keys would be
pressed<00:05:07.640> together<00:05:08.180> rather<00:05:08.480> than<00:05:08.600> lifting<00:05:08.900> it

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
pressed together rather than lifting it

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.950 
pressed together rather than lifting it
up<00:05:09.230> that<00:05:09.710> might<00:05:09.860> be<00:05:10.010> something<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.960> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
up that might be something that the the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.230 
up that might be something that the the
more<00:05:12.140> hardcore<00:05:12.669> gamers<00:05:13.669> out<00:05:13.790> there<00:05:13.850> would

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
more hardcore gamers out there would

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
more hardcore gamers out there would
would<00:05:14.960> be<00:05:15.080> interested<00:05:15.800> in<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:17.630> talk<00:05:17.810> more<00:05:18.080> a

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
would be interested in to talk more a

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.870 
would be interested in to talk more a
little<00:05:18.560> bit<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.160> response<00:05:19.580> time<00:05:19.850> so

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
little bit about the response time so

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.880 
little bit about the response time so
the<00:05:20.270> blade<00:05:20.450> itself<00:05:20.810> has<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.140> thousand<00:05:21.710> Hertz

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
the blade itself has a thousand Hertz

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.230 
the blade itself has a thousand Hertz
polling<00:05:22.280> rate<00:05:22.430> which<00:05:22.610> gives<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.000> a<00:05:23.060> one

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
polling rate which gives it a one

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.760 
polling rate which gives it a one
millisecond<00:05:23.840> response<00:05:23.930> time<00:05:24.410> for<00:05:24.560> every

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
millisecond response time for every

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.000 
millisecond response time for every
keystroke<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:26.050> basically<00:05:27.050> guys<00:05:27.320> this<00:05:27.740> means

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
keystroke and basically guys this means

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.130 
keystroke and basically guys this means
that<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.430> can<00:05:28.580> no<00:05:28.730> longer<00:05:28.940> blame<00:05:29.240> lag<00:05:29.510> on<00:05:29.840> your

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
that you can no longer blame lag on your

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.850 
that you can no longer blame lag on your
terrible<00:05:31.040> terrible<00:05:31.280> reaction<00:05:31.880> time<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:33.740> of

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
terrible terrible reaction time and of
