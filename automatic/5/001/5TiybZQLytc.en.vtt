anatomical chart company and fourth
quality<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.139> means<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.770> lesser<00:00:17.220> version

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
of a first quality which means you could
not<00:00:19.949> use<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.550> medical<00:00:20.730> demonstration

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
not use it for medical demonstration

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.410 
not use it for medical demonstration
it's<00:00:22.350> probably<00:00:22.920> good<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.519> lower<00:00:24.029> level

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

it's probably good for lower level
education<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.439> certainly<00:00:25.769> wouldn't<00:00:26.039> do

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
education but you certainly wouldn't do

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
quality so there's a lot of flash all

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.440 
quality so there's a lot of flash all
over<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> place<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> parts<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.030> clean

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
cocked off to the side and that's okay

of twine and it basically holds all this

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
of twine and it basically holds all this
together<00:02:00.479> sometimes<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> pop<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> off

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
falls apart so what you can fix it if

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.150 
falls apart so what you can fix it if
you're<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.630> make<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> prop

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you're going to make it to a prop

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
you're going to make it to a prop
moving<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.850> down<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.570> can<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:18.900> this

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
moving on down here you can see this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.290 
moving on down here you can see this
piece<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.130> upper<00:02:20.490> rib<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:20.970> broken

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
piece of this upper rib here is broken

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.560 
piece of this upper rib here is broken
and<00:02:22.070> typically<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.640> happens<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.150> shipping

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
and typically that happens in shipping

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.720 
and typically that happens in shipping
or<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.620> don't<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.190> together<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
or they just don't put it together so

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.860 
or they just don't put it together so
well<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.240> final<00:02:27.750> assembly<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.470> all<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.740> parts

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
well so final assembly of all the parts

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.300 
well so final assembly of all the parts

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
unless or faulty is make it's what makes

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
unless or faulty is make it's what makes
it<00:02:32.490> fourth<00:02:32.730> quality<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.260> move

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it fourth quality and here you can move

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
it fourth quality and here you can move
down<00:02:34.440> here<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.250> not<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.730> typical<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.480> see

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
down here this is not a typical you see

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.110 
down here this is not a typical you see
how<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.930> broken<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:38.520> doesn't<00:02:38.640> matter<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
how it's broken it doesn't matter you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.540 
how it's broken it doesn't matter you
can<00:02:39.180> epoxy<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.780> back<00:02:39.930> together<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.130> larger

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
can epoxy it back together on a larger

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
can epoxy it back together on a larger
view<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.300> tell<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.990> rib<00:02:43.200> cage<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
view you can tell this rib cage is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
view you can tell this rib cage is
offset<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:44.880> crooked<00:02:45.150> first<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:45.900> it's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
offset it's crooked first of all it's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.230 
offset it's crooked first of all it's
depressed<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> it's

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
depressed in a little bit and it's

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.680 
depressed in a little bit and it's
shifted<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.930> left<00:02:50.120> that's<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:51.330> happens

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
shifted to the left that's what happens

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.910 
shifted to the left that's what happens
when<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:51.990> either<00:02:52.050> put<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.470> together<00:02:52.590> when

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
when they either put it together when

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.100 
when they either put it together when
the<00:02:52.980> parts<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.430> warm<00:02:53.640> or<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.660> parts<00:02:54.959> were

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the parts are warm or the parts were

the parts are warm or the parts were
came<00:02:55.410> out<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> mold<00:02:55.950> crooked<00:02:56.400> they<00:02:56.880> don't

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
came out with a mold crooked they don't

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.610 
came out with a mold crooked they don't
care<00:02:57.240> how<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.420> go<00:02:57.660> together<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.410> fourth

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
care how they go together it's a fourth

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.910 
care how they go together it's a fourth
quality<00:02:59.000> okay<00:03:00.000> moving<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.390> down<00:03:00.920> missing

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
quality okay moving on down missing

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
quality okay moving on down missing
parts<00:03:02.220> are<00:03:02.370> hardware

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
parts are hardware

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.890 
parts are hardware
this<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.330> very<00:03:03.540> typical<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:05.700> mounting<00:03:06.630> part

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
this is very typical this mounting part

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.510 
this is very typical this mounting part
that<00:03:07.200> holds<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:07.770> pieces<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.220> pelvis

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
that holds the two pieces of the pelvis

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.970 
that holds the two pieces of the pelvis
together<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.830> particularly<00:03:10.830> bad

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
together this is a particularly bad

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.310 
together this is a particularly bad
example<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.239> missing<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
example because it's just missing the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.680 
example because it's just missing the
screw<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:14.370> typically<00:03:14.820> when<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.120> goes<00:03:15.330> this

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
screw but typically when this goes this

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.930 
screw but typically when this goes this
goes<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.230> all<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.650> apart<00:03:17.010> yep<00:03:17.610> put<00:03:17.850> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
goes and all this is apart yep put it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.199 
goes and all this is apart yep put it
together<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.390> screw<00:03:18.660> same<00:03:19.500> thing<00:03:19.709> here

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
together with a screw same thing here

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.140 
together with a screw same thing here
this<00:03:21.209> little<00:03:21.510> part<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.380> attaches<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this little part that attaches the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.800 
this little part that attaches the
sacrum<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.140> pelvis<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.950> pulled<00:03:26.340> through

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
sacrum to the pelvis it's pulled through

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.720 
sacrum to the pelvis it's pulled through
because<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.050> it's<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.769> fragile<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.459> there

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
because it's it's a fragile part there

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.000 
because it's it's a fragile part there
it's<00:03:30.209> generally<00:03:30.780> ripped<00:03:31.050> through<00:03:31.200> there<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it's generally ripped through there and

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.470 
it's generally ripped through there and
you<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.340> come<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.670> with<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.820> sheet<00:03:33.030> roster

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
you have to come in with a sheet roster

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.110 
you have to come in with a sheet roster
or<00:03:33.630> something<00:03:33.959> bind<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> from<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> back<00:03:35.120> let's
