00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
it might not look like we're still in

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.919 
it might not look like we're still in
the<00:00:12.000> intel<00:00:12.269> booth<00:00:12.420> because<00:00:12.540> we're<00:00:12.690> looking<00:00:12.840> at

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
the intel booth because we're looking at

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
the intel booth because we're looking at
a<00:00:12.990> car<00:00:13.200> dash<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.719> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
a car dash right now but we are and it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
a car dash right now but we are and it
sounds<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.139> Intel's<00:00:16.619> working<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.070> some

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
sounds like Intel's working on some

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.390 
sounds like Intel's working on some
really<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.880> cool<00:00:18.210> in-car<00:00:18.840> technology

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
really really cool in-car technology

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
rundown on it and it sounds pretty

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.730 
rundown on it and it sounds pretty
ambitious<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.500> almost

breaks<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.860> great<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
breaks for you that's great because it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
breaks for you that's great because it
seems<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.360> such<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> simple<00:01:06.689> solution<00:01:07.350> really

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
seems like such a simple solution really

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
seems like such a simple solution really
cuz<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> probably<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.060> wouldn't<00:01:09.330> probably

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
cuz you probably I wouldn't probably

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
trying to figure out how do you get all

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.050 
trying to figure out how do you get all
these<00:01:11.070> cars<00:01:11.340> communicate<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.909> each<00:01:11.970> other

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
these cars communicate with each other

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
these cars communicate with each other
and<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.409> come<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> idea

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and you guys have come up with the idea

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.030 
and you guys have come up with the idea
this<00:01:14.400> simple<00:01:14.729> idea<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.390> using<00:01:15.570> LED<00:01:16.409> lights<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this simple idea of using LED lights so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
this simple idea of using LED lights so
that<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.640> direct<00:01:18.060> car<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> car

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that you have direct car to car

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
that you have direct car to car
communication<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.830> absolutely

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
communication right there absolutely

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.710 
communication right there absolutely
absolutely<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> see<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
absolutely and if you can see from the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
absolutely and if you can see from the
back<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.530> LED<00:01:22.860> lights<00:01:22.890> lit<00:01:23.340> up

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
back here you see some LED lights lit up

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
back here you see some LED lights lit up
and<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.509> passing<00:01:25.110> traffic

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and that that's actually passing traffic

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
and that that's actually passing traffic
right<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.189> prototype<00:01:26.580> LED<00:01:27.000> lights

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right now these are prototype LED lights

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.179 
right now these are prototype LED lights
passing<00:01:27.869> data<00:01:27.960> traffic<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.500> our<00:01:28.530> sensors<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
passing data traffic to our sensors so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
passing data traffic to our sensors so
that's<00:01:29.610> car<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> car<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> street<00:01:30.720> light<00:01:30.750> to
