effective way of killing them on my

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380 
effective way of killing them on my
personal<00:01:52.770> experience<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> crossbow<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
personal experience is the crossbow it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.340 
personal experience is the crossbow it
is<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.399> really<00:01:56.399> random<00:01:56.909> thing<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is a really random thing I know but the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
is a really random thing I know but the
crossbow<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.890> soon<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> stick<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.579> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
crossbow as soon as you stick them it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.450 
crossbow as soon as you stick them it
will<00:02:00.329> kill<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.770> soon<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.130> explodes

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
will kill them as soon as it explodes

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.760 
will kill them as soon as it explodes
even<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.000> flak<00:02:03.210> jacket<00:02:03.600> same<00:02:04.560> goes

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
even if they have flak jacket same goes

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.370 
even if they have flak jacket same goes
for<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> semtex<00:02:06.000> grenade<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> crossbow

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
for the semtex grenade but the crossbow

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.479 
for the semtex grenade but the crossbow
is<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> lot<00:02:07.619> easier<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
is a lot easier to use and you have a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.510 
is a lot easier to use and you have a
lot<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.869> attempts<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.020> sticking<00:02:10.739> them<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
lot more attempts on sticking them so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.070 
lot more attempts on sticking them so
give<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.150> shot<00:02:12.239> I'll<00:02:12.599> leave<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> clip<00:02:12.989> with

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
have a class ready always just try to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.820 
have a class ready always just try to
throw<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> c4<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.750> something<00:02:24.989> at<00:02:25.110> them<00:02:25.290> it

shield<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.420> couple<00:02:54.540> tips<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.110> have

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
shield there's a couple tips that I have

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.570 
shield there's a couple tips that I have
to<00:02:55.350> recommend<00:02:55.560> I'll<00:02:55.920> leave<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.190> class<00:02:56.340> photo

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
to recommend I'll leave the class photo

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.800 
to recommend I'll leave the class photo
that<00:02:56.790> was<00:02:56.850> using<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.239> top<00:02:57.420> right-hand<00:02:57.630> corner

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that was using the top right-hand corner

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.559 
that was using the top right-hand corner
I<00:02:58.400> find<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.730> most<00:03:00.060> effective<00:03:00.390> class

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
I find it's the most effective class

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.039 
I find it's the most effective class
that<00:03:00.750> i<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.110> use<00:03:01.680> well<00:03:02.130> ride<00:03:02.760> shielding<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
that i can use well ride shielding it

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.990 
that i can use well ride shielding it
