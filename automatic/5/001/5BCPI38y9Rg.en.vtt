just<00:01:02.320> cuts<00:01:02.680> straight<00:01:03.070> through<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.520> all

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
nice precise steering so you can really

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.950 
nice precise steering so you can really
throw<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.830> about<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.100> bit<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:19.240> hull<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.690> grips

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
throw it about a bit the hull just grips

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.670 
throw it about a bit the hull just grips
and<00:01:20.200> grips<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.570> leans<00:01:22.900> nicely<00:01:23.440> into<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and grips this leans nicely into the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.680 
and grips this leans nicely into the
turn<00:01:25.590> never<00:01:26.590> seems<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.009> slam<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.540> got<00:01:28.659> a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
turn never seems to slam it's got a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.740 
turn never seems to slam it's got a
resin<00:01:29.050> infused<00:01:29.440> hull<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:31.180> feels<00:01:31.420> really

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
resin infused hull so it feels really

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.219 
resin infused hull so it feels really
nice<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.049> light<00:01:32.440> but<00:01:32.470> also<00:01:32.830> very<00:01:33.310> strong

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.239 

and<00:01:39.700> then<00:01:39.880> when<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.119> really<00:01:40.390> want<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.600> turn

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.980 

so<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.950> wind<00:02:07.160> e39<00:02:07.700> Chimaera<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.450> all<00:02:08.720> about
