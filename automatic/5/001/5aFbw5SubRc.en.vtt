00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.890 
reload you press the gun once and to
throw<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> grenade<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.710> press<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> grenade

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900

so<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.870> thought<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.200> would<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.790> up<00:03:09.500> how<00:03:10.500> about

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so I thought it would be up how about

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.480 
so I thought it would be up how about
just<00:03:12.900> your<00:03:13.020> try<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.290> alright<00:03:14.130> then<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.370> have

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
just your try this alright then you have

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.980 
just your try this alright then you have
you<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:14.970> knife<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:17.910> basically<00:03:18.810> the
