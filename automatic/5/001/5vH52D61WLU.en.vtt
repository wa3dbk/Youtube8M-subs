this car is a unique prototype that was

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.519 
design for the otherwise two-door trial
parallel<00:00:20.510> it's<00:00:21.510> unique<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.410> never

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
parallel it's unique because it never

fact triumph didn't need to produce it
in<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> UK<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.539> already<00:00:27.689> had<00:00:28.109> small

there was a need for a small four-door
saloon<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.520> went<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:38.940> production<00:00:39.180> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it well it is the archetypal bonfire

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
it well it is the archetypal bonfire
this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.220> dragged<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> barn

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

this is as it was dragged out of a barn
and<00:01:06.570> there's<00:01:07.470> quite<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> debate<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.400> on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and there's quite a debate going on

and there's quite a debate going on
within<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> club<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.500> should<00:01:10.530> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
within the club as to what we should do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.609 
within the club as to what we should do
with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> car<00:01:11.280> should<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.180> restore<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
with the car should we restore it and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
with the car should we restore it and
produce<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.580> pristine<00:01:15.090> shiny

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
produce something that's pristine shiny

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
produce something that's pristine shiny
brand-new<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.470> could<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> displayed<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
brand-new which could be displayed in a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.240 
brand-new which could be displayed in a
museum<00:01:17.610> taken<00:01:18.210> around<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.570> events<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.320> should

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
museum taken around to events or should

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
museum taken around to events or should
we<00:01:20.340> simply<00:01:20.670> prefer<00:01:21.030> preserve<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> ass

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
we simply prefer preserve it in the ass

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.280 
we simply prefer preserve it in the ass
pound<00:01:22.409> state<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.390> but<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> argument<00:01:24.960> really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
display car that's all bright new or

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600 
display car that's all bright new or
would<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.750> better<00:01:30.960> simply<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.890> preserve

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
would it be better simply to preserve

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
would it be better simply to preserve
the<00:01:33.210> prototype<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.770> were<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the prototype if we if we were to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
the prototype if we if we were to
restore<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> original

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
restore it a lot of the original

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
restore it a lot of the original
prototyping<00:01:37.530> work<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.310> cut<00:01:38.729> up

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
prototyping work is going to be cut up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.870 
prototyping work is going to be cut up
redone<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> thrown<00:01:39.720> away<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> car<00:01:41.369> risks

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
redone the thrown away and the car risks

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
redone the thrown away and the car risks
becoming<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.329> replica<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> itself<00:01:43.079> rather<00:01:43.409> than

the true prototype after and so for that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
moment the funds that we are not

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.340 
moment the funds that we are not
available<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.630> carry<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> full

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
available to carry out a full

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.230 
available to carry out a full
restoration<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.610> moment<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.000> cars

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
restoration so for the moment the cars

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.330 
restoration so for the moment the cars
going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.690> preserved<00:02:18.960> as<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> stands<00:02:19.620> good

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
going to be preserved as it stands good

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.730 
going to be preserved as it stands good
stuff<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.000> has<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> stay<00:02:21.600> restoration<00:02:22.530> for

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
stuff so it has a stay restoration for

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.590 
stuff so it has a stay restoration for
time<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.820> does<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.210> know<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
think it would be nice if it stays that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.560 
think it would be nice if it stays that
