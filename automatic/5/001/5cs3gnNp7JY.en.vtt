00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.179
 hello good afternoon from emilio tuñón 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.240
 I'm a hundred that teto de madrid 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.310
 i worked with luis moreno mansilla in which marcelo mansilla and tuñón 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 neither 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.169
 in principle I would not like to thank 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.019
 Alberto life 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.189
 daniel 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 of the invitation to participate in this one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 meeting of Spanish and European architecture 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.710
 I also want to thank you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 I presented here because it really is an honor 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.640
 for all of us because of all Spain is not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.680
 establish relations with Argentina and with the Quentin director 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.330
 to which we have deep admiration 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.170
 and I have had a fluid relationship between the two 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.230
 p 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.650
 professionals from other countries 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.010
 CD 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.240
 I go I do not know if 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.040
 one of the networks of a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.230
 come to evil 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.670
 little long conversation cancel and see 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 escassi the cnel in this the vocation 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.970
 d 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.790
 exchange a little and arrive after a side of the sea 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.579
 i 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.869
 Well, what I wanted 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.610
 the mind as it has is known my work I'm a little 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.100
 tactically 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.560
 all our one percent work focused from one point of view 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 the idea is that the point of view is that in principle 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.000
 min 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.660
 everyone knows that we think that architecture is silent 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.729
 Not at the beginning 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.940
 it's like the world the world does not talk about not just that richard rorty 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.080
 in his book huge contingent solidarity people talk about 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.680
 that the world does not speak what is needed 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.420
 build a language program to be able 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.310
 to extract some word from the world, I do not believe that this happens to initiate virtue of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.990
 that the smuda creature 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.270
 It's mute and it's like a black box. 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.180
 I think 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.080
 the for many people on the street the creature is something incomprehensible 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.940
 also for many times for many of his classmates 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.909
 the time the work a lot of buying buy does not come back 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.790
 in common it brought incompressible like a black box that we are not capable we are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.619
 how to understand the result 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.789
 but not what is the mechanism not 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.770
 I have felt very interested and they are 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.979
 percent 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.799
 talk about what I would like 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.829
 is to speak precisely of what said percent 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:25.880
 he did not have it 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.320
 that you have to open the black boxes not that the obligation of science in 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.260
 this case the praiseworthy in which tura 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.379
 that of the black boxes of life teach the mechanisms 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.599
 with which attack of tura although sometimes it may seem absurd to suppose that 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.169
 may seem incomprehensible but at least 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.039
 but on that occasion to participate or to involve society in the 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.079
 direct jobs and some processes 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.230
 intellectuals 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.600
 and materials and resource management that makes architecture 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.159
 the respect returning a bit what from the beginning the dryness of the p 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.029
 of the condition world of architecture the position of the program 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:02.819
 language 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.919
 for 100 being with richard rorty he says one thing they are of interest before 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.720
 the construction of the language program 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600
 by knowledge occurs 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.800
 from the creation of a private lexicon 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.859
 insists that this private lexicon 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.819
 almost restitution of old words is produced from the 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.409
 private obsessions 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.240
 my idea 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.720
 is to explain a bit the obsessions that the DNA is office photos of the two 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.919
 private sessions of that office that in the background catalyze a public work 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.959
 that they repeat themselves in what 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.139
 percent the success let's say of the thought I say success to the 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.299
 director is produced 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.249
 when the confrontation between private associations and the needs 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:38.899
 public 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.999
 coincident is to say I'm not saying that there's 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.130
 percent 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.900
 build only one projection mechanism 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 of the obsessions plan about reality and it's not being aware that when by 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.110
 coincidental end that's a mistake but the other way round in two rounds committed that 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.420
 the high because it has to do with projection system my name is 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.349
 thinking of ideas from each multiple reality what in the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.750
 background position build that with the conditions of variable limits 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.560
 builds in open systems and that are produced as company sections 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.369
 projection the reality 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:17.209
 so I in the two subjects of the carers fundamentally 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.529
 percent and that are tovar catalysts that of all the offices are 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.689
 of equality and diversity and of the per 100 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.879
 the one of the DNA 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:27.819
 ubilla 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.539
 no footprint in the vision 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.779
 is that they are let's say two fields of work in which we are stuck in the office 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.249
 and that we are interested in not equality and diversity in funds the framework 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:37.720
 let's say about democracy 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.050
 gives us all democrat decided to roast in equality diversity because all 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.270
 we are the same and different, but this seems to us 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.009
 architecture is tremendously architectural 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.080
 has a lot to do with this when you have the mystic in the mosque 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.810
 córdoba contos capitals equal and vente counted the equal spaces and 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.600
 different percent is a little what was happening eye that kind of 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.090
 Spain exports annually in the orphanage 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.010
 or the real city 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.349
 the constituent venice le corbusier not 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.599
 those pieces that works from equality and church elements and 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.360
 the systems 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.270
 of repetition
