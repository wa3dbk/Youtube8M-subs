appropriate cutouts and everything lines
up<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.459> fine<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.799> then<00:02:25.799> when<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.610> want<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
up just fine and then when you want to

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.520 
up just fine and then when you want to
use<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.150> stand<00:02:27.480> position<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.200> undo<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
use the stand position you undo that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.199 
use the stand position you undo that
bungee<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.280> again<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.640> doesn't<00:02:29.939> use<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
bungee and again it doesn't use the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.929 
bungee and again it doesn't use the
sleep/wake<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.250> you're<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> basically

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
sleep/wake but you're going to basically

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.910 
sleep/wake but you're going to basically
pull<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.810> out<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.379> can<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.769> that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
pull this out and you can see that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.979 
pull this out and you can see that
you've<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.069> notches<00:02:35.819> here<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.659> this<00:02:36.810> is

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
you've got notches here that this is

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.080 
you've got notches here that this is
just<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.379> sit<00:02:37.680> into<00:02:37.950> its<00:02:38.430> appropriate

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
just going to sit into its appropriate

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140 
just going to sit into its appropriate
position<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:40.950> nice<00:02:41.189> in<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.670> regard

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
position and so it's nice in that regard

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.680 
position and so it's nice in that regard
it<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.870> very<00:02:43.260> light<00:02:43.530> case<00:02:44.269> what<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.390> doesn't

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it is a very light case what it doesn't

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.229 
it is a very light case what it doesn't
do<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.069> leave<00:02:47.310> some<00:02:47.670> area<00:02:48.060> of

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
do is it is going to leave some area of

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.569 
do is it is going to leave some area of
your<00:02:48.359> iPad<00:02:48.720> exposed<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> back<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.489> you

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
your iPad exposed on the back and you

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.670 
your iPad exposed on the back and you
can<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.150> there<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.230> may<00:02:52.379> be<00:02:52.440> of

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
can see that there so that may be of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.250 
can see that there so that may be of
some<00:02:53.190> concern<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.000> some<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.780> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
some concern for some of you and you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.619 
some concern for some of you and you
could<00:02:55.409> of<00:02:55.530> course<00:02:55.560> fold<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.519> back<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.299> book

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
could of course fold it back like a book

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.199 
could of course fold it back like a book
as<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.530> use<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:59.069> way

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
as well and use it that way

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.300 
as well and use it that way
overall<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:01.049> really<00:03:01.109> not<00:03:01.769> impressed<00:03:02.220> with

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
overall I'm really not impressed with

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.319 
overall I'm really not impressed with
this<00:03:02.549> case<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.739> $39.99<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.950> too<00:03:05.250> much<00:03:05.459> if

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
this case I think $39.99 is too much if

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.910 
this case I think $39.99 is too much if
you<00:03:06.599> are<00:03:06.780> interested<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.859> would

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you are interested in this I would

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.410 
you are interested in this I would
encourage<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.549> search<00:03:08.819> around<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.239> see

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
encourage you to search around and see

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.000 
encourage you to search around and see
if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.599> can<00:03:09.780> pick<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.379> cheaper<00:03:10.799> price

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
if you can pick it up at a cheaper price

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.190 
if you can pick it up at a cheaper price
just<00:03:11.790> seems<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.209> there's<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> lot<00:03:12.900> better

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
just seems like there's a lot better

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.160 
just seems like there's a lot better
choices<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.950> market<00:03:14.310> today<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.510> there's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
choices on the market today and there's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.990 
choices on the market today and there's
some<00:03:16.379> potential<00:03:16.739> quality<00:03:17.069> issues<00:03:17.609> with<00:03:17.819> this

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
some potential quality issues with this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
some potential quality issues with this
I<00:03:18.239> will<00:03:18.629> also<00:03:18.660> mention<00:03:19.139> on<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> red<00:03:19.799> one<00:03:20.069> I

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
I will also mention on the red one I

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.159 
I will also mention on the red one I
don't<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.419> can<00:03:21.540> catch<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.019> the

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
don't know if you can catch it in the

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.020 
don't know if you can catch it in the
camera<00:03:22.410> but<00:03:23.129> it<00:03:23.669> does<00:03:23.879> pick<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:25.940> don't<00:03:26.940> know

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
camera but it does pick up I don't know

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
camera but it does pick up I don't know
if<00:03:27.150> any<00:03:27.299> other<00:03:27.510> way<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> say<00:03:27.959> it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
if any other way to say it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.849 
if any other way to say it
dust<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.519> dirt<00:03:29.819> relatively<00:03:30.720> easy<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:31.829> I

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
dust and dirt relatively easy so when I

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.189 
dust and dirt relatively easy so when I
look<00:03:32.159> at<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.489> red<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.359> already<00:03:33.569> see<00:03:33.900> you

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
look at the red I can already see you

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.979 
look at the red I can already see you
know<00:03:34.409> black<00:03:34.709> marks<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:36.239> was<00:03:36.540> straight

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
know black marks and that was straight

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.839 
know black marks and that was straight
out<00:03:37.169> of<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.409> store<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.400> came<00:03:38.579> like<00:03:38.819> that

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
out of the store that it came like that

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.780 
out of the store that it came like that
so<00:03:39.480> that's<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.949> know<00:03:40.980> something<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.579> you

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
so that's you know something that you

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.159 
so that's you know something that you
might<00:03:41.909> have<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> deal<00:03:42.389> with<00:03:42.419> this<00:03:42.720> case<00:03:42.989> as

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
might have to deal with this case as

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.170 
might have to deal with this case as
well<00:03:43.379> spec<00:03:44.040> generally<00:03:44.579> makes<00:03:44.760> really<00:03:45.000> good

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
well spec generally makes really good
