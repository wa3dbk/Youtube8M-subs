00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 beaver dear friends we waited waited 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.080
 and finally came the song 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.900
 folders nights at freddys 3 and damn it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.019
 I just adore her especially this one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.019
 part 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.560
 just drop dead drop but we're not here on 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.060
 music came to talk about reveal all 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.520
 secrets of that song 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.920
 I'll tell you this story from mini-games 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.720
 killing a purple guy we see how 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.150
 he comes to animatronics sees that 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.070
 animatronic moves and therefore runs away 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.630
 because he does n't have any weapons right now 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.520
 came just to check whether the live 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.140
 animatronics and here they are Tina 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.710
 really alive he ran for 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.420
 an ax 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.950
 Freddie woke up at that moment and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.660
 set off to travel around 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.070
 the restaurant is interesting by the way 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.350
 detail here we do not see at all 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.969
 Violet Freddy apparently living group 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.230
 tombstone thinks purple is fredy 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.420
 it is nothing more than personally and for 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 animatronic hallucinations if you want 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.600
 write in the comments I more 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.609
 I will explain about what I do not mean so or 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.500
 otherwise animatronics came into motion a 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.780
 this is exactly what purple needed 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.519
 the guy to solve them one by one but this one 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 interesting moment I do not really understand what 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.750
 he means he hits the wall with a hammer down 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.640
 three theories of any man's cosplay neighbor 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.890
 who constantly knocks on the wall reptile 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 or it attracts animatronics or else 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.760
 he is trying to open the secret room 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.320
 springtrap room 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.910
 but this is unlikely because it is unlikely 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.830
 he hid the room when he went 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.480
 Freddie, because breaking the room was wrong 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.190
 just it can be seen from the sparks which 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 fly off at blows if it were 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.090
 something fragile then the wall would immediately 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.250
 about breaking and spark means that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.900
 something hard to break through which means with 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.210
 so feeble little. I would have to 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.740
 spend a few hours I doubt 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.480
 what in a few hours walking by 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.280
 the restaurant Freddie would not have found him 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.960
 but assuming he breaks the room 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 already after cracking down on 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.900
 animatronics then it is not firstly 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.550
 matches the mini game 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.990
 and secondly it does not coincide with the logic 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.180
 because otherwise he would take a sledgehammer 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.950
 more so its cool to hell 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 punch this wall really this 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.800
 unlikely option 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.450
 and here he is the moment purple guy 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.720
 attack freddie just look 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.940
 on the face can be seen that Freddy is afraid of direct 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.800
 I feel sorry for him at this moment I think 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.170
 what's the kid who is freddie 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.330
 I recognized my killer and so he 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 scared it is also confirmed by the words 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 this is not the first time you die 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.840
 also your mechanical parts sound 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.269
 as well as the bones that I broke ask 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.819
 pay attention that broke in the past 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.890
 time, that is, it has happened that 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.990
 not exactly appeal kWh kind moments with 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 springtrapom him one in the bone did not break 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.680
 sounds cruel i know but it becomes 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.709
 obviously 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.689
 the whole song is sung on behalf of the killer and for sure 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.909
 not on the face of a puppet because a puppet 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.040
 I wouldn't talk to animatronics like that 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.290
 essentially her children that is from the face 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.689
 purple guy that's why freddie 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.849
 so scared he doesn't want to worry about it 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.430
 again but the killer asks no one and 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.409
 freddie word poor thing by the way here 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.200
 explained how the hat appeared on the site 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.269
 scott freddie beat and cougar hat fell on 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.189
 the same place as the site even the floor 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.840
 same way when on show 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.400
 carnage can be assumed that traces 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.010
 who are on the floor 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.930
 these are traces of purple Freddy I will not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.599
 This is to refute though personally I think that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.669
 This is from the love of the usual Freddie Sr. 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.079
 the same hall and could easily leave these 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.599
 traces but here I assert nothing 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.669
 I admit both options even when the rabbit 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.719
 goes the floor for a moment turns into 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.030
 full blood 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.129
 perhaps it is here that it is 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.299
 the place children were killed therefore 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.489
 symbolizes blood 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.230
 about this and symbolize traces because we 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.389
 remember that the killer was then in costume 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.889
 it may be a memory of a child 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.389
 who was in the bath 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.909
 now move on to another interesting 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:32.169
 moment of the wall read upwards this 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.449
 end don't lie it's not you i left no truth 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.120
 another wall is the end we donâ€™t 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.040
 hopeless this end know the wall has 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.250
 the second option is a big inscription 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.859
 no nevrii supposedly this is not the end there 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.689
 moan also believe that fnaf 3 is not yet 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.819
 see the end purple guy 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.319
 waiting for its new prey by the way 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.569
 saying the fact that he is waiting for them 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.669
 proves he is innocent and would start 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.519
 just left here right after 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.079
 defused 1 Freddy and if he is good yes 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.879
 he has no reason to kill all these 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.620
 animatronic features in fnaf vadim and from 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.209
 They hid hid and then they both 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.919
 game catches here we see everything 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.629
 animatronics go to him but there is one 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.060
 interesting twist the following frames he 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.099
 breaks animatronics one by one he breaks 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.959
 their long enough it means that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.819
 in spite of the fact that in that frame it is visible 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.039
 it was that animatronics go to him a crowd 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.239
 he managed them you c spit and break by 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.979
 debt but one by one 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.479
 what the hell is the thoughtful type of angle 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.120
 now go to another interesting 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.490
 things when animatronics die and when 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.979
 showing the souls of children seen over them 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.260
 that animatronics seems to be really 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.449
 the opinion of the authors of the song fnaf 3 occurs 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.240
 before fnaf2 see panic yourself 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.710
 faces of a check with a broken jaw if 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.719
 so then it's very cool because 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.900
 very long ago gave a theory about it on 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.729
 people then told me and wrong think 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.860
 is it just a coincidence is it real 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.629
 hint if you want i will tell that my 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.370
 a theory that was once not accepted 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.930
 I hope for an answer in the comments and of time 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.839
 we started talking about checks when her head 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.629
 flies off her eyes are very similar to the eyes 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:00.580
 phantom interesting if further truth 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.339
 already rewind we see as souls 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.110
 children are released from costumes and then 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.800
 at the very end they go to the purple 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.599
 a guy 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.310
 an interesting difference is nâ€™t many knowing 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.039
 you have noticed but here everything happens 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.469
 right before leaving the unopened room a 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.020
 just before going out there is still light 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.060
 one chip children 4 they 5 here two 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.789
 options either golden freddie like me and 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.039
 wondered not released either we all 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.319
 see through the eyes of golden Freddy so 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.999
 as if he, too, was freed, and 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.529
 when children finally coming to 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.379
 purple guys appear on 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.969
 instant image springtrap 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.580
 true i was hoping that springtrap 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.669
 much more will be so cool 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.439
 noclip and without it came out awesome here 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.300
 and all dear friends I told you everything 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.560
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.560
 bye bye bye good luck
