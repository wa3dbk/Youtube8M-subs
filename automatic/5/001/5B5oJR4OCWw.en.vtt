00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
hi there we're going to do a rhythm

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:33.049 
hi there we're going to do a rhythm
today<00:00:13.120> in<00:00:13.510> the<00:00:13.599> style<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.019> John<00:00:14.320> Lee<00:00:14.500> Hooker

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.790 

now<00:00:34.059> this<00:00:34.239> is<00:00:34.390> in<00:00:34.510> regular<00:00:35.079> or<00:00:35.200> standard

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
now this is in regular or standard

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.799 
now this is in regular or standard
tuning<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.730> way<00:00:36.969> I'm<00:00:37.149> doing<00:00:37.510> this<00:00:37.630> is

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
tuning and the way I'm doing this is

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.350 
tuning and the way I'm doing this is
like<00:00:38.020> this<00:00:38.260> we're<00:00:38.469> in<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.649> key<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.270> we

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
like this we're in the key of a and we

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.389 
like this we're in the key of a and we
place<00:00:40.600> an<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.870> called<00:00:41.170> on<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.440> guitar<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.340> we

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
place an a called on the guitar and we

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.020 
place an a called on the guitar and we
do<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.940> by<00:00:43.120> placing<00:00:43.390> our<00:00:43.720> first<00:00:44.170> finger<00:00:44.560> tip

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
do that by placing our first finger tip

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.020 
do that by placing our first finger tip
over<00:00:46.030> strings<00:00:46.420> four<00:00:47.380> three<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:47.800> two<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.670> fret

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
over strings four three and two of fret

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.850 
over strings four three and two of fret
so<00:00:49.360> it's<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.600> formal<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.020> chord<00:00:52.380> don't<00:00:53.380> worry<00:00:53.680> if

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
so it's a formal a chord don't worry if

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.560 
so it's a formal a chord don't worry if
it's<00:00:54.010> over<00:00:54.310> string<00:00:54.610> one<00:00:54.910> as<00:00:55.090> well<00:00:55.300> we're<00:00:55.480> not

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
it's over string one as well we're not

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.830 
it's over string one as well we're not
going<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.900> playing<00:00:56.140> string<00:00:56.650> one

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
going to be playing string one

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.890 
going to be playing string one
and<00:00:59.710> this<00:00:59.860> is<00:00:59.980> how<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.130> start<00:01:00.490> the<00:01:00.550> rhythm<00:01:03.900> we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
and this is how we start the rhythm we

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.240 
and this is how we start the rhythm we
pick<00:01:05.200> string<00:01:05.590> three<00:01:06.040> with<00:01:06.220> an<00:01:06.310> upstroke<00:01:06.820> oh

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pick string three with an upstroke oh

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.190 
pick string three with an upstroke oh
and<00:01:09.250> then<00:01:09.760> pick<00:01:10.060> string<00:01:10.450> five<00:01:10.840> with<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
and then pick string five with the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then pick string five with the
downstroke<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:16.000> without<00:01:16.240> pick<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:16.810> do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
downstroke then without pick we do

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.760 
downstroke then without pick we do
upstrokes

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
upstrokes

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.790 
upstrokes
on<00:01:17.890> strings<00:01:18.400> three<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:18.940> four<00:01:22.440> four<00:01:23.440> off<00:01:23.620> them

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
on strings three and four four off them

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.930 
on strings three and four four off them
one<00:01:23.950> after<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.280> other<00:01:24.400> like<00:01:24.730> that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
one after the other like that

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:36.390 
one after the other like that
so<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.390> slow<00:01:25.690> motion<00:01:34.650> no<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:35.800> between<00:01:35.920> those

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
so in slow motion no in between those

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400 
so in slow motion no in between those
four<00:01:36.430> up<00:01:36.880> strokes<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.720> music<00:01:38.170> down

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
four up strokes you can do a music down

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.090 
four up strokes you can do a music down
stroke<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:39.100> your<00:01:39.130> fists<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.580> this<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.920> you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
stroke with your fists like this if you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.630 
stroke with your fists like this if you
just<00:01:42.970> hit<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.330> guitar<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.110> then<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.460> get

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
just hit the guitar and then you get

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
just hit the guitar and then you get
that<00:01:51.759> percussive<00:01:52.330> effect<00:01:59.820> having<00:02:00.820> done<00:02:01.000> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that percussive effect having done that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.340 
that percussive effect having done that
aim<00:02:03.250> for<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.729> inside<00:02:04.210> strings<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.960> strings

aim for the inside strings that strings

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.630 
aim for the inside strings that strings
two<00:02:05.770> three<00:02:06.250> four<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> five<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.149> go<00:02:08.490> with<00:02:09.490> your
