that<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.440> quickly<00:00:04.799> brushed<00:00:05.160> over<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.700> video

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
that I quickly brushed over in my video

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.970 
that I quickly brushed over in my video
about<00:00:06.060> solo<00:00:06.420> queue<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.830> take

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
about solo queue and that is to take

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950 
about solo queue and that is to take
each<00:00:08.250> game<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> time<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.660> one<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
each game at a time and it's one of the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.959 
each game at a time and it's one of the
biggest<00:00:10.290> tips<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.650> give<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.309> avoid<00:00:11.519> losing

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
biggest tips I can give to avoid losing

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940 
biggest tips I can give to avoid losing
streaks<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.870> an<00:00:13.019> interesting<00:00:13.230> concept<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
streaks it's an interesting concept that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.070 
streaks it's an interesting concept that
many<00:00:14.219> players<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.089> trouble<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.570> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
many players do have trouble with so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
many players do have trouble with so
let's<00:00:16.260> get<00:00:16.379> started<00:00:17.029> now<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> need<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
let's get started now what you need to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
let's get started now what you need to
do<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> comes<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.470> leak<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.039> take

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
do when it comes to leak is to take

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.640 
do when it comes to leak is to take
every<00:00:20.550> single<00:00:20.850> game<00:00:20.970> at<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> time<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> was

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
every single game at a time as if it was

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.040 
every single game at a time as if it was
on<00:00:22.800> its<00:00:22.980> own<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.090> many<00:00:24.300> players<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:24.930> their

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
on its own so many players look at their

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
on its own so many players look at their
entire<00:00:25.380> session<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.920> playing<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
entire session of playing and this is a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
entire session of playing and this is a
major<00:00:27.269> thing<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.840> cause<00:00:28.019> losing

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
major thing that can cause losing

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.950 
major thing that can cause losing
streaks<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.490> actuality<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.570> play<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
streaks but in actuality that play is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.680 
streaks but in actuality that play is
almost<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> self-fulfilling<00:00:31.949> prophecy

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy
they're<00:00:33.690> mad<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.530> losing<00:00:34.680> but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
they're mad because they're losing but

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
they're mad because they're losing but
they're<00:00:35.790> losing<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.660> they're<00:00:36.870> mad<00:00:37.110> by

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
they're losing because they're mad by

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
they're losing because they're mad by
breaking<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> cycle<00:00:38.820> by<00:00:38.910> becoming

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
breaking the cycle by becoming

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
breaking the cycle by becoming
self-aware<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> huge<00:00:41.010> step

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
self-aware and you can take a huge step

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
self-aware and you can take a huge step
forward<00:00:41.460> into<00:00:42.030> avoiding<00:00:42.420> losing<00:00:42.750> streaks<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
forward into avoiding losing streaks and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
forward into avoiding losing streaks and
all<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.100> takes<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.610> little<00:00:44.969> understanding

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
all this takes is a little understanding

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
all this takes is a little understanding
you<00:00:46.469> need<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> understand<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> every<00:00:47.850> game

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you need to understand that every game

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569 
you need to understand that every game
is<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> new<00:00:48.629> beginning<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> new<00:00:49.200> start<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
is a new beginning a new start and is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
is a new beginning a new start and is
completely<00:00:51.000> unaffected<00:00:51.390> by<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.050> previous

completely unaffected by your previous

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
completely unaffected by your previous
games<00:00:52.710> unless<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.610> let<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
games unless you let it just because you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.139 
games unless you let it just because you
had<00:00:55.440> teammates<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> fed<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:56.699> single<00:00:56.969> Lane

last game doesn't mean they'll feed this

analogy<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:05.970> liken<00:01:06.360> League<00:01:06.540> games<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
analogy let's liken League games to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
analogy let's liken League games to
flipping<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> coin<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.610> flipped<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.939> once

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
flipping a coin if you flipped at once

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
flipping a coin if you flipped at once
you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> 50%<00:01:10.320> chance<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> being<00:01:10.920> heads

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you have a 50% chance of it being heads

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.270 
you have a 50% chance of it being heads
if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.909> flip<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.180> again<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.560> 50%

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
if you flip it again there's still a 50%

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
if you flip it again there's still a 50%
chance<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> being<00:01:14.970> heads<00:01:15.409> that's<00:01:16.409> just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
chance of it being heads that's just

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.530 
chance of it being heads that's just
standard<00:01:16.830> probability<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.060> accept

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
standard probability it's how we accept

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
standard probability it's how we accept
coin<00:01:18.900> flips<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.430> about<00:01:20.549> getting<00:01:20.909> two

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
coin flips but how about getting two

coin flips but how about getting two
heads<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> row<00:01:21.720> well<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> chance<00:01:22.799> of

heads in a row well that chance of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
heads in a row well that chance of
course<00:01:23.159> lowers<00:01:23.549> down<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> 25%<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> thing

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
course lowers down to 25% but the thing

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.270 
course lowers down to 25% but the thing
is<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> 25%<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.590> only<00:01:28.799> lower<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
is is that that 25% is only lower to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700 
is is that that 25% is only lower to
that<00:01:29.400> once<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.000> look<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.540> both<00:01:30.869> coin<00:01:31.290> flips

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that once we look at both coin flips

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
that once we look at both coin flips
together<00:01:32.159> when<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.150> part<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> 50%

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
together when they are part it's a 50%

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
together when they are part it's a 50%
chance<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.549> when<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:35.790> together

it's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.420> 25%<00:01:37.259> chance<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> need

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's a 25% chance this is how you need

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
it's a 25% chance this is how you need
to<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.479> games<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.840> League<00:01:40.280> although

this<00:01:41.460> analogy<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> weird<00:01:42.450> because

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this analogy is kind of weird because

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
this analogy is kind of weird because
it's<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.960> likely<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> 50%

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it's not likely for you to have a 50%

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's not likely for you to have a 50%
win<00:01:44.549> rate<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.600> likely<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
win rate and it is more likely to be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.280 
win rate and it is more likely to be
around<00:01:46.409> 55<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.220> 60%<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.750> fact<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
around 55 to 60% or so the fact is that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
around 55 to 60% or so the fact is that
the<00:01:49.409> chance<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.890> winning<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.310> games<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the chance of you winning two games is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
the chance of you winning two games is
pretty<00:01:50.939> much<00:01:51.090> half<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> winning<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
pretty much half of that winning just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
pretty much half of that winning just
one<00:01:52.380> game<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.399> only<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.970> low<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.720> we

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
one game but it's only that low when we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.410 
one game but it's only that low when we
look<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.229> both<00:01:55.290> games<00:01:55.950> together<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.270> look

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
look at both games together if you look

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.600 
look at both games together if you look
at<00:01:57.540> each<00:01:57.689> game<00:01:57.899> individually<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:59.040> potential

at each game individually your potential
win<00:01:59.790> chance<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.630> higher<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
win chance is much higher this is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
win chance is much higher this is
