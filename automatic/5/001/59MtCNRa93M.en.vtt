00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
different pieces of VirtualBox and a lot

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
different pieces of VirtualBox and a lot
of<00:03:16.099> these<00:03:16.190> are<00:03:16.370> network<00:03:16.790> connections<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
of these are network connections and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.229 
of these are network connections and
this<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> give

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
this is so you have to give

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.930 
this is so you have to give
administrative<00:03:21.459> permission<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:22.609> this<00:03:22.790> is

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
administrative permission so this is

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.460 
administrative permission so this is

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.249 
could you put your virtual machines
where<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.449> want<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:54.080> may<00:05:54.229> not

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
where you want to you may not

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.300 
where you want to you may not
necessarily<00:05:54.590> want<00:05:55.100> them<00:05:55.430> public<00:05:56.800> but<00:05:57.800> I<00:05:58.009> like

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
necessarily want them public but I like

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.920 
necessarily want them public but I like
to<00:05:58.460> control<00:05:58.789> exactly<00:05:59.180> where<00:05:59.570> they're<00:05:59.720> going

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
to control exactly where they're going

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.680 
to control exactly where they're going
and<00:06:00.169> I<00:06:00.289> make<00:06:00.740> a<00:06:00.770> separate<00:06:01.280> folder<00:06:02.120> for<00:06:02.509> the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
and I make a separate folder for the

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.900 
and I make a separate folder for the
virtual<00:06:03.350> machines<00:06:03.740> as<00:06:04.009> opposed<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.580> just

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
virtual machines as opposed to just

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.290 
virtual machines as opposed to just
putting<00:06:05.680> them<00:06:06.680> willy-nilly<00:06:06.889> here<00:06:07.789> in<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.090> in

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
putting them willy-nilly here in the in

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.230 
putting them willy-nilly here in the in
the<00:06:08.509> user<00:06:08.720> directory<00:06:09.289> it's<00:06:09.949> like<00:06:10.070> okay<00:06:10.520> here

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
the user directory it's like okay here

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.230 
the user directory it's like okay here
that<00:06:11.660> is<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.260> click<00:06:13.130> OK<00:06:13.520> again<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:14.060> then

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
that is and click OK again and then

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.060 
that is and click OK again and then
you're<00:06:14.449> ready<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:15.110> go<00:06:15.350> and<00:06:15.560> create<00:06:15.770> your

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
you're ready to just go and create your

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.020 
you're ready to just go and create your
own<00:06:16.270> new<00:06:17.270> virtual<00:06:17.600> machine<00:06:18.550> as<00:06:19.550> long<00:06:19.789> as<00:06:19.910> you

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
own new virtual machine as long as you

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.090 
own new virtual machine as long as you
have<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.360> operating<00:06:20.930> system<00:06:21.320> if<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.710> windows

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
have the operating system if the windows

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.050 
have the operating system if the windows
you<00:06:22.250> need<00:06:22.400> you<00:06:22.729> need<00:06:22.940> your<00:06:23.120> license<00:06:23.780> and

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
you need you need your license and

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.710 
you need you need your license and
that's<00:06:26.060> pretty<00:06:26.210> much<00:06:26.360> it<00:06:26.620> thank<00:06:27.620> you
