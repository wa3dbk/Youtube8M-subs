any external software you can do it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.920 
any external software you can do it
within<00:00:16.619> windows<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:18.050> in<00:00:19.050> order<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.830> that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
within windows and in order to do that

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.339 
within windows and in order to do that
open<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.580> start<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> are<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.939> 7<00:00:26.939> or

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
open up the start if you are in 7 or

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.359 
open up the start if you are in 7 or
vista<00:00:28.349> or<00:00:29.160> eight<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.859> if<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.009> begin<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
vista or eight and then if you begin to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520 
vista or eight and then if you begin to
type<00:00:32.579> firewall<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.750> should<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
type firewall you should have the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.119 
type firewall you should have the
Windows<00:00:35.100> Firewall<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.760> advanced<00:00:36.300> security

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
Windows Firewall with advanced security

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.569 
Windows Firewall with advanced security
option<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:40.219> when<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> available

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
option and then when that is available

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
option and then when that is available
in<00:00:43.550> outbound<00:00:44.550> rules<00:00:45.140> outbound<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> inbound

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
in outbound rules outbound and inbound

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.630 
in outbound rules outbound and inbound
rules<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:48.180> you'll<00:00:48.329> need<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> change

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
rules are what you'll need to change

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.380 
rules are what you'll need to change
outbound<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.510> means<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> software<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
outbound just means that the software is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
outbound just means that the software is
sending<00:00:55.020> data<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.309> inbound<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.770> send

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
sending data out and inbound in send

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.389 
sending data out and inbound in send
again<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.550> simple<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:01.010> then<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.129> rules

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
again pretty simple so then these rules

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.260 
again pretty simple so then these rules
create<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> new<00:01:03.180> rule<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.220> make<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.580> program

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
create a new rule and make it a program

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.490 
create a new rule and make it a program
rule<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> program<00:01:09.240> path<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
rule and then for the program path you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.880 
rule and then for the program path you
would<00:01:10.710> browse<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.960> whatever<00:01:12.960> program<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
would browse for whatever program you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
would browse for whatever program you
want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:15.320> isolate<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:18.259> say<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:21.619> my

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
want to isolate so say I want is my

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.999 
want to isolate so say I want is my
dolphin<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:24.270> emulator<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.530> contact<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
dolphin we emulator not to contact the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.359 
dolphin we emulator not to contact the
internet<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.540> add<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
internet so I would add that to this and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.240 
internet so I would add that to this and
then<00:01:29.790> next<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.900> block<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> connection

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
then next I would block the connection

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.719 
then next I would block the connection
and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:33.470> with<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.560> block<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:35.430> everything

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and then with a block to have everything

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.319 
and then with a block to have everything
selected<00:01:36.210> by<00:01:37.020> default<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
selected by default and then would be I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
selected by default and then would be I
don't<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:42.560> dolphin<00:01:43.560> has<00:01:43.770> no<00:01:43.979> friends

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
don't know dolphin has no friends

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
don't know dolphin has no friends
doesn't<00:01:45.090> need<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> contact<00:01:45.600> anyone<00:01:45.869> anyway<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
doesn't need to contact anyone anyway so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.969 
doesn't need to contact anyone anyway so
if<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> finish<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.880> rule

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
if I finish then that is now a rule

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.149 
if I finish then that is now a rule
delfin<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.310> friends<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:55.259> cannot<00:01:55.890> make

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
delfin has no friends and it cannot make

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.770 
delfin has no friends and it cannot make
outbound<00:01:56.430> connections<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.990> any<00:01:58.380> servers<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
outbound connections to any servers and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
outbound connections to any servers and
you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> same<00:02:01.469> thing<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.729> inbound

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you can do the same thing with inbound

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can do the same thing with inbound
and<00:02:05.659> dolphin<00:02:07.369> see<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:09.060> block<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> connection

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and dolphin see I block the connection

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040 
and dolphin see I block the connection
and<00:02:10.679> then

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.009 
and then
Dalton<00:02:14.310> will<00:02:15.310> never<00:02:15.519> make<00:02:15.940> friends<00:02:16.209> because

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
Dalton will never make friends because

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.290 
Dalton will never make friends because
now<00:02:17.170> no<00:02:17.349> one<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.530> talk<00:02:17.860> no<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.610> contact

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.380 
now no one can talk no one can contact
the<00:02:19.480> dolphin<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.700> have<00:02:21.910> successfully

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the dolphin and now we have successfully

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.920 
the dolphin and now we have successfully
isolated<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.379> dolphin<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.720> dolphin<00:02:25.720> will

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
isolated the dolphin and dolphin will

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
isolated the dolphin and dolphin will
never<00:02:26.500> socialize<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.489> anyone<00:02:27.970> else<00:02:28.239> so
