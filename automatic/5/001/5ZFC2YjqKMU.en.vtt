00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.300 
got padded straps so that's good the key
that<00:01:35.320> we<00:01:35.439> want<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.679> stress<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.130> how

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
that we want to stress here is how

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.010 
that we want to stress here is how
quickly<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.939> can<00:01:37.000> set<00:01:37.299> this<00:01:37.450> up<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.780> take<00:01:37.960> it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
quickly you can set this up and take it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.630 
quickly you can set this up and take it
down<00:01:38.170> we're<00:01:38.829> going<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.039> kind<00:01:39.219> of<00:01:39.249> do<00:01:39.369> this<00:01:39.490> in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
down we're going to kind of do this in

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.950 
down we're going to kind of do this in
reverse<00:01:39.939> order<00:01:40.119> we're<00:01:40.359> going<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.539> show<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.719> us

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
reverse order we're going to show you us

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.289 
reverse order we're going to show you us
taking<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.499> down<00:01:41.710> then<00:01:42.189> setting<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:42.729> up<00:01:42.820> in<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
taking it down then setting it up in the

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.880 
taking it down then setting it up in the
video<00:01:43.539> we're<00:01:43.719> going<00:01:43.840> step-by-step<00:01:44.679> and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
video we're going step-by-step and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.770 
video we're going step-by-step and
explaining<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.579> all<00:01:45.729> but<00:01:46.179> really<00:01:46.329> when<00:01:46.630> you're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
explaining it all but really when you're

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.239 
explaining it all but really when you're
doing<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.289> not<00:01:47.409> talking<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.009> kind<00:01:48.159> of

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
doing it and not talking and kind of

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.489 
doing it and not talking and kind of
combining<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.729> steps<00:01:48.999> took<00:01:49.509> us<00:01:49.659> about<00:01:49.899> 60

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
combining the steps took us about 60

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:51.840 
combining the steps took us about 60
seconds<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.100> take<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.399> whole<00:01:51.520> thing<00:01:51.729> apart

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
seconds to take the whole thing apart

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.300 
seconds to take the whole thing apart
another<00:01:52.719> 60<00:01:53.200> seconds<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.619> put<00:01:53.859> back<00:01:54.100> together

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
another 60 seconds to put back together

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.639 
another 60 seconds to put back together
so<00:01:54.909> we<00:01:54.999> think<00:01:55.179> that's<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.539> key<00:01:55.840> real<00:01:56.259> simple

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
so we think that's the key real simple

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.410 
so we think that's the key real simple
no<00:01:56.799> tools<00:01:57.189> needed<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.700> put<00:01:57.969> this<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.270> together

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
no tools needed to put this in together

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.599 
no tools needed to put this in together
or<00:01:58.899> take<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.289> apart<00:01:59.560> let's<00:01:59.859> take<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.159> look<00:02:00.399> all

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
or take it apart let's take a look all

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.639 
or take it apart let's take a look all
right<00:02:01.119> let's<00:02:01.270> show<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.719> how<00:02:01.899> you<00:02:01.960> take<00:02:02.259> apart

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
right let's show you how you take apart

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.639 
right let's show you how you take apart
this<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:03.189> hybrid<00:02:03.789> by<00:02:04.119> quick<00:02:04.450> shape<00:02:04.749> it's

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
this go hybrid by quick shape it's

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.709 
this go hybrid by quick shape it's
actually<00:02:06.039> much<00:02:06.219> faster<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.119> take<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.389> apart<00:02:07.600> if

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
actually much faster to take it apart if

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.270 
actually much faster to take it apart if
you're<00:02:07.840> not<00:02:07.960> talking<00:02:08.380> try<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.679> explain<00:02:09.100> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
you're not talking try to explain it

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.770 
you're not talking try to explain it
while<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> might<00:02:09.880> do<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.060> little<00:02:10.149> bit<00:02:10.330> slow<00:02:10.569> here

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
while I might do a little bit slow here

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.410 
while I might do a little bit slow here
just<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.080> show<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.530> step<00:02:12.190> one<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.270> take

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
just to show so step one is just to take

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.480 
just to show so step one is just to take
these<00:02:13.600> legs<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.290> push<00:02:14.740> them<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.250> there's<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
these legs and push them in so there's a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.430 
these legs and push them in so there's a
little<00:02:15.640> button<00:02:15.970> right<00:02:16.240> here<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:17.230> press

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
little button right here you just press

little button right here you just press
that<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.700> goes<00:02:18.909> in<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.299> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> legs

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that that goes in one of the legs

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.790 
that that goes in one of the legs
top<00:02:20.440> telescope<00:02:21.099> telescopes<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.239> well

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
top telescope telescopes in as well

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.809 
top telescope telescopes in as well
alright<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:23.860> we've<00:02:24.069> got<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.400> I'm<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:24.790> to

go over and do all four legs just like

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.250 
go over and do all four legs just like
that<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.159> our<00:02:27.310> first<00:02:27.519> step

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that that's our first step

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.780 
that that's our first step
alright<00:02:29.260> we've<00:02:29.440> got<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:29.799> four<00:02:30.099> legs<00:02:30.370> folded

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
alright we've got all four legs folded

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.820 
alright we've got all four legs folded
up<00:02:30.940> as<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.269> see<00:02:31.390> it's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.569> very<00:02:31.599> short<00:02:31.870> tent<00:02:32.650> now

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
then the next step is just to remove

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.670 
then the next step is just to remove
this<00:02:34.900> canopy

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
this canopy

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.259 
this canopy
there's<00:02:35.799> just<00:02:36.010> velcro<00:02:36.489> which<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.790> attaching

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
there's just velcro which is attaching

there's just velcro which is attaching
it<00:02:37.390> take<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.230> off<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.590> all<00:02:38.709> four<00:02:38.950> corners

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
it take this off on all four corners

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:52.770 
it take this off on all four corners
we're<00:02:39.879> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> fold<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.420> up

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.120 

all<00:02:53.780> right<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.050> next<00:02:54.260> step<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.710> there<00:02:55.070> are

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
all right so next step is there are

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.460 
all right so next step is there are
these<00:02:55.250> four<00:02:55.580> pull<00:02:56.030> pins<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.720> all<00:02:56.930> four<00:02:57.170> corners

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
these four pull pins on all four corners

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
these four pull pins on all four corners
you're<00:02:57.710> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> pull<00:02:58.310> them<00:02:58.430> out<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:58.730> your

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you're going to pull them out with your

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.760 
you're going to pull them out with your
hand<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.240> just<00:02:59.810> kind<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.140> release<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
hand and just kind of release the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.230 
hand and just kind of release the
tension<00:03:01.220> here<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:01.790> we're<00:03:01.880> going<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
tension here so we're going to do that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.480 
tension here so we're going to do that
in<00:03:02.360> all<00:03:02.510> four<00:03:02.810> corners<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.860> pull<00:03:04.130> out<00:03:04.160> these

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
in all four corners just pull out these

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.100 
in all four corners just pull out these
pull<00:03:04.790> pins<00:03:05.060> that's<00:03:05.600> going<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.840> allow<00:03:05.930> us<00:03:05.960> to

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
pull pins that's going to allow us to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.410 
pull pins that's going to allow us to
collapse<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
collapse it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.610 
collapse it
alright<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.570> four<00:03:08.810> pull<00:03:09.080> pins<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:09.590> been

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
alright the four pull pins have been

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.070 
alright the four pull pins have been
pull<00:03:09.980> attention<00:03:10.130> released<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.450> final<00:03:11.720> step

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
pull attention released the final step

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.810

how to set up real quick all right step

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.400 
how to set up real quick all right step
one<00:04:10.460> is<00:04:10.820> just<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> pull<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.450> opposite<00:04:12.020> corners

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
one is just to pull the opposite corners

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.040 
one is just to pull the opposite corners
and<00:04:12.620> let's<00:04:13.130> let<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.790> expand<00:04:14.330> out<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.930> can

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
and let's let this expand out so you can

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.760 
and let's let this expand out so you can
go<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.820> it's<00:04:17.780> about<00:04:17.930> six<00:04:18.290> feet<00:04:18.530> so

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
go like this and it's about six feet so

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.960 
go like this and it's about six feet so
I'll<00:04:18.830> take<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.040> little<00:04:19.220> bit<00:04:19.340> just<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.609> pull<00:04:19.850> it

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
I'll take a little bit just to pull it

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.460 
I'll take a little bit just to pull it
all<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.120> way<00:04:20.239> out<00:04:20.330> but<00:04:21.080> again<00:04:21.290> you're<00:04:21.440> just

going<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.770> work<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.070> opposite<00:04:22.490> corners<00:04:22.910> until

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
going to work the opposite corners until

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:34.380 
going to work the opposite corners until
this<00:04:23.330> frame<00:04:23.570> comes<00:04:23.900> out<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.760> way<00:04:25.880> here

important<00:05:55.150> for<00:05:55.270> me<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.510> couple<00:05:56.020> of<00:05:56.080> things<00:05:56.260> are

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
these stakes so if you if it's really

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.180 
these stakes so if you if it's really
windy<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:58.870> can<00:05:59.140> stake<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.590> in<00:05:59.770> at<00:05:59.920> the<00:06:00.040> bottom

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
