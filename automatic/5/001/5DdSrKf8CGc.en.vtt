hello<00:00:01.770> everybody<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.510> to

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hello everybody this video is going to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.499 
hello everybody this video is going to
be<00:00:04.220> dedicated<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.670> how<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> made<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
be dedicated to how I made a

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.879 
be dedicated to how I made a
do-it-yourself<00:00:07.500> reactor<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.450> use

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
do-it-yourself reactor you can use

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.410 
do-it-yourself reactor you can use
pretty<00:00:10.889> much<00:00:11.040> anything

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
pretty much anything

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.930 
pretty much anything
maybe<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:12.960> bio<00:00:13.110> pellets<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.880> definitely<00:00:14.880> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
maybe not bio pellets but definitely you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.420 
maybe not bio pellets but definitely you
could<00:00:15.059> use<00:00:15.210> carbon<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.780> GFO<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.379> use<00:00:17.130> just

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
could use carbon and GFO I use just

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.000 
could use carbon and GFO I use just
carbon<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> bought<00:00:20.150> bulk<00:00:21.150> resupply

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
carbon in it but I bought bulk resupply

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.019 
carbon in it but I bought bulk resupply
reactor<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> end<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.670> you're<00:00:23.820> really

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
reactor in the end but if you're really

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
reactor in the end but if you're really
tight<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.269> money<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.990> could<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.130> answer

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
tight on money this could be the answer

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.419 
tight on money this could be the answer
to<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.990> using<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.260> carbon<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.220> really

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to you using some carbon but you really

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
to you using some carbon but you really
don't<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.750> end<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.140> throwing

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
don't want to do is just end up throwing

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
don't want to do is just end up throwing
like<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> bag<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> carbon<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> end<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.059> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
like a bag of carbon in the end like in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
like a bag of carbon in the end like in
the<00:00:33.300> bottom<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.690> sump<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.920> main

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the bottom of your sump or in your main

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
the bottom of your sump or in your main
display<00:00:35.579> tank<00:00:35.660> or<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:36.930> seen<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.530> just

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
display tank or it's not seen and just

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
display tank or it's not seen and just
really<00:00:38.100> doesn't<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.760> anything<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.360> need

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
really doesn't do anything you need

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.400 
really doesn't do anything you need
water<00:00:40.379> flowing<00:00:40.770> over<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
water flowing over for it actually to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.369 
water flowing over for it actually to
work<00:00:43.670> GFO<00:00:44.670> tends<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.840> tumble<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
work GFO tends to like to tumble and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.130 
work GFO tends to like to tumble and
have<00:00:46.680> higher<00:00:47.059> gallons<00:00:48.059> per<00:00:48.239> hours<00:00:48.539> whereas

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
have higher gallons per hours whereas

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
have higher gallons per hours whereas
carbon<00:00:49.980> likes<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:51.829> slow<00:00:52.829> contact<00:00:53.370> times

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
carbon likes to have slow contact times

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.920 
carbon likes to have slow contact times
and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.229 
and
he<00:00:56.930> rather<00:00:57.199> slow<00:00:58.039> down<00:00:58.219> per<00:00:58.520> hour<00:00:58.640> through<00:00:59.090> it

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
he rather slow down per hour through it

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
he rather slow down per hour through it
so<00:01:00.170> last<00:01:00.920> couple<00:01:01.250> things<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.489> keep<00:01:01.579> in<00:01:01.699> mind<00:01:01.850> if

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
so last couple things to keep in mind if

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.340 
so last couple things to keep in mind if
you're<00:01:02.149> gonna<00:01:02.239> run<00:01:02.420> both<00:01:02.660> in<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:02.989> same<00:01:03.170> thing

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
you're gonna run both in the same thing

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.680 
you're gonna run both in the same thing
you<00:01:04.070> don't<00:01:04.250> want<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.519> tumbling<00:01:04.909> because<00:01:05.570> if

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
you don't want it tumbling because if

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.649 
you don't want it tumbling because if
you<00:01:05.780> have<00:01:05.900> both<00:01:06.140> tumbling<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.369> GFO<00:01:08.150> tends<00:01:08.450> to

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
you have both tumbling the GFO tends to

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.740 
you have both tumbling the GFO tends to
be<00:01:08.780> stronger<00:01:09.590> than<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.729> carbon<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.600> was

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
be stronger than the carbon and it was

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.510 
be stronger than the carbon and it was
crying<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.140> down<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.530> find<00:01:12.649> a<00:01:12.830> end<00:01:13.100> up<00:01:13.220> having

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
crying it down you find a end up having

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.100 
crying it down you find a end up having
sounds<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.180> little<00:01:14.270> like<00:01:14.450> carbon<00:01:14.899> dust

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
sounds a little like carbon dust

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.040 
sounds a little like carbon dust
particles<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:15.920> your<00:01:16.070> tank<00:01:16.729> which<00:01:17.050> would

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
particles in your tank which would

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.550 
particles in your tank which would
probably<00:01:18.290> not<00:01:18.500> be<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> best<00:01:18.950> with<00:01:19.310> tanks<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
probably not be the best with tanks so

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.380 
probably not be the best with tanks so
that's<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.710> thing<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.920> keep<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.070> mind<00:01:22.360> how<00:01:23.360> I

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's one thing to keep in mind how I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.399 
that's one thing to keep in mind how I
actually<00:01:23.540> built<00:01:23.840> it

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
actually built it

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.279 
actually built it
I<00:01:24.549> used<00:01:27.039> right<00:01:28.039> here<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.259> like<00:01:30.259> a

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
I used right here this is a like a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.770 
I used right here this is a like a
filter<00:01:30.740> for<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:30.979> marina<00:01:31.310> filter<00:01:31.729> fresh<00:01:32.539> water

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
filter for a marina filter fresh water

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.039 
filter for a marina filter fresh water
filter

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
filter

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.099 
filter
there's<00:01:35.859> s15<00:01:36.460> filter<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.509> can<00:01:37.600> use<00:01:37.659> anything

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
there's s15 filter you can use anything

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.690 
there's s15 filter you can use anything
you<00:01:38.289> can<00:01:38.619> even<00:01:38.829> use<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.100> power<00:01:39.280> head<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:39.609> you

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
you can even use a power head if you

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.669 
you can even use a power head if you
want

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
want

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.100 
want
not<00:01:41.679> Power<00:01:41.920> had<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.100> mean<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.789> real<00:01:43.060> pump

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
not Power had I mean like a real pump

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.060 
not Power had I mean like a real pump
I<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:45.890> had<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.820> because<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.920> first<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.980> all<00:01:49.040> I

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
I just had this because I first of all I

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.220 
I just had this because I first of all I
think<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.250> don't<00:01:49.340> use<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:50.480> right<00:01:50.660> here<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.900> just

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
think I don't use it's right here I just

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.270 
think I don't use it's right here I just
really<00:01:51.710> good<00:01:51.920> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
really good it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.810 
really good it
I<00:01:52.310> think<00:01:52.970> preferably<00:01:53.650> would<00:01:54.650> be<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:54.950> use<00:01:55.130> hot

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
I think preferably would be to use hot

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.250 
I think preferably would be to use hot
glue<00:01:55.850> or<00:01:56.330> super<00:01:56.780> glue<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:57.670> used<00:01:58.930> airline<00:01:59.930> cubing

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
glue or super glue I used airline cubing

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.630 
glue or super glue I used airline cubing
not<00:02:00.410> really<00:02:00.620> airline<00:02:00.920> tubing<00:02:01.040> actually<00:02:01.520> it's

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
not really airline tubing actually it's

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.310 
not really airline tubing actually it's
actually<00:02:02.270> meant<00:02:02.360> for<00:02:02.480> water<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:04.540> load<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.780> if

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
actually meant for water and load it if

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.770 
actually meant for water and load it if
this<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.680> uh<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.520> Titanic<00:02:08.119> canister

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
this is uh this is Titanic canister

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.810 
this is uh this is Titanic canister
that's<00:02:09.650> right<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.980> can<00:02:10.310> probably<00:02:10.490> use<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's right you can probably use the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.790 
that's right you can probably use the
Gatorade<00:02:11.180> bottle<00:02:11.480> some<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.780> back<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.200> I

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
Gatorade bottle some of the back and I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.660 
Gatorade bottle some of the back and I
just<00:02:12.830> glued<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.400> into<00:02:13.610> here<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:15.310> water<00:02:16.310> travels

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
just glued it into here to water travels

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.930 
just glued it into here to water travels
right<00:02:16.790> here<00:02:17.030> got<00:02:17.570> here<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:19.310> uh

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
right here got here your uh

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.510 
right here got here your uh
carbon<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.870> jfo<00:02:22.260> whatever<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.100> want<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
carbon and jfo whatever you want and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.820 
carbon and jfo whatever you want and
usually<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> year<00:02:25.710> but

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
usually I don't have it in the year but

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.230 
usually I don't have it in the year but
right<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.430> cut<00:02:26.940> out<00:02:27.090> basically

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
right now but you just cut out basically

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.490 
right now but you just cut out basically
what's<00:02:30.240> called<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.740> sponge<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.780> specific

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
what's called a sponge to this specific

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.720 
what's called a sponge to this specific
diameter<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.520> big<00:02:35.700> enough

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
diameter just want to get a big enough

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
diameter just want to get a big enough
one<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.360> maybe<00:02:36.510> filter<00:02:36.900> Foss<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:37.920> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
one or maybe filter Foss just so it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280 
one or maybe filter Foss just so it
doesn't<00:02:38.070> tumble<00:02:38.610> around<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.420> are<00:02:39.720> if

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
doesn't tumble around if you are if

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.570 
doesn't tumble around if you are if
you're<00:02:40.440> using<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.740> more<00:02:40.890> powerful<00:02:41.070> pump<00:02:41.430> I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
you're using a more powerful pump I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.820 
you're using a more powerful pump I
didn't<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.150> problem<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.200> weak<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
didn't have that problem is so weak that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.040 
didn't have that problem is so weak that
pump<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.550> not<00:02:44.670> strong<00:02:44.910> at<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.960> don't

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
pump it's not strong at all so I don't

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.800 
pump it's not strong at all so I don't
have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.290> pump<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.570> gonna<00:02:48.660> have

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
have the pump but if you're gonna have

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.309 
have the pump but if you're gonna have
that<00:02:48.930> problem<00:02:49.050> you're<00:02:49.320> gonna<00:02:49.380> let<00:02:49.590> me<00:02:49.740> get

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
that problem you're gonna let me get

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.509 
that problem you're gonna let me get
from<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.400> glued<00:02:52.819> another<00:02:54.189> tubing<00:02:55.189> piece

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
from there I glued another tubing piece

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.569 
from there I glued another tubing piece
on<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.269> top<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.650> way<00:02:57.860> were<00:02:58.129> just

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
on to the top all the way were just

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.000 
on to the top all the way were just
returns<00:02:59.060> into<00:02:59.360> my<00:02:59.480> tank<00:02:59.720> you<00:03:00.650> can't<00:03:00.829> really

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
returns into my tank you can't really

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.550 
returns into my tank you can't really
run<00:03:01.159> this<00:03:01.280> outside<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.939> sump<00:03:02.209> because<00:03:03.019> it'll

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
run this outside of a sump because it'll

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.280 
run this outside of a sump because it'll
probably<00:03:03.829> end<00:03:04.220> up<00:03:04.280> leaking<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.290> that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
probably end up leaking and and that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.020 
probably end up leaking and and that
would<00:03:06.379> not<00:03:06.500> be<00:03:06.590> good<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.129> run<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.549> inside<00:03:07.730> your

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
would not be good so run it inside your

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.119 
would not be good so run it inside your
sump<00:03:09.970> yeah<00:03:10.970> let's<00:03:11.239> pretty<00:03:11.420> much<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:12.129> thanks

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
sump yeah let's pretty much it thanks

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.610 
sump yeah let's pretty much it thanks
for<00:03:13.280> watching
