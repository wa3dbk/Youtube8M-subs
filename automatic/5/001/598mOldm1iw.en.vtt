 with us fourth goal there 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.769
 goal had to today good match face to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 Sochaux 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.819
 yeah good match of the whole team 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.340
 after his departure it is especially hard to 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.480
 mark but the important thing is that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.110
 the team does a good game it's this 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.569
 we did I thought pretty well so 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.040
 a good day in the world 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.830
 condrieu you are happy at all 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.480
 especially better at home it gives 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.010
 something you but of course it's 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 always a great pleasure to receive 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.049
 edouard here in the middle of his family well 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.400
 because they were widely 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.340
 represented today on the stadium 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.430
 it is a great pleasure before but 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.829
 the result is fair of city two 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 goals of the fingers to the siren congratulate 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:53.319
 edouard but you must not have created 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.319
 thank you 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.050
 that's what we say it's rather a 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.200
 good today 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.590
 yeah that's right it was a good one 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.820
 match 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.130
 the heat would not be obvious 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.200
 physically the teams working 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.090
 so that from the beginning we made a big 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.190
 week is good to find the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.040
 main risk it was very close 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.200
 but now we had English hearts 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.870
 catch up with last emmy result 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.340
 draw or Meneghin it's a shame 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.630
 that we took this second bus to bayaa 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.350
 not buy everything and that's encouraging 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.020
 for the future 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.310
 it's very personal a car and a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.840
 team maybe from the warm up 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.030
 sacred little something 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.910
 that's always fun at g konÃ© 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.260
 and until the departure of the group will be done 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.790
 and so it's nice to play against 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.220
 them but yeah we'll see it's in the 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.320
 next weeks safra championship or 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.590
 not with a launch story will 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.550
 piloted what does it do to you all this not 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.370
 especially after it's always 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.350
 delicate do not know in this 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.640
 championship will start your problems 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.750
 years old now techno league 2 on 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.750
 will start against orleans and 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.480
 the organization you have good weather there 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.640
 had four goals 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.680
 yes it was a beautiful football party 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.790
 we will say with two beautiful teams have 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.720
 played the game and then in addition to them 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.370
 viewers could see a little bit of 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.710
 show so it's very good 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.050
 everyone leaves happy he goes on 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.850
 wish good even dijon and sochaux 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.100
 for next season maybe a 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.870
 third is the second time that this 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.000
 match proves that there certainly was 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.130
 infrastructure that gives pleasure 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.270
 one or two weeks yes yes maybe 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.870
 third I do not know if there will be a 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.330
 third time 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.580
 Sochaux I 'm not sure at all 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.750
 since it's been twice so I think 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 turn to the level of the free county 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.590
 on clubs wait and jean-louis this 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.480
 they will come back next year it's 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.220
 almost sure since we will sign a 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.610
 partnership with them in the days to 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.770
 come 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.740
 we will get closer to them so we have to 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:53.390
 a friendly match every year china g 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.410
 of fourth season oil at levi 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.460
 season is the lively recovery of 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.180
 Monday training for all 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.930
 senior 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.040
 yes, we will continue to progress 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.050
 was a fair bit last year for 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.370
 stay in dh and on cydia 1 because 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.380
 it's not all going to dh and has 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.030
 broken nose as they say you have to be 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.520
 solid foundation 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.160
 so we structure ourselves little by little and 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.440
 so that in two to three years bah 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.790
 we will access the level dh 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.130
 it's true that we recruited 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.200
 a little bit wisely with players 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.729
 little experienced all that to frame 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.520
 our young players but we did not do 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.100
 anything either we do not have no 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.750
 more recruit 20 players we have five 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.390
 recluse at present there will 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.040
 maybe one who will arrive in the 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.080
 next few days but will not 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.040
 of revolution 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.930
 thank you 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.060
 many layers 2 franck olive 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.590
 dussopt multimedia about the match we are 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.690
 state of mind I will say that 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.670
 it's his hand but overall it was 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.470
 quite satisfying on a lot of 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.780
 things to fix but is what was 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.790
 interesting especially is to be able to 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.260
 to come back to the mark by being led is 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.620
 able to go scores a second goal 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.090
 also early in the second half 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.550
 I think we should have kept this 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.470
 result is not getting in trouble 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.900
 but as you emphasize it I think 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.810
 that the state of mind 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.040
 was very interesting in term 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.070
 aggressiveness but also in term 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.590
 technical and tactical because 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.540
 since beginning of the recovery I think that 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.130
 it's a game you have to 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.900
 to rely on it now 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.610
 on the screen sports museums museum 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.840
 comfortable situation not leave 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.050
 necessarily that every day that 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.540
 I hear in your really it's not 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.250
 simply 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.150
 able to adapt despite everything 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.160
 true we would like the situation 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.220
 are much clearer now the 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.560
 instances does not allow it to be it goes 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.190
 must continue to prepare already 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.300
 and then maybe with a little bit of 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.050
 chance we'll have maybe a week of 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.810
 more to prepare 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.660
 if it does not matter we will have to fix it 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:53.930
 on our goals citadium to fight 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.930
 for to for the ascent we have them
