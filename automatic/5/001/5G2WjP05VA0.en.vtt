00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
which we had from the start we were very

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.900 
which we had from the start we were very
fortunate<00:04:11.620> because<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.190> my<00:04:12.370> history<00:04:12.549> in<00:04:12.820> the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
fortunate because of my history in the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.349 
fortunate because of my history in the
industry<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:15.010> was<00:04:15.190> something<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.090> didn't<00:04:16.330> think

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
industry it was something I didn't think

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.570 
industry it was something I didn't think
that<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:16.810> would<00:04:16.930> fail<00:04:17.140> at<00:04:17.380> but<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.769> think<00:04:17.859> that's

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
that we would fail at but I think that's

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.620 
that we would fail at but I think that's
probably<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.060> problem<00:04:19.419> with<00:04:19.540> most

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
probably the problem with most

probably the problem with most
entrepreneurs<00:04:20.410> they<00:04:20.620> don't<00:04:20.769> start<00:04:21.040> something

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
entrepreneurs they don't start something

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.610 
entrepreneurs they don't start something
think<00:04:21.549> they're<00:04:21.700> gonna<00:04:21.820> fail<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.470> could

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
think they're gonna fail so it could

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.080 
think they're gonna fail so it could
