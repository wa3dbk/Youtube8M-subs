00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hi girls today neither watch is for the return 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 the classes 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 I used the yellow-orange enamel as 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.380
 base with the very thin brush will do 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 stripes with darker orange 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 center of the nail towards the cuticle or 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:36.390
 parallel to the other to clean the balls 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.420
 I used a scraping brush and remover 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 of enamel by always pulling the finger 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 so fill does not erase nail art 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.059
 the pink enamel for him a little English 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.230
 very thick on the tip of the nail 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.100
 we will pass the brush of an enamel 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.050
 metallic gray on one side to the other 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.829
 now the tip of the pencil with the eraser 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 and it's ready 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.510
 I used as a base a translucent enamel 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.260
 with the well pigmented red we will make the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.049
 Apple 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.780
 we will make a half circle on the left side 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.229
 always cleaning from cuticle to tip 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.689
 the nail not to blot and the side 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.619
 right we can one more half circle 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.170
 looks like a heart with enamel 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.070
 brown and a thin brush let's stop the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.590
 Path the same brush in white enamel 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.180
 we will make the apple shine 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.200
 the enamel kiss the leaf on the way 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 to the notebook sheet 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.630
 we will use a pink enamel and a fine brush 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.780
 finite we will draw from the tip of the cuticle 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 up to the tip of the nail 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.610
 now with blue enamel we will make several 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.610
 Parallel attractions suffer horizontally 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.020
 in the rain of notebook sheets 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.870
 is ready 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 I used the translucent enamel as a base in 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.230
 a lounge to make the piece of wood 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.840
 side the first enamel near the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.260
 cuticle to the tip and then below 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.420
 plus the enamel brush on both sides 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 near the cuticle forms a triangle and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.870
 at the tip of the nail it's all filled 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.840
 with a fine brush and black enamel 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 we will make the pencil point in the shape of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:33.020
 triangle with yellow-orange enamel 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 we will make the cable as soon as I find it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.800
 eraser 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.180
 we will make orange marks on the tip of the pencil 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.940
 also in the face thumb amid 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 m100 plaque Konad all colorful

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.700
 finish with extra brightness and tournament 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.120
 china is ready to rock on the back 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.120
