00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
then screw it in and not have to figure

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.100 
then screw it in and not have to figure
out<00:01:15.259> how<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.560> attach<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.899> what<00:01:17.899> I'm<00:01:18.020> gonna

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
out how to attach it so what I'm gonna

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.270 
out how to attach it so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:19.159> mount<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.670> on<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.479> wall<00:01:20.509> up<00:01:20.929> there<00:01:21.280> on

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
do is mount it on the wall up there on

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.020 
do is mount it on the wall up there on
its<00:01:22.759> side<00:01:23.060> instead<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.840> mounted<00:01:24.319> like<00:01:24.470> this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
its side instead of mounted like this

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.190 
its side instead of mounted like this
it's<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.270> be<00:01:26.390> mounted<00:01:26.750> like<00:01:26.899> this

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's going to be mounted like this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.700 
it's going to be mounted like this
against<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.770> wall<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:29.330> then<00:01:29.929> hopefully<00:01:30.530> run

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
against the wall and then hopefully run

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.059 
against the wall and then hopefully run
right<00:01:30.979> above<00:01:31.250> ooh<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:32.509> know<00:01:32.630> what

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
right above ooh you know what

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:39.999 
right above ooh you know what
but<00:01:34.069> now<00:01:34.220> be<00:01:34.399> enough<00:01:34.610> room<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.600> run<00:01:35.720> above<00:01:39.009> huh

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
but now be enough room to run above huh

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.340 
but now be enough room to run above huh
I'll<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.970> figure<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.360> out<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.569> might<00:01:41.869> not

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
I'll have to figure that out I might not

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.499 
I'll have to figure that out I might not
be<00:01:42.710> able<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:43.009> run<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:46.390> have<00:01:47.390> to

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
be able to run like that I have to

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.359 
be able to run like that I have to
figure<00:01:47.719> that<00:01:47.810> out<00:01:47.869> off<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.009> see<00:01:49.159> what<00:01:49.189> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
figure that out off to see what the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.700 
figure that out off to see what the
distance<00:01:49.729> between<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:51.350> is

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
distance between this and this is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.109 
distance between this and this is
actually<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.310> looks<00:01:52.490> like<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.729> might<00:01:52.850> have<00:01:53.030> it

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
actually it looks like I might have it

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.539 
actually it looks like I might have it
off<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:53.540> run<00:01:54.469> over<00:01:54.680> there

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
off so run over there

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.359 
off so run over there
run<00:01:55.729> over<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.000> there<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.799> second

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
run over to there and then that second

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.520 
run over to there and then that second
drum<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:58.969> have<00:01:59.210> installed<00:01:59.539> I'm<00:02:00.170> gonna<00:02:00.380> put

installed<00:02:23.829> hopefully<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:25.579> works<00:02:25.730> well

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
installed hopefully that works well

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.849 
installed hopefully that works well
nothing<00:02:26.989> else<00:02:27.079> I<00:02:27.260> was<00:02:27.350> thinking<00:02:27.410> does<00:02:27.739> that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
nothing else I was thinking does that

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.319 
nothing else I was thinking does that
want<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.100> release<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.579> little<00:02:28.820> bit<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.120> tension

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
want to release a little bit of tension

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.900 
want to release a little bit of tension
on<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.560> springs<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:31.850> more

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
on the springs so that there's more

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.770 
on the springs so that there's more
weight<00:02:32.299> on<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.570> door<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.340> door<00:02:34.780> can

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
weight on the door so that the door can

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.990 
weight on the door so that the door can
pull<00:02:36.549> itself<00:02:37.549> down<00:02:38.000> right<00:02:38.329> now<00:02:38.480> D<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.700> think<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
pull itself down right now D I think the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.490 
pull itself down right now D I think the
door<00:02:41.209> would<00:02:41.390> stay<00:02:41.660> put<00:02:41.959> even<00:02:42.260> though<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
door would stay put even though the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.890 
door would stay put even though the
opener<00:02:42.829> was<00:02:43.010> telling<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> go<00:02:44.209> down

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
opener was telling it to go down

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.259 
opener was telling it to go down
it<00:02:45.140> won't<00:02:45.319> wait<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.769> but<00:02:45.950> I'm<00:02:46.909> not<00:02:46.970> even

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
it won't wait on that but I'm not even

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.580 
it won't wait on that but I'm not even

I want to test this thing to see if it

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.059 
I want to test this thing to see if it
works

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
works

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.559

but<00:03:10.700> before<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> do<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:12.640> want<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.730> secure<00:03:14.209> it

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
but before I do that I want to secure it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.460 
but before I do that I want to secure it
a<00:03:14.840> little<00:03:15.319> bit<00:03:15.500> better<00:03:15.760> up<00:03:16.760> here<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:18.200> garage

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
a little bit better up here the garage

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.149 
a little bit better up here the garage
door<00:03:18.769> opener<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.909> also<00:03:20.359> want<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:21.099> release<00:03:24.159> some

door opener I also want to release some

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.680 
door opener I also want to release some
tension<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.579> those<00:03:25.790> Springs<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.359> the<00:03:26.480> door<00:03:26.659> is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
tension on those Springs so the door is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.619 
tension on those Springs so the door is
actually<00:03:27.409> heavier<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:28.519> way<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.909> keeps<00:03:29.269> that

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
actually heavier that way it keeps that

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:56.580 
actually heavier that way it keeps that
cable<00:03:30.139> that<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.349> wound<00:03:30.650> around<00:03:31.069> they're<00:03:31.489> tight

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.379 

clamps<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.669> ran<00:03:58.879> it<00:03:59.000> through<00:03:59.090> that

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
clamps and then I ran it through that

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.089 
clamps and then I ran it through that
thing<00:03:59.810> with<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.799> pin<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:01.750> with<00:04:02.750> any<00:04:02.900> luck<00:04:03.099> this

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
thing with a pin and with any luck this

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.830 
thing with a pin and with any luck this
thing<00:04:04.430> should<00:04:05.139> drag<00:04:06.139> its<00:04:06.349> way<00:04:07.120> down<00:04:08.120> there<00:04:08.419> and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
thing should drag its way down there and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.729 
thing should drag its way down there and

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
I can test to see whether this together

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.279 
I can test to see whether this together
okay

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
okay

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.100 
okay
there<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:47.020> okay<00:04:48.020> there<00:04:48.409> it<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:49.870> installed

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
there it is okay there it is installed

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.040 
there it is okay there it is installed
I<00:04:51.260> tested<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.880> pulled<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.300> door<00:04:53.510> off<00:04:53.750> and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
I tested it it pulled the door off and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.610 
I tested it it pulled the door off and
shut<00:04:54.229> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
shut the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
shut the
-<00:04:56.080> one<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.290> problems<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:58.100> found<00:04:58.430> is

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
- one of the problems that I found is

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.450 
- one of the problems that I found is
that<00:04:58.900> because<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.170> relying<00:05:00.830> on<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.130> cable

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
that because this is relying on a cable

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.100 
that because this is relying on a cable
being<00:05:01.940> taught<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:04.370> door<00:05:04.550> are<00:05:04.670> stuck<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.330> then

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
being taught the door are stuck and then

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.270 
being taught the door are stuck and then
the<00:05:06.170> whole<00:05:06.260> cable<00:05:06.560> thing<00:05:06.890> just<00:05:07.130> went<00:05:07.340> haywire

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
the whole cable thing just went haywire

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.230 
the whole cable thing just went haywire
I<00:05:10.280> don't<00:05:10.580> like<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.120> much<00:05:11.920> so<00:05:12.920> I<00:05:13.460> don't

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
I don't like that so much so I don't

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.560 
I don't like that so much so I don't
know<00:05:14.450> what<00:05:14.630> I'm<00:05:14.690> gonna<00:05:14.780> do<00:05:14.990> about<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.490> mmm

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
know what I'm gonna do about that so mmm

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.060
