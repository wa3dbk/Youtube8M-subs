 hello to everyone of you will and then he us 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 on channel 10,000 subscribers just 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 unimaginable number 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.340
 wanted to thank everyone for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 what you subscribe for what you 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.859
 singled out 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.740
 channel and decided that he is worthy to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 his sign that there is something there 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 useful and pleasant thank you so much 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.160
 for likes for comments are not very good 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 criticism is also useful thanks to her we 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 getting better and fixing some 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 mistakes or omissions honestly admit 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 when I created the channel 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.800
 about more than a little more than a year where 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 I didn't even think about what 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 someday he will sign up so much 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 lierse people talk stacked i 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:10.460
 I thought that the average daddy would be 1000 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 or 3000 but no more to prove and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.020
 by the way I can answer one question 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 which has recently become quite 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.630
 often ask why and why i 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.259
 created a channel and that me on it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.020
 spodviglo but one of the reasons the fact has become 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.180
 to interest in games and you need to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 it was somehow his 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 resumes and so far I have climbed y 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.560
 tuba it is six months before the creation of the channel I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 stumbled naturally on whom I could 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 still stumble as not on arthur ear and you 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.070
 you know when I started watching him 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 drop down first rollers 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 first video I liked it so much 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.229
 it sounded like it all looked like it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.140
 it was all so harmonious comments and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 here is the game itself and everything seems to be right there 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 so it should be I decided to try and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 I then looked for other male channels 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.259
 channel and female food so find so for 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.679
 comparisons to see how at all 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.409
 it all looks from the female side 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.069
 and this then creates a channel and where 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:18.670
 tupanul in october yes help you i 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.620
 became a channel and a month and a half later 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.510
 all the time I was searching for information 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.950
 how to record how to mount and here 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.230
 when all this I found everything and color and all 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.159
 I got all this information from me 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.269
 All our tried it turned out on December 7 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.370
 I think the first video came out is the first 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.169
 passing call of duty 2 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.500
 why not to the club of nine women 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:51.769
 1 unfortunately could not do it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.230
 write fraps when recording 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.840
 I was very slow with the fraps 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.030
 I have a video game bandicam 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.599
 knocked out the game so I am long for a long time 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.689
 tormented 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.819
 came to the conclusion that fix the bottom of this first 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.939
 you go start with the second 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.419
 and it seems to me that I will do right what 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:17.870
 I am evil precisely call of duty 2 because I 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:21.919
 so thought know first time 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.720
 worth taking the game you know and in 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:29.000
 which you feel comfortable with me 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.919
 it seems I am not mistaken the most important 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.470
 minus at the very beginning it certainly is with me 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.299
 bad microphone but this is all nonsense 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.069
 all fixable correctable 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.739
 and the second reason i created 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.519
 the channel is the interest when I found all 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.549
 these are all these channels with n sprays 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.370
 interest to try out the most or 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.970
 It does not work well, they all say that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.989
 it seems like it happened and it turns out 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.579
 I hope that in the future will also 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.579
 everything will turn out that everything will be fine 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.810
 I want to say it again 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.060
