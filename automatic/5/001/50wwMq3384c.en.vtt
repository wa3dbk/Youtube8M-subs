00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.309
 hello guys this is interactive medicine 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.200
 and today we will talk about meiosis or 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.200
 sexual cell division 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.120
 to better understand meiosis or 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 sexual cell division we must think 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.950
 at birth when we are born we have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.440
 characteristics of our parents and 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.800
 mothers for example the hair of your 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.090
 father and your mother's eyes this wants 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.650
 say that at some point the material 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.439
 our genetic parents should 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.630
 have been combined to form us the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.510
 father grants a sperm or 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.510
 male gamete and the mother grants a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.880
 ovule or female gamete both the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 sperm and the egg with a load 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.010
 individual genetics of 23 chromosomes of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 way that when the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.379
 fertilization and the sperm joins and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 the ovum will add the 23 chromosomes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.370
 paternal with the maternal to form 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.710
 a cell with a genetic load of 46 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.230
 chromosomes this cell of 46 chromosomes 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 now formed will be in the future then 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.610
 divide into a million times a being 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 human in that way we define meiosis 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.330
 as a process of cell division that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 allows the obtaining of gametes 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.650
 female or male that is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 spermatozoon 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 now well where meiosis occurs 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.710
 Meiosis occurs in cells 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 germinal that in man 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.600
 found in the testicles and in the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 woman in the ovaries now well to 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 difference from mitosis where it 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 obtained two diploid daughter cells 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.820
 from a cell division the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 meiosis comprises two divisions 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.160
 successive known as meiosis 1 and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.740
 means and s 2 the first half division 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.580
 is a reduction division to the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.250
 of a 2n diploid stem cell with 46 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.050
 chromosomes you get two daughter cells 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 a floyd is that is n with 23 chromosomes 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.850
 the second half division or meiosis 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.369
 2 is characterized by double the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.320
 number of cells plus the load does not change 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.070
 chromosomes as in the middle stage tica 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.039
 previous 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.290
 meiosis 1 will then be divided into pro 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.410
 phase that in the case of meiosis is 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.740
 will subdivide in turn electrons 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.370
 I follow nema for kinema diploma and day 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 sinesis that will continue then with the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.270
 three classic phases phase anapase and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.270
 tell or phase 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.409
 we will start with the profa se one in a 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.090
 start as in mitosis the 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.730
 genetic material is found 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.159
 disorganized the profa se one 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.959
 characterized by a series of events that 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.019
 they are produced inside the walls 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.420
 nuclear is to say within the core of 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.640
 the cell the first event is the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.250
 condensation of the genetic material that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.220
 will form long filaments inside the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.079
 core this process is known as 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.060
 leptons 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.980
 then the filaments equal or 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.500
 homologous chromosomes that have that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 name because they are identical in size and 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.400
 characteristics begin to approach 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 each other that is to say they mate and the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.040
 result of that mating is known 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.069
 as bivalent or tetrad 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.140
 this process is known as I follow nema to 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.840
 then the homologous chromosomes 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.670
 mates exchange genetic material 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.609
 in the process of cross-linking or 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.099
 crossing over this process is known 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.829
 as an inem pack to the chromosomes 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.109
 homologues continue to condense up 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.720
 that you can observe the chromatic 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.140
 thus obtaining its well-known form of 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.900
 x 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.480
 However, when chromatic 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.120
 we will clearly see the places 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 where the material has been exchanged 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.580
 genetic and to these exchange sites 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.150
 we will call you 'the most this process 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.490
 it is known as diploma and finally the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.850
 nuclear membrane disappears and the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.770
 chromosomes are dispersed in the cytoplasm 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.530
 this last stage of the profa is one 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.300
 will know as sinesis day like 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.760
 in mitosis for the culminating of the prov 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.160
 so there will be no nuclear membrane and the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.410
 center will have migrated to the poles 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.140
 Cells unfolding the myth spindles 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.250
 In this way culminates the profa 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.680
 1 and the goal starts phase 1 the goal 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.870
 Phase 1 has the same characteristics 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.790
 that the meta mitotic phase chromosomes 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.710
 they are arranged at the equator of the cell 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.080
 anchored to mythical spindles by the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.030
 cinema tokoro in the same way this phase 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.980
 will correspond to the stage of the process 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.610
 media where you can observe with 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.250
 greater clarity the chromosomes after 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.800
 the phase goal will occur phase 1 that 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.590
 differs from the mythic phase 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.620
 because in this the chromosome does not 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.900
 will split into its two chromatics hence 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.180
 the genetic load will be divided to the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.729
 half and it does not stay as in the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.069
 mitosis is at this moment in which the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.580
 genetic load at a start of 46 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:05.040
 chromosomes is reduced to 23 for each 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.560
 of the next two new cells 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.380
 half of the uncircumcised chromosomes 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.570
 they go to one pole and the other half to 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.000
 another culminating thus the anna phase e 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.960
 beginning the last stage of meiosis 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.840
 1 the phone or phase 1 the phase will be 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.370
 equal to mitosis and two occur 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 primordial events 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.140
 likewise first the reconstitution 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.420
 of the nuclear membrane process that 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.190
 known as cario sinesis and the second 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.320
 will be the elongation and division of 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.380
 cytoplasm in the process known as 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.630
 I quote sinesis in this way culminates the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.610
 profa will one result in two 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.050
 daughter cells with half the load 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.050
 genetics of the stem cell 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.680
 after meiosis 1 will start in 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.170
 each daughter cell meiosis 2 that will be 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.529
 conformed by a teacher , phase 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.719
 phase iii of phase 2 in this case 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:04.689
 however these will be exactly 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.470
 same in process and features to 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.360
 those of mitosis 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.030
 this means that at the end of the 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.370
 means is 2 we will get four cells 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.310
 daughters with a genetic load of 23 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.040
 chromosomes from the previous 2 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.320
 giving a rough total of four 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.960
 daughter cells from just one 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.320
 initial mother cell and culminating the 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.320
 meiosis 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.610
 to better understand the process of 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.860
 meiosis 2 I invite you to check the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.360
 mitosis video because the process 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.360
 it is exactly the same 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.780
 this has been all if you liked it please 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.030
 share it and like this video 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.520
 You can also tell me what you think of it 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.890
 video in the comment box 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.340
 thank you very much for watching and have a 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.340
 cute day
