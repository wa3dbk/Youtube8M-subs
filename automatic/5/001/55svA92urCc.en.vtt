00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
bizarrely you don't see much of a techie

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.289 
bizarrely you don't see much of a techie

movie on them

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.820 
movie on them
something<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.420> well<00:02:15.720> worth<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.230> look

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.050 

there<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> go<00:02:20.069> detail<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> gun<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.910> their

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
there you go detail on the gun and their

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
there you go detail on the gun and their
character<00:02:24.540> their<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.170> cold<00:02:25.470> cast<00:02:25.650> porcelain

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
character their so cold cast porcelain

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.750 
character their so cold cast porcelain
you<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.209> does<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> fairly<00:02:28.250> good<00:02:29.250> job<00:02:29.280> with

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you see it does a fairly good job with

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
you see it does a fairly good job with
the<00:02:29.849> molding<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.569> won't<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.900> quite<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.319> tight

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the molding you won't get quite as tight

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
the molding you won't get quite as tight
as<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.739> might<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.970> mass<00:02:33.180> produced<00:02:33.629> toys

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
as you might on more mass produced toys

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
as you might on more mass produced toys
but<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.349> bear<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.709> mind<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.040> random<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.489> for

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
but if I bear in mind these random a for

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.960 
but if I bear in mind these random a for
a<00:02:35.760> thousand<00:02:36.209> pieces<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:38.129> even<00:02:38.670> still<00:02:38.940> the

a thousand pieces and even still the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.860 
a thousand pieces and even still the
details<00:02:39.390> pretty<00:02:39.690> good<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.620> hard<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.069> be<00:02:41.870> cross

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
details pretty good so hard to be cross

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.550 
details pretty good so hard to be cross
on<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.140> really<00:02:44.540> other<00:02:45.540> nice<00:02:45.720> things<00:02:45.989> about<00:02:46.079> it

with<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:42.470> slight<00:03:43.849> painting<00:03:44.849> overlaps<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.630> just

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
with a slight painting overlaps I just

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.220 
with a slight painting overlaps I just
do<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.290> pretty<00:03:46.530> good<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:48.329> need<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.810> bear

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
do that pretty good just need to bear

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
do that pretty good just need to bear
that<00:03:49.380> in<00:03:49.500> mind<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.859> hand<00:03:50.040> painted<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.609> won't

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that in mind that hand painted you won't

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.659 
that in mind that hand painted you won't
tend<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.359> get<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> same<00:03:52.099> same<00:03:53.099> finishes

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
tend to get the same same finishes

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.309 
tend to get the same same finishes
you'll<00:03:53.790> get<00:03:53.940> from<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> mass-produced<00:03:54.690> pieces

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
you'll get from a mass-produced pieces

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.180 
you'll get from a mass-produced pieces
painted<00:03:56.130> by<00:03:56.250> machines<00:03:57.079> but<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.290> think<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.709> pretty

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
painted by machines but I think a pretty

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.949 
painted by machines but I think a pretty
good<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.760> there<00:03:59.910> you<00:03:59.970> go<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.510> Kashuk

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
good so there you go that is the Kashuk

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.340 
good so there you go that is the Kashuk
trooper<00:04:01.590> from<00:04:01.829> attackers
