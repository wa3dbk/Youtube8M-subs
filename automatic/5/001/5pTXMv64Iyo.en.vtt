00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:18.720
 I would like to open the second chapter of youkai medal today 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:22.109
 It will be the third introduction that we want to open 3 packs this time 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 I wonder if this is the first time I've come out 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:31.970
 I stole the lightning, but I received it from the comment section and I was sorry I did not hear it correctly 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.240
 As the last three rounds of the dark circle last time, the dark circle is already 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.240

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.340

 This is also not glowing 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:08.120

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 Stuck down 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.080
 There is this kind of thing from time to time 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 North 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.130
 There is no excuse 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130

 Assortment taste of handle 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.630
 doing 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.159
 Interesting this sober sober came out 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.159
 Is it normal? 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.539
 Because like a is a nine I'd seen before other squirming not glowing something 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.989
 The last three pack of pies 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.690
 Ah 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 The result of opening three packs this time is 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.130
 Even at $ unreasonable or base Ting of Kimedaru in this Kimedaru that examined this now a little 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.370
 After all 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.760
 But I think that such a change is not a normal without glowing at all unlike costume 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.909
 And it is difficult to understand sleep Kabe 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.540
 If this is below the canal 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.080
 There is a horse below 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.440

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:46.329
 14 types 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:49.780
 I think it is not quite a good pace I aligned, so one key medal is with 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:55.840
 I wonder if I will be follow medal came out three 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:00.540
