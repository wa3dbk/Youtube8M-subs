00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.689
 hector there is a book that is causing 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.120
 furor in the world and a great 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.900
 controversy is titled capital in the 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.190
 21st century is exhausted in amazon from a 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.610
 Professor of School of Economics 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.800
 Paris 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.109
 thomas piketty 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.840
 sometimes on that matter the lord 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.310
 piquet and according to paul krugman Nobel prize 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.779
 of economy in his column of the new york 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.869
 times' is a man who is going to change the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.759
 speech in the world the new york magazine 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 says Mr. Piquet and it's a walk 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.839
 star and with the friendship of an economist 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.350
 as if I was a rock star 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.269
 martÃ­n world in the financial times 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.089
 an extraordinarily important book 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.700
 that says it has essence first that 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.860
 wealth does not reduce the uneven 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.500
 a historical study has been made 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 the subject and then proposes more taxes 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.010
 more or less high what the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.320
 mister france hello 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.899
 and says in addition to this gentleman that the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.480
 inequalities foster instability 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.250
 politics 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.390
 what is your opinion about the book I know 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 that many people could not read it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.409
 because it is 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.409
 many reviews headbands 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.690
 inequalities encourage the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 political polarization and that can 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.310
 generate instability without a doubt 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.980
 because in addition to eroding the environment 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.079
 erode the middle class 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.450
 large large 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.189
 solidly democratic supposedly 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 also but in general it has been 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.990
 countries with large middle classes are more 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.939
 conducive to having democracies when 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
 erodes that then the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.659
 polarization I think the importance 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.810
 I have not read the book, which is also 700 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.810
 pages 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 and there is not much time left verger 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350
 but the important thing is to put on the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.479
 table the issue of inequality 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 finally it's curious it's just now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.439
 when the USA starts talking about 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 inequality speaks to the president in the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.530
 state of the union 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.360
 it is debated in the media and academics 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.219
 are beginning to speak firmly and 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.659
 consistently over inequality the 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.750
 inequality began to grow in this country 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.490
 at the end of the 70s 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.380
 there is a growth inequality is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.230
 call a generation and just now 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.700
 is part of the center of the debate 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.489
 this society 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.290
 and the same is happening in europe and 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.670
 this is generating instability is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.230
 generating the erosion of the parties 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 politicians is generating a huge 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.010
 crisis of representation what it said 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.420
 Jaime previously the young people 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.590
 young people are in the streets because they do not know 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 they feel represented by the system 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.769
 politician do not identify with any 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 party and the parties are in 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.750
 tremendous crises around the world I would say 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.500
 me and the issue of inequality has to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 see with that no doubt and finally I 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.410
 I think it is very important 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
 see this in the Latin American context 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.760
 for all of us depending on the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.860
 inequality has been coming down in many 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.540
 countries but it is starting to rise in 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.819
 other countries in countries that have not known 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.980
 handle the cycle of robust prices 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.890
 of raw materials so 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.140
 rational then you have to have a 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.390
 Long-term look at Latin America 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.920
 also about this temporary reduction 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.480
 of inequality based on our 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.630
 Historical tradition of a deep 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.610
 inequality throughout the region 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.320
 It strikes me that on the part of the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.850
 right of those economists who 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.470
 they believe in small governments in the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.690
 low taxes there has not been any kind 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.250
 of serious response to these 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.220
 these conclusions these theses that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.570
 poses piketty the only answer 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.490
 that there has been really has been 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.990
 discredit the piquet himself and saying 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.910
 who is the favorite economist of 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.480
 hollande that the book is too much 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.300
 French that from demagoguery and that has 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.100
 the theses let's say little 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.070
 raised rather with historical bases 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.440
 and not with mathematical bases will be that the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.570
 right economic model the model of 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.120
 free market of capitalism on the 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.670
 which is this country mounted 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.470
 does not have to argue these theses of 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.799
 piquet and that suddenly it became 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.019
 incontrovertible and I think the fc in the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.560
 column that initiative that the right 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.659
 is eating is not dying of fear 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.090
 it is canada did not cover him model of it 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.459
 and I think the important thing of the book is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.590
 first show that the process of 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.910
 concentration 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.070
 universal in rich countries 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.760
 Take the case of Japan from the countries 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.640
 European 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.210
 from the USA to show that inequality 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.370
 it decreased and fell between the wars 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.460
 but then came back up in a way 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.690
 consistent from the years 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.230
 and today in the USA the richest 10 % of the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.940
 population of has 50% of the income 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.940
 it's the same patamarca 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.500
 that is, it is a record concentration of 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.530
 people 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.640
 clear that accepts the notion of democracy 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.030
 of meritocracy and what he says is that 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.920
 growth alone does not solve 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.040
 the inequality that is the argument of the 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.770
 right when we grow the when the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.350
 water goes up to all neighborhoods that's why 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.300
 they call anti-American now yes and what 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.440
 curious is that the book 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.120
 he did more he had an impasse 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.820
 much greater in the USA 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.330
 in france the book 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.860
 ok but I think he touched on a question 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.200
 that is crucial in the US here is what 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.800
 proposes is that inequality is not that 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.800
 in the process and you have to have policies 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 they contain 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.040
 I think thomas piketty has already 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.020
 become a phenomenon but 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.190
 surely it is possible that it happens to the 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.620
 history as one of the great 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.930
 portraitists of our modern era has 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.030
 managed to perfectly portray what 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.850
 is happening right now is is 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.120
 got put this capitalism hours 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.730
 in front of the mirror to show you where 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.070
 is failing is not doing many 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.960
 characters like sir fukuyama talked 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.460
 of the end of history they want the 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.530
 model of real socialism had 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.890
 failed capitalism was the only 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.660
 plausible option that would be successful and 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.880
 we are realizing that this is not 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.680
 this is false, excessive concentration 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.440
 of the power of wealth 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.500
 has gotten this man practically 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.000
 is going to be in a book phenomena that already 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.009
 they were there that were part of the 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.770
 landscape not long ago the 'subcommander 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.050
 frames' talk about not giving away phrases 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.930
 how are you that the rich follow 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.880
 building great walls make the most 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.560
 higher than the poor in any way 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.300
 the day they are hungry for truth 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.310
 They will climb because because the ferocious 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.750
 age of inequality is there in such a 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.639
 lucky to do great merit I 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.449
 I celebrate 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:52.569
 or at least following the jaime if 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.029
 Capitalism is the only option 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:57.280
 I thought fukuyama well there are many types 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.920
 of capitalism too 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.900
 and a kind of capitalism that 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.630
 is precisely showing up much more 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.090
 voracious than other fairer capitalism 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.919
 more equal balls 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.230
 that was the European capitalism of the 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.419
 a war based on the state 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.520
 of welfare and in redistribution and 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:20.520
 that is also in retraction and that's 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.520
 complicated
