underneath<00:03:55.320> my<00:03:55.500> eyes<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:56.100> make<00:03:56.220> them<00:03:56.370> look

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
underneath my eyes to make them look

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.000 
underneath my eyes to make them look
brighter<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.300> then<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:58.140> right<00:03:58.500> above<00:03:58.740> my

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010

tear drop on my lip and then this is the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.690 
tear drop on my lip and then this is the
luminizing<00:04:03.240> brightening<00:04:03.810> powder<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.430> is

luminizing brightening powder so this is

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.150 
luminizing brightening powder so this is
great<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:07.140> use<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.800> liquid
