sounds like with no mics now here's what

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:19.660 
sounds like with no mics now here's what
it<00:00:54.930> sounds<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.860> both<00:00:56.219> microphones

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.460 

here<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.820> again<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> front

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
here we are again with just the front

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:40.740 
here we are again with just the front
microphone

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:02:03.090 

and<00:01:41.070> finally<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.670> rear<00:01:42.850> microphone<00:02:02.100> now

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
and finally just the rear microphone now

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.130 
and finally just the rear microphone now
in<00:02:03.280> most<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.640> my<00:02:03.729> videos<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.180> tend<00:02:04.540> not<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.840> use<00:02:05.110> a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
in most of my videos I tend not to use a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.719 
in most of my videos I tend not to use a
microphone<00:02:05.710> at<00:02:05.920> all<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.250> give<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.400> true

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
microphone at all to give a true

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.960 
microphone at all to give a true
representation<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.960> Cajon<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:08.830> far<00:02:09.820> as

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
representation of the Cajon as far as

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
representation of the Cajon as far as
microphone<00:02:10.570> positioning<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.440> rear

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
microphone positioning for the rear

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.680 
microphone positioning for the rear
microphone<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.239> place<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
microphone I like to place the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.720 
microphone I like to place the
microphone<00:02:13.870> sideways<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.950> few<00:02:15.370> inches<00:02:15.550> away

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
microphone sideways a few inches away

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
microphone sideways a few inches away
from<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.239> soundboard

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
from the soundboard

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.860 
from the soundboard
this<00:02:17.650> makes<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.310> mic<00:02:18.580> less<00:02:18.970> sensitive<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
this makes the mic less sensitive to the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.110 
this makes the mic less sensitive to the
turbulence<00:02:20.470> generated<00:02:21.100> by<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> air<00:02:21.550> movement

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
turbulence generated by the air movement

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.449 
turbulence generated by the air movement
at<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.420> hole<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:23.560> acting<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.100> little<00:02:24.220> bit

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
at the hole it's acting a little bit

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.150 
at the hole it's acting a little bit
like<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> pop<00:02:24.970> filter<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.690> for<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.650> front<00:02:26.950> like

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
like a pop filter and for the front like

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.190 
like a pop filter and for the front like
the<00:02:27.310> phone<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> place<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.959> few

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the phone I like to place it a few

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
the phone I like to place it a few
inches<00:02:29.380> away<00:02:29.560> from<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.250> top<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> Cajon

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
inches away from the top of the Cajon

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.390 
inches away from the top of the Cajon
making<00:02:31.900> sure<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.260> won't<00:02:32.440> interfere<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
making sure it won't interfere with the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.449 
making sure it won't interfere with the
actual<00:02:33.790> playing<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.510> come<00:02:34.750> home<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:36.310> are

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
actual playing of the come home here are

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.550 
actual playing of the come home here are
the<00:02:36.580> four<00:02:36.850> microphone<00:02:37.420> examples<00:02:37.989> played<00:02:38.260> back

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the four microphone examples played back

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.199 
the four microphone examples played back
to<00:02:38.830> back<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.550> really<00:02:39.850> hear<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
to back so you can really hear the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:03:19.930 
to back so you can really hear the
difference
