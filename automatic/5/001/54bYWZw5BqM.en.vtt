here I'm sure you would find putting up

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.630 
here I'm sure you would find putting up
the<00:02:36.290> beds<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.280> easy<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:42.950> with<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the beds just as easy this is with the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.119 
the beds just as easy this is with the
seats<00:02:44.090> down<00:02:44.390> in<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.720> bed<00:02:44.900> position<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.890> beds

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
seats down in the bed position the beds

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.119 
seats down in the bed position the beds
are<00:02:46.340> actually<00:02:46.700> about<00:02:46.940> six<00:02:47.360> foot<00:02:47.599> six<00:02:47.989> long<00:02:48.470> but

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
are actually about six foot six long but

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.369 
are actually about six foot six long but
obviously<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.940> end<00:02:50.360> right<00:02:51.079> at<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
obviously the the end right at the

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.710 
obviously the the end right at the
sloping<00:02:51.650> end<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:52.700> fully<00:02:52.940> usable<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> can

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
sloping end is not fully usable you can

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.330 
sloping end is not fully usable you can
get<00:02:53.840> your<00:02:53.959> feet<00:02:54.140> out<00:02:54.170> there<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:55.069> if<00:02:55.220> you're

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
get your feet out there and if you're

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.410 
get your feet out there and if you're
lying<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:55.640> your<00:02:55.670> side<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.970> guess<00:02:56.209> you'll<00:02:56.390> be

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
lying on your side I guess you'll be

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.750 
lying on your side I guess you'll be
able<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.079> use<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> four<00:02:57.560> six<00:02:57.799> foot<00:02:58.069> six<00:02:58.250> with

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
your step toe sticking up in the air you

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.860 
your step toe sticking up in the air you
probably<00:03:01.160> couldn't<00:03:01.599> there's<00:03:02.599> a<00:03:02.690> reading

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
probably couldn't there's a reading

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.690
