they're like silk planters find him at a
hobby<00:00:57.120> store<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> original<00:01:00.300> plan<00:01:00.540> was<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hobby store in the original plan was to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.570

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.299 
put one over there on that sign over
here<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.970> side<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.769> basically<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.040> just

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
here on that side and basically I just

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.740 
here on that side and basically I just
wanted<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.910> tank<00:01:06.090> live<00:01:06.300> unified

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
wanted to make the tank live unified

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.180 
wanted to make the tank live unified
like<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> divider<00:01:07.620> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.980> really

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
like because the divider I don't really

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.330 
like because the divider I don't really
like<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.800> gonna<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
guess I was gonna make it look like it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
guess I was gonna make it look like it
was<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.350> tank<00:01:13.850> I'm<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.210> with

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
rock right there see on this row isn't

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.080 
rock right there see on this row isn't
it<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.250> originally<00:01:26.460> gonna<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it and I was originally gonna have a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.180 
it and I was originally gonna have a
stack<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> stack<00:01:28.440> on<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.740> side<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
stack there and a stack on this side so

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.649 
stack there and a stack on this side so
that<00:01:29.220> looked<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.630> both

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that looked like it was the same on both

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.320 
that looked like it was the same on both
sides<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.590> stack<00:01:32.159> there<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.909> also

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
sides like a stack there and also

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.840 
sides like a stack there and also
stacked<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.680> corner<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.430> right

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
stacked back in that corner or right

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.370 
stacked back in that corner or right
here<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> looked<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.050> just<00:01:37.200> went

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
here so it looked like it just went

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.010 
here so it looked like it just went
right<00:01:37.530> through<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> divider<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.020> thought

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
right through the divider but I thought

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.620 
right through the divider but I thought

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
pots is it safe the only thing I could

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.319 
pots is it safe the only thing I could
think<00:02:28.049> of<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.530> um<00:02:28.950> oh<00:02:29.340> yes<00:02:29.549> they're<00:02:29.760> safe<00:02:30.000> but

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
think of is um oh yes they're safe but

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.729 
think of is um oh yes they're safe but
the<00:02:30.450> only<00:02:30.569> thing<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> could<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.319> if<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the only thing I could think of is if it

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.920 
the only thing I could think of is if it
was<00:02:31.860> not<00:02:32.010> safe<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.489> because<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.329> majority<00:02:33.569> of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
was not safe is because a majority of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
was not safe is because a majority of
pots<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.560> buy<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.400> garden<00:02:35.760> stores

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and garden stores tend to have a lot of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.069 
and garden stores tend to have a lot of
fertilizer<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.209> stuff<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.959> any

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079
