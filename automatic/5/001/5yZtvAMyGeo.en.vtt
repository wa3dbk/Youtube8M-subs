00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.530 
impression on me at the 2012 Paris show
was<00:03:45.470> how<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.650> Terra<00:03:46.040> envisions<00:03:46.849> some<00:03:47.150> bold

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
was how the Terra envisions some bold

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.289 
was how the Terra envisions some bold
but<00:03:48.049> believable<00:03:48.530> trends<00:03:48.950> like<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.639> idea<00:03:50.030> that

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
but believable trends like the idea that

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.199 
but believable trends like the idea that
a<00:03:50.359> tablet<00:03:50.930> docked<00:03:51.410> inside<00:03:52.040> becomes<00:03:52.879> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
a tablet docked inside becomes the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.360 
a tablet docked inside becomes the
instrument<00:03:53.690> panel<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.260> navigation<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
instrument panel the navigation and the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.250 
instrument panel the navigation and the
entertainment<00:03:55.790> system<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.660> even<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.139> way

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
entertainment system it's even the way

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.650 
entertainment system it's even the way
you<00:03:57.290> unlock<00:03:57.859> and<00:03:58.069> start<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.639> car<00:03:58.849> putting

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
you unlock and start the car putting

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.150 
you unlock and start the car putting
electric<00:04:00.019> motors<00:04:00.319> at<00:04:00.470> each<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.919> four

electric motors at each of the four

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.159 
electric motors at each of the four
wheels<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.669> also<00:04:02.180> an<00:04:02.269> idea<00:04:02.569> whose<00:04:02.810> time<00:04:02.840> has

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
wheels is also an idea whose time has

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.830 
wheels is also an idea whose time has
likely<00:04:03.889> come<00:04:04.220> offering<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.269> highly

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
likely come offering this highly

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.990 
likely come offering this highly
addressable<00:04:06.379> powertrain<00:04:07.129> and<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.669> reduction

they<00:04:10.760> just<00:04:10.940> gotta<00:04:11.180> throw<00:04:11.480> out<00:04:11.629> that<00:04:11.810> sheet

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
they just gotta throw out that sheet

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.229 
they just gotta throw out that sheet
metal<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:12.470> start<00:04:12.739> again<00:04:13.010> if<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.000> want<00:04:14.209> to
