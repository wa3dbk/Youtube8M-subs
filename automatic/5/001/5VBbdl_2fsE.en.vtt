put the sword in there he hold on to it
a<00:02:10.869> lot<00:02:11.050> better<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.680> first<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.190> came<00:02:15.430> out

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
a lot better so first this one came out

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.440 
a lot better so first this one came out
and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:17.440> they<00:02:17.920> thought<00:02:18.580> maybe<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.300> should

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and then they thought maybe we should

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.870 
and then they thought maybe we should
make<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.630> sonic<00:02:20.110> regular<00:02:20.739> form<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.340> -<00:02:21.519> so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
make a sonic regular form for it - so

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.030 
make a sonic regular form for it - so
all<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.110> make<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.290> again<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:23.890> a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
all they do is make it again just a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.160 
all they do is make it again just a
different<00:02:24.370> hand<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.030> an<00:02:25.299> arm<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.720> pops<00:02:25.930> out

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
different hand and an arm that pops out

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.830 
different hand and an arm that pops out
annoyingly<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:30.519> yeah<00:02:31.030> these<00:02:31.330> are<00:02:31.540> some

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
annoyingly but yeah these are some

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.620 
annoyingly but yeah these are some
pretty<00:02:32.260> great<00:02:32.650> figures<00:02:33.360> some<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.480> them

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
pretty great figures some of them

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.150 
pretty great figures some of them
sometimes<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.530> kind<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.739> hard<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:35.980> can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
sometimes it's kind of hard to can

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.870 
sometimes it's kind of hard to can
withstand<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.959> yeah<00:02:37.959> that's<00:02:38.019> pretty<00:02:38.319> good<00:02:38.440> I
