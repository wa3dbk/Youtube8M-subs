00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.719 

and<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.319> didn't<00:05:53.619> dig<00:05:53.800> any<00:05:54.009> I<00:05:54.099> just<00:05:54.189> cleared<00:05:54.639> away

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
and I didn't dig any I just cleared away

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.350 
and I didn't dig any I just cleared away
the<00:05:54.939> leaves<00:05:55.439> but<00:05:56.439> if<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:56.770> look<00:05:56.949> here<00:05:57.360> you'll

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
the leaves but if you look here you'll

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.070

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
you can make it into candy but it's very

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.570 
you can make it into candy but it's very
easy<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.509> harvest<00:06:40.749> like<00:06:41.709> I<00:06:41.860> said<00:06:42.069> it<00:06:42.219> grows<00:06:42.430> in

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
easy to harvest like I said it grows in
