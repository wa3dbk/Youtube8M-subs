00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
just right under spawn so once you spawn

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.870 
just right under spawn so once you spawn
here<00:00:41.560> you<00:00:41.680> should<00:00:41.830> want<00:00:41.950> to<00:00:41.980> go<00:00:42.040> right<00:00:42.700> down

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
here you should want to go right down

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.330 
here you should want to go right down
here<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.510> keep<00:00:44.440> going<00:00:44.590> down<00:00:44.860> there<00:00:45.160> will<00:00:45.250> be<00:00:45.280> a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
here and keep going down there will be a

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.630 
here and keep going down there will be a
cave<00:00:45.730> but<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:47.110> want<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.650> avoid<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:48.100> cave<00:00:48.310> or

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
cave but you want to avoid that cave or

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.160 
cave but you want to avoid that cave or
you<00:00:48.760> can<00:00:48.880> go<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:49.120> if<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.270> want<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:49.780> that's<00:00:49.900> not

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
you can go in if you want but that's not

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.260 
you can go in if you want but that's not
where<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.410> diamonds<00:00:50.770> are<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.700> you<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:52.120> keep

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
where the diamonds are so you just keep

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.070 
where the diamonds are so you just keep
going<00:00:52.420> down<00:00:52.720> here<00:00:52.780> like<00:00:53.740> this<00:00:54.480> six<00:00:55.480> takes<00:00:55.990> a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
going down here like this six takes a

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.390 
going down here like this six takes a
while<00:00:56.260> not<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:56.620> much<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.980> can<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.160> this<00:00:57.280> in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
while not that much you can do this in

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.980 
while not that much you can do this in
survival<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.000> pretty<00:00:58.210> cool<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.630> there<00:00:58.870> you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
survival it's pretty cool so there you

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.910 
survival it's pretty cool so there you
have<00:00:59.170> iron<00:00:59.440> 4<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.420> get<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.960> diamonds<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:02.830> you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
have iron 4 to get the diamonds so you

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.160
