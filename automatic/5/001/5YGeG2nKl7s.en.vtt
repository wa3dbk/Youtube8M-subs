00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 no matter how comfortable and simple 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.089
 our friends and pads are always with you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.230
 there are beginners who are absolutely in them 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.320
 don't understand anything but want to learn in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.680
 In this case, they are unlikely to need 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 poor manual from standard kit 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.199
 search on the official website of apple.com or 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 worse on google and is unlikely to give 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 the desired results can be helped 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.579
 would be a book 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 but not always wearing it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.239
 comme il faut 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 another thing is the app for everyone 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.450
 ipad generation 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.450
 guru tips for ipad 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.100
 the app is a book on 234 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 pages that are in a convenient form 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.259
 tell and even show how 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.000
 use apple tablet 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:08.460
 page with screenshots and minimum 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.340
 typing flipped through the usual 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.190
 Swipe has a special section with a common 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.539
 number of topics and a useful button 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.210
 chosen by which you can 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.930
 put all your favorite lessons in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.930
 separate section 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.830
 more than two hundred pages of the book so far 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.080
 far failed about force 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.510
 but without this application I like 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.240
 thanks to the meager number of letters and 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.250
 clear screenshots some have 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.530
 even linked videos which 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.530
 can be viewed directly in the program 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.490
 app guru tips for ipad 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.770
 I liked it but there is certainly a couple 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.130
 cons of which you can learn in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.130
