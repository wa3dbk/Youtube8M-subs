00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
we're gonna have our bigger dish and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
we're gonna have our bigger dish and
you're<00:01:29.490> gonna<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> whisk<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> fork<00:01:30.869> if

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you're gonna need a whisk or a fork if

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.969 
you're gonna need a whisk or a fork if
you<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.250> aggressive<00:01:33.380> fork<00:01:34.380> patterns

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you have very aggressive fork patterns

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
you have very aggressive fork patterns
you<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.180> beater<00:01:36.450> or

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you can do that to you or a beater or

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
you can do that to you or a beater or
two<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.650> I've<00:01:37.860> softened<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.759> little

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
two but I've softened this up a little

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.260 
two but I've softened this up a little
bit<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:40.229> should<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.700> easy<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bit so this should be pretty easy to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.399 
bit so this should be pretty easy to
combine<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.130> our<00:01:44.250> butter<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.409> just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
combine so we got our butter and just

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
combine so we got our butter and just
see<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
see if we can kind of get in there and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
see if we can kind of get in there and
push<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.810> bit<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.500> gonna<00:01:49.619> add<00:01:49.829> our

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
push it up a bit and we're gonna add our

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.959 
push it up a bit and we're gonna add our
sugar<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> mix<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:54.409> there<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.500> go

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
sugar to the mix so there we go

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.959 
sugar to the mix so there we go
kinda<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.469> beaters<00:01:58.969> your

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
kinda just get in there the beaters your

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.830 
kinda just get in there the beaters your
fork<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:03.000> everything<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:04.040> situated<00:02:05.040> he

fork and get everything all situated he

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
fork and get everything all situated he
might<00:02:06.840> need<00:02:06.990> some<00:02:07.229> attention<00:02:08.129> especially<00:02:08.369> if

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
might need some attention especially if

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.249 
might need some attention especially if
you're<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:08.910> using<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.239> beater<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.140> do

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you're not using a beater you can do

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
you're not using a beater you can do
this<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> fork<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.920> sure<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.819> hands

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
if you get

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.780 
if you get
and<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.150> actually<00:02:15.420> working

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and do it so this is actually working

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.690 
and do it so this is actually working
there<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:17.970> go

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
there we go

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.190 
there we go
so<00:02:20.700> you'll<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.210> when<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.750> starts<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.080> look

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so you'll see when it starts to look

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.010 
so you'll see when it starts to look
combined<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> butter

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
combined because it's just the butter

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.720 
combined because it's just the butter
connecting<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.290> mushing<00:02:25.890> together<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
connecting and mushing together with the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.500 
connecting and mushing together with the
sugar<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.290> combining<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:30.300> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
sugar we are combining all right so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.110 
sugar we are combining all right so
we've<00:02:30.660> combined<00:02:31.080> our<00:02:31.410> butter<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.920> our<00:02:32.010> sugar

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
we've combined our butter and our sugar

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.240 
we've combined our butter and our sugar
and<00:02:33.120> once<00:02:33.390> that's<00:02:33.570> all<00:02:33.720> smooth<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.350> toss

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and once that's all smooth you can toss

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.210 
and once that's all smooth you can toss
in<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.700> almond<00:02:36.060> milk<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.860> your<00:02:37.860> vanilla

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
in your almond milk and your vanilla

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.700 
in your almond milk and your vanilla
extract<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.720> combine<00:02:40.500> again<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> we're

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
extract and combine again so we're

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.700 
extract and combine again so we're
combining<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.700> sugar<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.930> butter<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
combining the sugar the butter the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.100 
combining the sugar the butter the
almond<00:02:47.070> milk<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.240> vanilla<00:02:48.270> extract<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
almond milk and the vanilla extract and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.250 
almond milk and the vanilla extract and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
then we're going to combine in the rest

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
then we're going to combine in the rest
