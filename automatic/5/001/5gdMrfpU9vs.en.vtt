00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.500
 we feel that they used the little 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.780
 model of the ace powder for that we're going 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.620
 prepare a dessert a lemon pie and 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.960
 so they would be red 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.500
 you have to take it there like a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.900
 fountain pen near the mine you got it 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.540
 filled it's a half wanted July 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.860
 in drops 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.730
 these moments more important when you 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.090
 will come on the plate you 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.700
 put yourself vertically 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.410
 it remained vertical as the grout 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.410
 can flow well into the funnel 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.719
 we will decorate it with another grout and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.890
 always holds like a pen you have 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.350
 seen near the mine and we'll do some 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.039
 points mentioned well vertical one 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.539
 wait a bit for the biggest points 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:58.999
 a little less time and always 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:02.390
 rising and now we have more than 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.800
 ask the lemon pie now 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.540
 how to use the grand hotel de las 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.060
 powder for that we will prepare a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.470
 piece of beef mashed pumpkin and its 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.560
 I also held there like a pen l must 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.850
 well to garnish their hatching have left 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.850
 fall shoot 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.770
 which is also interesting to watch 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 you will see we will come with the juice 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:38.240
 in the pure yes I take the middle and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.240
 I come from bath gilles martel verdure 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.790
 and I put my pieces of beef 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.370
 we prepared a fish with the 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.600
 brush lay a cod fillet 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:00.430
 curry sauce and are self-portraits 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.580
 room the risotto already knew how to do to the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.580
 House 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.300
 then that's when it changes 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.780
 usually we want to use the cave 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.570
 european price to present the sauce on 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.570
 holds it half full 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.470
 it retains vertical well we start again 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.760
 we half filled her she follows them on 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.710
 went down so that the gout 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.710
 form although a vertical well material 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.150
 noise more to put the fish on 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:48.209
 the horizon all the cod so good 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.209
 path 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.719
 and that's like we're still 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.150
 pen is that it works like a 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.909
 pen you charge lancre which is the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.069
 fruit coulis slightly hand and 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.069
 think about the future well right look 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.549
 we will write lemon to present our 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.549
 lemon pie 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.329
 I leave space for the pie 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:20.480
 I end up with the m I did a series of 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:26.389
 points below have recalled less 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.739
 a long time, but also the 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:38.810
 arabesques and I put a little in 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:41.780
 the corner of the plate in flexibility and I 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:47.480
 just put my lemon pie instead 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.709
 from the top here is the lemon effect for 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.019

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.239
 write macaroons she in the word pause 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.609

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.930
