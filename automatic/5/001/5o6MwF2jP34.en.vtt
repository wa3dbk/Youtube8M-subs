is it comes down to the quarterback play

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.890 
is it comes down to the quarterback play
and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.630> solid

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and I think you're going to get solid

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770 
and I think you're going to get solid
guys<00:01:37.140> solid<00:01:37.710> play<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.100> both<00:01:38.460> guys<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.600> what

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
guys solid play from both guys the what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210

they<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.140> us<00:01:40.439> though<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> their

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
they have on us though is that their

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
they have on us though is that their
backup<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> backup<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.740> know

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
backup is really not a backup you know

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.260 
backup is really not a backup you know
when<00:01:44.100> dalzell<00:01:44.549> went<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.970> had<00:01:45.000> Chris

when dalzell went down we had Chris

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
when dalzell went down we had Chris
Sanders<00:01:45.600> come<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> who<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> true<00:01:46.710> rookie<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
Sanders come in who is a true rookie and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
Sanders come in who is a true rookie and
you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.329> he<00:01:48.540> went<00:01:48.689> down<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.229> won

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you know he went down you know we won

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
you know he went down you know we won
all<00:01:49.530> those<00:01:49.649> games<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.490> mostly<00:01:50.640> like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
all those games but it was mostly like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
all those games but it was mostly like
like<00:01:51.570> four<00:01:51.720> centers<00:01:51.960> play<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.530> mostly

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
like four centers play but was mostly

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.160 
like four centers play but was mostly
because<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> wide<00:01:54.720> receivers

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
because of you know the wide receivers

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
because of you know the wide receivers
were<00:01:55.290> able<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:56.189> blue<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.790> metal<00:01:57.030> catches

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
earlier this season just like those

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.729 
earlier this season just like those
elvia<00:02:39.159> but<00:02:40.030> Boehner<00:02:40.239> came<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.049> took<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
elvia but Boehner came in and took the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.589 
elvia but Boehner came in and took the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
reins and one of those games i think

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.089 
reins and one of those games i think
graciana<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.109> going<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.290> play<00:02:44.470> no<00:02:44.739> he's<00:02:44.890> kind

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
graciana is going to play no he's kind

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.800 
graciana is going to play no he's kind
of<00:02:45.159> banged<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:46.030> i<00:02:46.090> think<00:02:46.329> he'll<00:02:46.480> come<00:02:46.629> in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
of banged up but i think he'll come in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 
of banged up but i think he'll come in
because<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.200> test<00:02:47.440> brought<00:02:47.709> us<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.609> if<00:02:48.700> he

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
because the test brought us but if he

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.940 
because the test brought us but if he
can't<00:02:49.030> play<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.359> whole<00:02:49.510> game<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:50.620> don't<00:02:50.799> get<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
can't play the whole game we don't get a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
can't play the whole game we don't get a
huge<00:02:51.489> advantage<00:02:51.639> with<00:02:52.060> having<00:02:52.299> Bonner<00:02:52.480> come

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
huge advantage with having Bonner come

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.660 
huge advantage with having Bonner come
in<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.200> we're<00:02:54.069> going<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.430> tough<00:02:54.489> time

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
in so we're going to have a tough time

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.629 
in so we're going to have a tough time
with<00:02:55.000> Philadelphia<00:02:55.799> it's<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.920> big<00:02:57.099> game<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
with Philadelphia it's a big game you

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.680 
with Philadelphia it's a big game you
know<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:57.879> not<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.150> those<00:02:58.239> medical<00:02:58.540> break

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
