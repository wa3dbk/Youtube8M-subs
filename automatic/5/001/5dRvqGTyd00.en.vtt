they don't have the resources and
expertise<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:51.899> implement<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.530> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
expertise to actually implement it so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
expertise to actually implement it so
they<00:00:52.890> might<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> volunteer<00:00:53.969> come<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they might have a volunteer come in and

integrity that the church that people to
church<00:01:08.549> hat<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
church hat so they don't have that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
integrity than they might you know just

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
integrity than they might you know just
basically<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.110> their<00:01:13.229> money<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
basically take them for their money and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
basically take them for their money and
not<00:01:13.860> give<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.250> high<00:01:14.670> quality<00:01:15.119> website<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
not give them high quality website so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.149 
not give them high quality website so
when<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:16.560> seeing<00:01:16.680> those<00:01:16.860> type<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
when we're seeing those type of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
when we're seeing those type of
situations<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.270> started<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> realize<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
situations I started to realize that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.130 
situations I started to realize that
what<00:01:20.130> they<00:01:20.280> needed<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.939> someone<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.080> could

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
what they needed was someone they could

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
what they needed was someone they could
trust<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.100> someone<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.729> has<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trust and then someone that also has the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.670 
trust and then someone that also has the
expertise<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.900> allow<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
expertise to allow them to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.530 
expertise to allow them to
you<00:01:27.430> know<00:01:27.520> technology<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.180> we<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.300> out

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
you know technology that we have out

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.120 
you know technology that we have out
here<00:01:28.570> because<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.110> changes<00:01:29.440> rapid

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.010

innovative they wanna new shiny you know
new<00:01:41.149> thing<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.630> block<00:01:41.840> they<00:01:42.619> also

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
new thing on the block they also

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.889 
new thing on the block they also
understand<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:43.700> want<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.420> content

understand that they want a content
management<00:01:45.200> system<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.799> something<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.189> they

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
management system so something that they

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.940 
management system so something that they
can<00:01:46.689> when<00:01:47.689> they<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:48.020> website<00:01:48.409> gets<00:01:48.590> done<00:01:48.799> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
can when they the website gets done and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.830 
can when they the website gets done and
hand<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.219> off<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.340> them<00:01:49.579> from<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.090> developer<00:01:50.750> or

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
hand it off to them from a developer or

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.569 
hand it off to them from a developer or
something<00:01:51.079> like<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.200> they<00:01:51.560> can<00:01:51.740> still<00:01:51.950> work

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
something like that they can still work

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.429 
something like that they can still work
with<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.240> they<00:01:53.360> understand<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.020> part<00:01:54.289> of

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
with it so they understand that part of

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.679 
with it so they understand that part of
it<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:55.219> they<00:01:55.340> don't<00:01:55.520> understand<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.420> just

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
it what they don't understand is just

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.949 
it what they don't understand is just
the<00:01:58.179> expertise<00:01:59.179> that<00:01:59.209> it<00:01:59.479> takes<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.869> actually

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
the expertise that it takes to actually

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.109 
the expertise that it takes to actually
develop<00:02:00.319> that<00:02:00.860> they<00:02:01.369> may<00:02:01.520> not<00:02:01.579> understand

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
develop that they may not understand

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.240 
develop that they may not understand
that<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.569> stuff<00:02:02.780> they<00:02:02.929> see<00:02:02.990> that's<00:02:03.829> easy<00:02:04.100> for

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
that the stuff they see that's easy for

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.710 
that the stuff they see that's easy for
them<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.429> use<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.819> website<00:02:05.179> might<00:02:05.420> take

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
them to use on the website might take

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.770 
them to use on the website might take
weeks<00:02:06.439> or<00:02:06.860> months<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.310> develop<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.660> may

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
weeks or months to develop so they may

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.600 
weeks or months to develop so they may
not<00:02:08.810> they<00:02:09.079> don't<00:02:09.229> understand<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.739> part<00:02:09.769> then

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
not they don't understand that part then

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.520 
not they don't understand that part then
they're<00:02:10.910> starting<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.209> understand<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
they're starting to understand that the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
they're starting to understand that the

know they need a website because they

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.330 
know they need a website because they
