00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
more on the pentatonic scale bag when I

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.490 
more on the pentatonic scale bag when I
learned<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.580> different<00:00:26.360> positions<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:27.050> felt

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
learned the different positions I felt

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.710 
learned the different positions I felt
very<00:00:27.680> uncomfortable<00:00:27.890> if<00:00:28.520> I<00:00:28.669> had<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.360> move<00:00:29.480> from

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
very uncomfortable if I had to move from

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.140 
very uncomfortable if I had to move from
one<00:00:29.930> position<00:00:30.110> to<00:00:30.410> another<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
one position to another and this is a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.299 
one position to another and this is a
good<00:00:32.360> way<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.629> learn<00:00:33.020> placed<00:00:33.739> your<00:00:33.949> next-door

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
good way to learn placed your next-door

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.299 
good way to learn placed your next-door
neighbor<00:00:34.670> within<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> pentatonic<00:00:35.690> scales

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
neighbor within the pentatonic scales

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.740 
neighbor within the pentatonic scales
first<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.670> first<00:00:37.820> position<00:00:38.300> we<00:00:38.449> are<00:00:38.480> going<00:00:38.690> to

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
first the first position we are going to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.140 
first the first position we are going to
use<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.199> second<00:00:42.500> one<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.120> a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
use is and the second one and this is a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.140 
use is and the second one and this is a
good<00:00:47.300> way<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.540> move<00:00:48.350> from<00:00:48.589> one<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:49.699> second

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
good way to move from one to the second

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.280 
good way to move from one to the second
position<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:52.570> we're<00:00:53.570> starting<00:00:53.750> on<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.140> two

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
position so we're starting on the two

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.850 
position so we're starting on the two
high<00:00:54.500> strings<00:00:55.930> first<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.199> fourth<00:00:57.440> finger

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
high strings first and fourth finger

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.079 
high strings first and fourth finger
sliding<00:00:58.339> with<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.729> fourth<00:00:58.970> finger<00:00:59.239> up<00:00:59.510> and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
sliding with the fourth finger up and

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.149 
sliding with the fourth finger up and
here<00:01:02.089> we<00:01:02.150> normally<00:01:02.690> should<00:01:02.900> use<00:01:03.170> our<00:01:03.710> second

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
here we normally should use our second

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.240 
here we normally should use our second
finger<00:01:04.190> but<00:01:04.699> this<00:01:05.089> time<00:01:05.770> you're<00:01:06.770> using<00:01:07.010> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
finger but this time you're using the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.010 
finger but this time you're using the
first<00:01:07.820> think<00:01:08.090> instead<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.659> then<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.869> can

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
first think instead and then you can

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:18.330 
first think instead and then you can
slide<00:01:09.260> back

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.190 

and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:19.550> we're<00:01:19.730> doing<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.660> same<00:01:20.900> thing

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
and then we're doing this the same thing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.690 
and then we're doing this the same thing
on<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> next<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.980> two<00:01:22.670> strings<00:01:24.040> first<00:01:25.040> third

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
on the next to two strings first third

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.690 
on the next to two strings first third
first<00:01:26.090> fourth<00:01:26.570> sliding<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.920> we<00:01:28.400> can<00:01:28.520> use

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
first fourth sliding up and we can use

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.750 
first fourth sliding up and we can use
the<00:01:29.240> fingering<00:01:29.780> we're<00:01:29.990> supposed<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.470> use<00:01:30.620> it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
the fingering we're supposed to use it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:42.370 
the fingering we're supposed to use it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the next to strange is a little more

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.200 
the next to strange is a little more
tricky<00:02:02.710> normally<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.920> should<00:02:04.159> use<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.939> first

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
tricky normally you should use the first

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the fourth finger and stick and then you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.120 
the fourth finger and stick and then you
can<00:02:13.160> slide<00:02:13.430> up<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.940> C

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
can slide up to the C

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
stretching here but and that to me it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.559 
stretching here but and that to me it
sounds<00:02:35.040> better<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.340> me<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:36.150> using<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
sounds better for me when I'm using the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.059 
sounds better for me when I'm using the
fourth<00:02:36.840> finger<00:02:38.780> good<00:02:39.780> choice<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.349> on<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.410 
last two low strings again
first<00:02:46.110> fold<00:02:46.739> first<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:49.010> again<00:02:50.010> there's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
first fold first and here again there's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.839 
first fold first and here again there's
a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.900> thing<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.890> careful
