00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 this new video tutorial speaks to them its 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.019
 server and there in this video we are going to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.869
 learn how 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.570
 How to verify which driver makes us 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.750
 missing how to download the original driver 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.079
 since many of us have had problems with 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.270
 do this form we have a computer and 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.009
 we forgot to make a backup or 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.770
 we simply want to update the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.899
 driver because it's slow because the 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.649
 computer no longer works with this 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.890
 old and good driver let's do it 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.260
 with two internet pages but if you 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.360
 you want to do it with programs in the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.170
 description of the video I leave my page 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.570
 Web 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.860
 in the category of programs you are going to 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.020
 access what is programs and you go to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 find the driver that 'news is 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:00.280
 cracked full and the driver and if those 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.110
 programs are very good for what is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839
 for what it is to verify its drivers and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 download them 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.310
 in the description of the video you also 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 I will be leaving two pages in which 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 are the ones that we are going to use 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.520
 well we 're going to go to our browser 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.400
 to our browser and once we 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.420
 let's be here 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.500
 we are going to place the rl of the first 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
 page 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.600
 this page is very good it's called my my 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.860
 own dotcom conflict 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.080
 and that page gives us start the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.570
 detection of what everything is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.960
 all our computer the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.170
 controllers an analysis the monitoring 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.220
 in short many things we are going to click on 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.220
 start detection 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.320
 once here you are scanning what 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.530
 What is it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.120
 here it tells us that to detect all the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.990
 Windows settings 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.630
 we need a then Czech plugin of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.650
 how many bits is your computer is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.280
 compatible with almost all 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.459
 the browsers is the internet 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 explorer and mozilla firefox google chrome 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.709
 he operates the safari 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.219
 so it's compatible and comes 32 and 64 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.870
 bits simply download the plugin 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:37.480
 why 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.080
 can start the detection of your windows 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.080
 okay 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.610
 let's see that yes 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.610
 let's update the page 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:55.310
 and let's wait for it to be installed 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.880
 as we still see why we installed 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.010
 ask for the plugin 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.010
 well once it is already installed 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.610
 Now, as you see, it does not come out what it is 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.610
 our user name him 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.170
 in our computer 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.900
 and is analyzing all all the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 components all the drivers that we 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.940
 miss 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.690
 depending on how many you need 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.000
 I can do the speed or the slowness of 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.010
 what is the page 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.590
 well here we already get the name the date 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.180
 of detection the base version the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.430
 version of plugin modules leave us 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.970
 the operating system the processor the 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.100
 motherboard chipset memory 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.400
 graphics card the hard drive the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.700
 readers I decided the network the cards 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.520
 multimedia keyboards screens 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.430
 peripherals and once you already 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.430
 see all this we are going to give 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.310
 up here find the controllers 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.540
 as they see me, I need many 1 2 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.130
 3 4 5 so finishing the video then the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.739
 I will update simply if you 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.729
 you want to do it you're going to give in download and 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.970
 is going to take you to what is the page 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.810
 where you can download the driver 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.789
 ok and good so easy if you use 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.520
 this page then I'm going to do it 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.830
 finishing recording the second page is 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.080
 single dotcom drivers 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.240
 this page is very good 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.139
 I also recommend and here you can 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.680
 find thousands of thousands of drivers 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.139
 that can serve either for as they see 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.110
 up the categories for your camera to 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.560
 your capture for the controllers of 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.090
 the motherboard for the recorders 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.340
 printers monitors portable mouse the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.689
 sound etcetera etcetera here come 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.580
 also in the categories of what they are 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:18.229
 the brands the most judged for example 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:22.669
 the hp the epson the intel are the most 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:25.039
 searched or can you here put this the 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.430
 driver and so you know specifically 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.870
 for example 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.310
 the real text 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.860
 well and you automatically look for it as 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.490
 it came out we all all the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.310
 drivers with that name and well well of 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.830
 easy you can 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.850
 you can download your drivers from a 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.220
 safely and that there are no problems 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.190
 I hope this video has served you 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.300
 do you have any problems with the pages 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.180
 remember that I am leaving you one too 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.880
 programs on the website so that 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.120
 you use and I want to tell you that I will be a 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.300
 little absent from what is youtube and from 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.830
 facebook since as I see I'm going to 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.630
 enter the school again 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.180
 and well that was all I hope you like 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.120
 this video and see you until next 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.830
