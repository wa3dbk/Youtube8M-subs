00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.570
 we have tried some urban 300 vehicles 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.390
 that a feature that is that of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 have two wheels on the front 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 stable more secure than any other two 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 existing wheels handy and practical in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.449
 fun city to use outside in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.970
 hilly roads therefore a vehicle that 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.190
 lends itself to city use because no 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.800
 to make the trip out of town 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.559
 excellent in braking very low fuel consumption 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 empty core from this 300 engine that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.590
 develops 22 horsepower for which 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.229
 excellent accelerations the sensations of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.910
 driving are those of a normal scooter 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 in quiet situations however extreme 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.369
 security and stability with this alley 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.649
 it feels like glued to the road 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 here is a unique feature of the mp3 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.179
 we can say that this is it 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 the one that allows the vehicle by entering 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.140
 the rock 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 then the stabilizer that locks 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 front suspension to ensure that it does not 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 It is just south alone 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.360
 to unlock it then very simple there 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.350
 there are two away one acting on his 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.509
 switch or otherwise when the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.360
 half in motion simply accelerated 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.829
 so it allows you to do things 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.460
 a little out of the ordinary 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.380
 then brake a little more firmly than the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.390
 without losing grip and stability e 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.750
 without the vehicle being broken down into 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.920
 case of slopes and also provided with a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.310
 vehicle handbrake at about 10 liters of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.470
 capacity to its autonomy of 25 30 km 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.670
 with an actual book allows you to 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.640

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720

 if you want you can take the ride quietly 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.049
 in our beautiful mountains because no to

 Unbeatable roads are not always optimal 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.100
 pavilion size for the bumps 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.139
 potholes 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.420
