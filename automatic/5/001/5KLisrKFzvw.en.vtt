bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF: It was the day after
the big speech for President Obama, and day

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.960
one of his campaign to sell a new economic
program to Congress and the country. Ray Suarez

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.340
has that story. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So
this bill will help people on unemployment.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.980
RAY SUAREZ: The president took his jobs plan
on the road, to the University of Richmond

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.960
in Virginia and a crowd of 8,000. BARACK OBAMA:
Now, everything in the American Jobs Act,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.369
everything in there is the kind of proposal
that's been supported in the past by both

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.700
Democrats and Republicans. Nothing radical
in this bill. Everything in it will put more

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.660
people back to work and more money back into
the pockets of those who are working. (CHEERING

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.370
AND APPLAUSE) MAN: The president of the United
States! RAY SUAREZ: The president rolled out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.240
his American Jobs Act in last night's address
to a joint session of Congress. It would cost

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.210
just under $450 billion, including some $250
billion in tax breaks, mostly in the form

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.580
of payroll tax cuts for workers and employers.
There's also nearly $200 billion in new spending

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.050
for public works, unemployment benefits and
aid to the states. The president has vowed

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.260
the jobs act will be fully paid for, and he's
asking the new deficit super committee to

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.230
help find ways to do that. He also says he
will offer new deficit cutting ideas of his

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.600
own, including curbs on Medicare and Medicaid,
in 10 days time. Overall, White House officials

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.880
project nearly 1.9 million jobs will result
from the plan. But, first, it has to win approval

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.950
in Congress. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
challenged Republicans today to work with

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.979
the president. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-Calif.
House minority leader: So I think it's about

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.530
not between the Democrats and the Republicans.
It's about the American people. And I think

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.060
that will give an opening to work in a bipartisan
way. But I think we have to be respectful.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.870
I don't think we have to confront. I think
we just should see where we can find our common

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.390
ground. BARACK OBAMA: You want a tax break...
RAY SUAREZ: To that end, the president staged

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.980
his event today in the Virginia district of
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the chamber's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.910
number-two Republican. BARACK OBAMA: I'm an
optimistic person. I believe in America. I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.030
believe in our democracy. I believe that if
you just stay at it long enough eventually,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.270
after they have exhausted all the options,
folks do the right thing. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.260
RAY SUAREZ: Earlier, Cantor spoke on the House
floor and called for accommodation. REP. ERIC

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.700
CANTOR, R-Va. House majority leader: The president
came last night, and there were several things

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.500
and proposals within his speech that seemed
to reflect some areas that we can both agree

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.319
on and build towards consensus. This is an
opportunity for us to set aside the differences

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.170
that we have, because good people can differ,
and begin to focus on things like allowing

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.690
tax relief for small business, like allowing
for the rollback of regulatory impediments

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.530
that stand in the way of small business growth.
RAY SUAREZ: But on the campaign trail, there

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.800
was little talk of common ground from the
president's Republican challengers. Minnesota

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.060
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann came out swinging
shortly after Mr. Obama spoke to Congress.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.010
REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, R-Minn. presidential
candidate: And I stand here tonight to say

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.849
to the president, not only should Congress
not pass his plan. I say, Mr. President, stop.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.210
Your last plan hasn't worked, and it's hurting
the American economy. RAY SUAREZ: And in a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:46.790
Web video, the Mitt Romney campaign called
the Obama economic policies a failure. The

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.629
president will continue to push for public
support for his program in the coming days,

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.770
with rallies next week in Ohio and North Carolina.
