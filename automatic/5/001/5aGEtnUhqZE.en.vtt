00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
safety and accident prevention so we can

safety and accident prevention so we can
be<00:01:46.280> proud<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.580> what<00:01:46.880> has<00:01:47.030> been<00:01:47.180> achieved<00:01:47.240> but

we<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:49.040> also<00:01:49.280> agree<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:49.850> zero<00:01:50.420> risk<00:01:50.780> is

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
we can also agree that zero risk is

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.340 
we can also agree that zero risk is
unattainable<00:01:51.650> as<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:53.360> late<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:54.049> have<00:01:54.170> become

unattainable as of late we have become

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.260 
unattainable as of late we have become
much<00:01:54.710> more<00:01:55.010> aware<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.670> dramatic

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
much more aware of the dramatic

ongoing development and thinking is that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.570 
ongoing development and thinking is that

we prepare our ships for the one thing
with<00:02:07.820> rather<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.450> think<00:02:08.720> about<00:02:08.990> at<00:02:09.200> all

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.849 

first<00:02:12.790> we<00:02:13.359> must<00:02:13.599> make<00:02:13.810> sure<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.140> pollutants

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
first we must make sure that pollutants

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.179 
first we must make sure that pollutants
don't<00:02:15.249> enter<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> ocean<00:02:16.590> secondly<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
don't enter the ocean secondly the
