00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you draw if you can hear that if you do

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.730 
you draw if you can hear that if you do
a<00:01:48.670> quick<00:01:48.999> swipe<00:01:49.240> there<00:01:50.049> are<00:01:50.170> snowflakes<00:01:50.380> are

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
a quick swipe there are snowflakes are

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.429 
a quick swipe there are snowflakes are
bigger<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.539> if<00:01:52.539> you<00:01:53.369> alternate<00:01:54.369> normal<00:01:55.439> if

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
bigger and if you alternate normal if

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.279 
bigger and if you alternate normal if
you<00:01:56.560> hold<00:01:56.770> down<00:01:56.859> they<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:57.969> smaller<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> you

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
you hold down they get smaller so you

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.440 
you hold down they get smaller so you
can<00:01:59.380> do<00:01:59.469> some<00:01:59.499> detailed<00:02:00.100> things<00:02:00.219> here<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
can do some detailed things here and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.989 
can do some detailed things here and
i'll<00:02:01.719> just<00:02:01.869> say<00:02:03.899> hey<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.139> then<00:02:06.130> leave<00:02:06.909> it

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
i'll just say hey and then leave it

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.059 
i'll just say hey and then leave it
there<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:07.209> a<00:02:07.389> second<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> send

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
there for a second and you see a send

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.140 
there for a second and you see a send
button<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:11.319> there<00:02:12.780> ok<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.050> missed<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
button right there ok I missed it I so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.480 
button right there ok I missed it I so
send<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.870> has<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> nice<00:02:17.560> animation<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
send it and has a nice animation and it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
send it and has a nice animation and it
flies<00:02:18.940> away

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
flies away

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.000 
flies away
so<00:02:21.049> that's<00:02:21.170> pretty<00:02:21.349> much<00:02:21.439> it<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
so that's pretty much it and then you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.649 
so that's pretty much it and then you
can<00:02:22.159> start<00:02:22.900> drawing<00:02:23.900> again<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:26.390> is

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
can start drawing again and that is

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.940 
can start drawing again and that is
pretty<00:02:26.870> much<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.140> that's<00:02:27.409> all<00:02:27.530> point<00:02:27.799> but

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
pretty much it that's all point but

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.259 
pretty much it that's all point but
there<00:02:28.189> are<00:02:28.310> some<00:02:28.430> other<00:02:28.579> things<00:02:28.610> look<00:02:28.970> into

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
there are some other things look into

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.240 
there are some other things look into
and<00:02:29.510> by<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.110> way<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.470> want<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.709> erase<00:02:30.950> all

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
and by the way if you want to erase all

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.559 
and by the way if you want to erase all
you<00:02:31.489> do<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.180> give<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> shake<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:35.299> erase
