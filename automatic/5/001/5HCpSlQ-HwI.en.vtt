notice is just the better build quality
it's<00:00:29.310> still<00:00:29.580> enough<00:00:29.880> by<00:00:30.119> today's<00:00:30.449> standards

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900

pretty<00:00:31.529> big<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.130> terms<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.059> watch<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pretty big in terms of a watch but it's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
pretty big in terms of a watch but it's
still<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.340> they're<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:36.030> compact

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
still all the time they're more compact

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
still all the time they're more compact
than<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> previous<00:00:37.260> version<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.219> the

get to this but it's really simple this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
get to this but it's really simple this
one<00:01:00.120> handy<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.260> there's<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> front<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
one handy the there's a front the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
one handy the there's a front the
cameras<00:01:02.579> been<00:01:02.760> moved<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.539> no<00:01:03.660> longer<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
cameras been moved so it's no longer a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440 
cameras been moved so it's no longer a
camera<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> band<00:01:04.860> itself<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
camera on the band itself so it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
camera on the band itself so it's
actually<00:01:06.720> put<00:01:06.869> into<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> housing<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
actually put into the housing and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.480 
actually put into the housing and
anything<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.900> now

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
anything about that is that it's now

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.410 
anything about that is that it's now
water-resistant<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> could<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.150> with

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
water-resistant so you could take with

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
water-resistant so you could take with
you<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> shower

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

responsive<00:01:35.250> every<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> might

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
responsive every now and then you might

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.249 
responsive every now and then you might
see<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> delayed

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
see just a little bit of a delayed

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
see just a little bit of a delayed
operation<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> most<00:01:38.729> part<00:01:38.880> still

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
operation but for the most part still

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.080 
operation but for the most part still
tolerable<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> back<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.340> you'll<00:01:41.790> notice

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
tolerable in the back here you'll notice

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
tolerable in the back here you'll notice
that<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.390> still<00:01:42.659> even<00:01:43.049> require<00:01:43.470> the
