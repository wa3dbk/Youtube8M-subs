00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600 

I'm<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> changing<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.800> fingering<00:01:02.250> around

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.119 
I'm kind of changing my fingering around
a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.619> large<00:01:04.860> your

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a little bit if you have large your

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.040 
a little bit if you have large your
hands<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.630> definitely

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
hands which I do not you can definitely

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.290 
hands which I do not you can definitely
do<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:08.040> third<00:01:08.280> finger<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.850> move<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
do your third finger here and move it to

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.420 
do your third finger here and move it to
the<00:01:09.479> tenth<00:01:09.690> fret<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:10.890> easier<00:01:10.920> for

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the tenth fret but it's much easier for

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
the tenth fret but it's much easier for
me<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:11.729> pinky<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> keep<00:01:13.170> my

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
me to use my pinky if I have to keep my

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.100 
me to use my pinky if I have to keep my
middle<00:01:14.070> finger<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.210> let's<00:01:15.659> play<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.900> nice

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
middle finger down so let's play it nice

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:26.180 
middle finger down so let's play it nice
and<00:01:16.409> slow

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.760 

or<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.370> can<00:01:27.520> do<00:01:27.700> what<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.750> want<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.500> happen<00:01:29.560> to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
or you can do what I want to happen to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.410 
or you can do what I want to happen to
my<00:01:29.890> brain<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.280> don't<00:01:30.460> know<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:31.000> also<00:01:31.180> do

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
my brain I don't know you can also do

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:42.840 
my brain I don't know you can also do
sliding<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.930> that's<00:01:41.140> two<00:01:41.770> ways<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.550> can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
sliding so that's two ways that you can

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.230 
sliding so that's two ways that you can
finger<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.330> again<00:01:44.700> since<00:01:45.700> i<00:01:45.880> have<00:01:45.970> smaller

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
finger it again since i have smaller

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.420 
finger it again since i have smaller
hands<00:01:46.540> i<00:01:46.810> have<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.320> kind<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.620> i<00:01:47.860> have<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.280> do

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
hands i have to kind of i have to do

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.820 
hands i have to kind of i have to do
some<00:01:48.670> alternative<00:01:49.270> ways<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.590> pinky

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
some alternative ways and so the pinky

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.710 
some alternative ways and so the pinky
is<00:01:51.040> much<00:01:51.280> easier<00:01:51.310> for<00:01:51.940> me<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:52.300> i'm<00:01:52.390> sure<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.630> lot

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
is much easier for me but i'm sure a lot

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.850 
is much easier for me but i'm sure a lot
of<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.020> can<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.410> with<00:01:53.530> your<00:01:53.650> third<00:01:53.830> finger

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
of you can do it with your third finger

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.610 
of you can do it with your third finger
and<00:01:54.490> slide<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.970> up<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.990> way<00:01:56.110> that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
and slide it up so do it that way that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.530 
and slide it up so do it that way that
is<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.100> hardest<00:01:57.550> part<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:57.970> song<00:01:58.150> if<00:01:58.330> you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
is the hardest part of the song if you

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.420 
is the hardest part of the song if you
don't<00:01:58.750> want<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.960> do<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.080> line<00:01:59.470> all<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.280> have

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.430 
don't want to do that line all you have
to<00:02:00.580> do
