hand<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:35.860> see<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.160> symbol<00:02:36.490> here<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
hand we see in the symbol here in the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.780 
hand we see in the symbol here in the
front<00:02:36.910> which<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.350> wizard<00:02:38.710> logo<00:02:39.550> which

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
front which is on the wizard logo which

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.790 
front which is on the wizard logo which
is<00:02:39.880> pretty<00:02:40.030> cool<00:02:40.270> there<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.530> can<00:02:41.650> take<00:02:41.710> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
is pretty cool there and we can take a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.740 
is pretty cool there and we can take a
look<00:02:41.950> at<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.070> bottom<00:02:42.370> which<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.000> plain

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
look at the bottom which is just plain

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.840 
look at the bottom which is just plain
plastic<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.380> some<00:02:44.590> copyright<00:02:44.950> information

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
plastic with some copyright information

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.270 
plastic with some copyright information
there<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.570> that's<00:02:46.750> basically<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.140> for<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
there so that's basically it for the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.850 
there so that's basically it for the
outside<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.360> box<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.930> let's<00:02:50.110> take<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> look<00:02:50.440> look

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
outside of box so let's take a look look

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.980 
outside of box so let's take a look look
at<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.190> inside<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.700> box<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.420> get<00:02:52.630> inside

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
at the inside of a box so to get inside

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.840 
at the inside of a box so to get inside
the<00:02:53.140> box<00:02:53.320> all<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.830> do<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.190> lift<00:02:54.610> these

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
the box all you have to do is lift these

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.620 
the box all you have to do is lift these
two<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:55.360> latches<00:02:55.780> here<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.380> Oprah<00:02:57.480> as<00:02:58.480> you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
two little latches here and Oprah as you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.360 
two little latches here and Oprah as you
can<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.410> hear<00:02:59.740> some<00:03:00.100> on

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
can see there you hear some on

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.480 
can see there you hear some on
ratcheting<00:03:01.360> sounds<00:03:01.870> which<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.590> basically<00:03:03.010> how

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
ratcheting sounds which is basically how

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.700 
ratcheting sounds which is basically how
it<00:03:03.520> holds<00:03:03.940> up<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.320> open<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
it holds up so if you have it open and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.900 
it holds up so if you have it open and
display<00:03:05.950> dope<00:03:06.160> we<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.340> actually<00:03:06.460> stay<00:03:06.730> that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
display dope we can actually stay that

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.610 
display dope we can actually stay that
way<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.660> let's<00:03:07.870> take<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.050> look<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.350> inside

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
way so let's take a look at the inside

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.550 
way so let's take a look at the inside
of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.800> box<00:03:09.030> more<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.360> wood<00:03:10.780> molding<00:03:11.290> here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
of the box more on wood molding here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.320 
of the box more on wood molding here
which<00:03:11.740> is<00:03:11.860> very<00:03:12.070> nice<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.430> highlight<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
which is very nice a highlight like that

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.140 
which is very nice a highlight like that
kind<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.600> like<00:03:13.750> would<00:03:14.290> mold<00:03:14.620> mold<00:03:15.430> look<00:03:15.790> there

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
kind of like would mold mold look there

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.500 
kind of like would mold mold look there
makes<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.600> look<00:03:16.750> would<00:03:17.560> instead<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.160> plastic

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
makes it look would instead of plastic

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.479 
makes it look would instead of plastic
so<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.930> have<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.230> actual<00:03:20.440> top<00:03:20.950> part<00:03:21.280> of

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
so here we have the actual top part of

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.330 
so here we have the actual top part of
the<00:03:21.580> OP<00:03:22.270> was<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.200> ring<00:03:23.470> box<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:24.040> that

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the OP was a ring box you can see that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.970 
the OP was a ring box you can see that
this<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.610> beneath<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.270> top<00:03:26.050> lid<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.830> you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
this is beneath the top lid and as you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.800 
this is beneath the top lid and as you
see<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.250> have<00:03:27.430> one<00:03:27.700> two<00:03:27.850> three<00:03:27.880> four<00:03:28.270> five<00:03:28.300> six

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
see we have one two three four five six

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.990 
see we have one two three four five six
