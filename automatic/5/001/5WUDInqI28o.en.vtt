00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.540 
Zin and then I was like wait a minute
how<00:00:39.180> am<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.360> even<00:00:39.390> gonna<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.460> was

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
how am I even gonna get it out and I was

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
how am I even gonna get it out and I was
kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> panicking<00:00:42.300> because<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.870> like

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
kind of panicking because I was like

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
kind of panicking because I was like
there's<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.950> no<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> out

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
there's just no way you can get this out

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
there's just no way you can get this out
and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.149> wasn't<00:00:45.300> even<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.629> attempt<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> try

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and I wasn't even gonna attempt to try

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
and I wasn't even gonna attempt to try
to<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:48.450> any<00:00:48.600> other<00:00:48.840> means

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to take it out by any other means

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
to take it out by any other means
because<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.190> closely<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.390> space<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
because if you look closely the space is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
because if you look closely the space is
just<00:00:52.440> too<00:00:52.649> tight<00:00:52.920> between<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> pen<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
just too tight between the pen and the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.910 
just too tight between the pen and the
palette<00:00:54.120> itself<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> didn't<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> risk

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
palette itself but I didn't want to risk

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
palette itself but I didn't want to risk
cracking<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> eyeshadows<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
cracking the eyeshadows I did use a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
cracking the eyeshadows I did use a
needle<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.629> know<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> ten<00:01:01.350> i<00:01:01.379> shadow

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

pout<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.219> got<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> found<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pout that I got when I found out that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.359 
pout that I got when I found out that
you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.860> couple<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.339> other

they<00:01:07.200> used<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.369> found<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they used but then I found that the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.899 
they used but then I found that the
needle<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.040> too<00:01:11.220> thin<00:01:11.520> it

would<00:01:12.060> Bend<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.320> wasn't<00:01:13.680> strong

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
would Bend and it just wasn't strong

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
would Bend and it just wasn't strong
enough<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.369> pull<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> whole<00:01:15.119> pan<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.740> safely

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
enough to pull the whole pan out safely

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.719 
enough to pull the whole pan out safely
without<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.689> cracking<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:20.070> eyeshadow

how I take out the eyeshadows really
quickly<00:01:56.729> especially<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> look

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
quickly especially if you want to look

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.319 
quickly especially if you want to look
at<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> color<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> color<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> shade

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
at the color because the color the shade

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
at the color because the color the shade
is<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> bottom<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> pallets<00:02:02.509> on

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is in at the bottom of the pallets on

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
is in at the bottom of the pallets on
the<00:02:03.840> Inglot<00:02:04.110> eye<00:02:04.140> shadows<00:02:04.680> or<00:02:04.979> even<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the Inglot eye shadows or even if you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
the Inglot eye shadows or even if you
want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.090> switch<00:02:06.270> them<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:07.110> whatnot<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
want to switch them out or whatnot so

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.360 
want to switch them out or whatnot so
pretty<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.179> take<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.720> magnet<00:02:10.370> put

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
pretty much you just take the magnet put

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220 
pretty much you just take the magnet put
it<00:02:11.489> over<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.120> eyeshadow

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
it over the eyeshadow

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.050 
it over the eyeshadow
and<00:02:13.319> as<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.370> sucked<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.030> right

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and as you can see just sucked it right

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.280 
and as you can see just sucked it right
up<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:17.640> case<00:02:17.970> you're<00:02:18.180> wondering<00:02:18.300> oh<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
up in case you're wondering oh that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.790 
up in case you're wondering oh that
ruins<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> eyeshadow<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.519> actually<00:02:21.090> doesn't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
ruins the eyeshadow it actually doesn't

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.770 
ruins the eyeshadow it actually doesn't
if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.950> look<00:02:23.250> closely<00:02:23.519> there's<00:02:23.910> no<00:02:24.150> makeup<00:02:24.420> at

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
if you look closely there's no makeup at

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.400 
if you look closely there's no makeup at
all<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.010> magnet<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.989> pan<00:02:28.379> is

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
all on the magnet and the pan is

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.759 
all on the magnet and the pan is
perfectly<00:02:29.310> intact<00:02:30.019> any<00:02:31.019> smudging<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> see

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
perfectly intact any smudging you see

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.339 
perfectly intact any smudging you see
there<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.069> pretty<00:02:32.280> much<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.670> my<00:02:33.180> finger<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.050> I

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
there is pretty much just my finger so I

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.259 
there is pretty much just my finger so I
had<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.160> nothing<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> magnet

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
had it's nothing to do with the magnet

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.620 
had it's nothing to do with the magnet
and<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.769> pretty<00:02:37.980> safe<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> look<00:02:39.360> closely

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
and it's pretty safe if you look closely

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.170 
and it's pretty safe if you look closely
on<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.170> pan<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.860> pans<00:02:41.099> itself<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
on this pan on the pans itself the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.380 
on this pan on the pans itself the
products<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:42.840> filled<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.769> brim<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
products not filled to the brim so the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
products not filled to the brim so the
metal<00:02:45.690> parts<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.230> little<00:02:46.590> bit<00:02:46.709> more<00:02:46.920> raised<00:02:47.220> so

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
metal parts a little bit more raised so

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.210 
metal parts a little bit more raised so
that<00:02:47.670> when<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> magnet

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that when it actually is on the magnet

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.860 
that when it actually is on the magnet
it's<00:02:50.819> kind<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.299> you<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.780> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
it's kind of like you know think of it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
it's kind of like you know think of it
like<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.049> u-shape<00:02:52.709> where<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.299> only

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
like a u-shape where you know it's only

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.870 
like a u-shape where you know it's only
touching<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.920> know<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.099> top<00:02:56.310> part<00:02:56.640> of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
touching the you know the top part of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.390 
touching the you know the top part of
the<00:02:57.060> metal<00:02:57.329> pan<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.400> eyeshadow

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the metal pan but not the eyeshadow

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.440 
the metal pan but not the eyeshadow
itself<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.500> definitely<00:03:01.970> by<00:03:02.970> far<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
itself so definitely by far is the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.620 
itself so definitely by far is the
safest<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.500> quickest<00:03:05.280> method<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.970> taking<00:03:06.420> out

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
safest and quickest method of taking out

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.280 
safest and quickest method of taking out
your<00:03:06.900> Inglot<00:03:07.500> eyeshadows<00:03:08.160> carefully<00:03:09.290> without

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
your Inglot eyeshadows carefully without

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.699 
your Inglot eyeshadows carefully without
damaging<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.900> again<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.200> mean<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> could

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
damaging it so again I mean you could

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.100 
damaging it so again I mean you could
pretty<00:03:13.920> much<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.519> pop<00:03:15.450> about<00:03:15.750> like<00:03:15.930> that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
pretty much just pop about like that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.479 
pretty much just pop about like that
with<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> magnet<00:03:16.769> they<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.069> come<00:03:17.280> off

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
with the magnet they just come off

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.740 
with the magnet they just come off
really<00:03:18.090> easily<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.959> again<00:03:19.889> they<00:03:20.040> don't

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
really easily and again they don't

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.979 
really easily and again they don't
damage<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.109> eyeshadow<00:03:22.560> pans<00:03:22.889> at<00:03:23.069> all<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
damage the eyeshadow pans at all and

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.610 
damage the eyeshadow pans at all and
it's<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:26.280> pretty<00:03:26.609> nifty<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.959> comparison<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it's it's pretty nifty in comparison to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.379 
it's it's pretty nifty in comparison to
the<00:03:28.889> old<00:03:29.040> method<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.609> was<00:03:29.880> doing<00:03:30.239> we're

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
the old method that I was doing we're

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.539 
the old method that I was doing we're
trying<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.750> pop<00:03:31.049> them<00:03:31.260> out<00:03:31.380> with<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.430> know

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
trying to pop them out with the you know

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.210 
trying to pop them out with the you know
tiny<00:03:32.850> safety<00:03:33.420> pin<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.829> definitely

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
tiny safety pin and you can definitely

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.699 
tiny safety pin and you can definitely
take<00:03:35.400> two<00:03:35.639> two<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> same<00:03:37.079> time<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
take two two out at the same time if you

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.360 
take two two out at the same time if you
wanted<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:39.260> such<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> time<00:03:40.620> saver<00:03:40.650> because

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
wanted to it's such a time saver because

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.610 
wanted to it's such a time saver because
it<00:03:41.489> would<00:03:41.609> take<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:42.030> literally<00:03:42.329> like<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:43.530> know

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
it would take me literally like you know

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.129 
it would take me literally like you know
three<00:03:43.950> minutes<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.730> pull<00:03:45.359> out<00:03:45.569> one<00:03:45.810> pan

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
three minutes just to pull out one pan

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.490 
three minutes just to pull out one pan
but<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:47.420> know<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> lot<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.930> people<00:03:49.319> were

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
but I know that a lot of people were

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.729 
but I know that a lot of people were
saying<00:03:50.090> or<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.150> know<00:03:51.299> suggesting<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.079> try

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
saying or you know suggesting to try

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.440 
saying or you know suggesting to try
taking<00:03:53.310> them<00:03:53.430> out<00:03:53.549> using<00:03:53.970> these<00:03:54.060> small

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
taking them out using these small

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.599 
taking them out using these small
magnets<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.109> were<00:03:55.230> on<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.530> lid<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:56.099> I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
magnets that were on the lid but I

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.520 
magnets that were on the lid but I
noticed<00:03:57.060> watching<00:03:57.480> YouTube<00:03:57.840> videos<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
noticed watching YouTube videos that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.680 
noticed watching YouTube videos that
this<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.099> method<00:03:59.670> was<00:03:59.790> more<00:04:00.000> effective<00:04:00.450> with

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
this that method was more effective with

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.500 
this that method was more effective with
the<00:04:00.930> smaller<00:04:01.859> Inglot<00:04:02.430> eye<00:04:02.670> shadows<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.359> were

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the smaller Inglot eye shadows that were

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.589 
the smaller Inglot eye shadows that were
around<00:04:04.760> which<00:04:05.760> by<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.030> way<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.329> being

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
around which by the way are being

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.259 
around which by the way are being
discontinued<00:04:07.410> from<00:04:08.160> what<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.579> makeup<00:04:08.849> artist

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
discontinued from what the makeup artist

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.789 
discontinued from what the makeup artist
at<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.419> Newport<00:04:09.810> Beach<00:04:10.019> store<00:04:10.260> was<00:04:10.470> telling

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
at the Newport Beach store was telling

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.569 
at the Newport Beach store was telling
me<00:04:10.859> they're<00:04:11.040> actually<00:04:11.310> gonna<00:04:11.459> be

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
me they're actually gonna be

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.640 
me they're actually gonna be
discontinued<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.510> they're<00:04:13.109> only<00:04:13.290> gonna<00:04:13.470> be

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
discontinued so they're only gonna be

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.449 
discontinued so they're only gonna be
carrying<00:04:13.919> these<00:04:14.190> square<00:04:14.730> eyeshadow<00:04:15.329> palettes

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
carrying these square eyeshadow palettes

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.890 
carrying these square eyeshadow palettes
but<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.700> problem<00:04:18.090> with<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.660> it's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
but the problem with this is that it's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.039 
but the problem with this is that it's
just<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.169> strong<00:04:19.709> enough<00:04:19.739> no<00:04:20.370> matter<00:04:20.579> where<00:04:20.849> I

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
just not strong enough no matter where I

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.480 
just not strong enough no matter where I
you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.079> trying<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.680> angle<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.099> and<00:04:23.250> pick<00:04:23.460> it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
you know trying to angle it and pick it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.390 
you know trying to angle it and pick it
up<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.210> was<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:24.900> budging<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:26.130> think

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
up it just was not budging and I think

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.110 
up it just was not budging and I think
because<00:04:26.640> it's<00:04:26.789> square

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
because it's square

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270 
because it's square
shadows<00:04:27.479> are<00:04:27.630> just<00:04:27.660> heavier<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.620> weight<00:04:28.860> that

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
shadows are just heavier and weight that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.680 
shadows are just heavier and weight that
it's<00:04:29.669> just<00:04:29.850> not<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.030> strong<00:04:30.330> enough<00:04:30.540> to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
it's just not a strong enough to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.150 
it's just not a strong enough to
magnetize<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.229> can<00:04:31.350> see<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.650> really<00:04:31.830> tiny

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
magnetize you can see it's really tiny

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.480 
magnetize you can see it's really tiny
to<00:04:32.970> lift<00:04:33.180> these<00:04:33.360> up<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.889> not<00:04:35.040> only<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.310> I

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
to lift these up and not only that I

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.510 
to lift these up and not only that I
just<00:04:35.639> think<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.330> by<00:04:36.600> trying<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.310> pick<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.430> up

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
just think that by trying to pick it up

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.879 
just think that by trying to pick it up
this<00:04:38.729> way<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> mean<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.780> would<00:04:40.139> just<00:04:40.290> be<00:04:40.440> fearful

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
this way I mean I would just be fearful

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.770 
this way I mean I would just be fearful
of<00:04:41.130> trying<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.669> scratch<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.300> surface<00:04:42.570> with

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
of trying to scratch the surface with

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.950 
of trying to scratch the surface with
the<00:04:43.080> corner<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.830> lid<00:04:44.600> which<00:04:45.600> obviously

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
the corner of the lid which obviously

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.500 
the corner of the lid which obviously
kind<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.320> defeats<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> purpose<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:47.449> you<00:04:48.449> know

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
kind of defeats the purpose of you know

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.260 
kind of defeats the purpose of you know
preventing<00:04:49.430> your<00:04:50.430> eyeshadows<00:04:50.880> from<00:04:50.970> being

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
preventing your eyeshadows from being

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.460 
preventing your eyeshadows from being
ruined<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:52.040> definitely<00:04:53.040> check<00:04:53.100> out<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:55.350> know

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
ruined so definitely check out you know

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.080 
ruined so definitely check out you know
your<00:04:55.650> local<00:04:55.860> hardware<00:04:56.220> store<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.639> pick<00:04:57.060> up

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
your local hardware store and pick up

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.730 
your local hardware store and pick up
these<00:04:57.360> heavy-duty<00:04:57.900> magnets<00:04:58.139> because<00:04:58.500> they

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
these heavy-duty magnets because they

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.250 
these heavy-duty magnets because they
will<00:04:59.040> make<00:04:59.940> your<00:05:00.120> life<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.300> much<00:05:00.720> easier<00:05:00.780> when

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
will make your life so much easier when

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.159 
will make your life so much easier when

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
it comes to these Inglot eyeshadows and

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.659 
it comes to these Inglot eyeshadows and
pulling<00:05:04.169> them<00:05:04.260> out<00:05:04.380> of<00:05:04.590> their<00:05:04.949> pallet<00:05:05.310> so

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
pulling them out of their pallet so

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.670 
pulling them out of their pallet so
that's<00:05:06.240> pretty<00:05:06.600> much<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.050> hope<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:07.530> was

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that's pretty much it I hope that was

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.120 
that's pretty much it I hope that was
