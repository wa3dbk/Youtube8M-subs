00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.580
Fading mind

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.780
I can feel it, I can feel it

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.940
On my skin

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.580
Appears the dark sign

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580
I am bleeding, I am bleeding

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
Empty void of soul

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.400
I'm hollow, I am hollow

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080
Fear the dark sign

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.320
Eternal life

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.920
Decay of flesh

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.440
Decay of mind

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.380
Now everything fades

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.900
With this wicked fate

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.520
Brother now lost without a trace

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:07.160
Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.840
A once loyal heart

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.300
I have fallen, I have fallen

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.680
From Grace

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.340
It shames me now

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.740
But I'd betray you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.820
I'd draw my sword for this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.840
Im hollow

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.740
Fear the dark sign

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.820
Eternal life

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.860
Decay of flesh

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.940
decay of mind

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.640
Now everything fades

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.800
With this wicked fate

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.220

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840
Remember my name

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.520
For I'm gone

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.400
Brother I've failed you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.280
Let my strength live on in you now

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.420
Here's my sword

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.360
Here's my shame...

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.240
I beg of you....

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.600
Remember my name

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780
Fear the dark sign

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.280
Eternal life

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.380
Decay of flesh

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.340
decay of mind

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.700
Now everything fades

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.880
With this wicked fate

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.360
Brother now lost without a trace

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:32.780
Where are you? (8x)
