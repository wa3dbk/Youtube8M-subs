for<00:06:37.640> this<00:06:37.729> i<00:06:37.909> think<00:06:38.150> it<00:06:38.330> requires<00:06:38.450> a<00:06:38.780> lot<00:06:38.900> more

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
for this i think it requires a lot more

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.980 
for this i think it requires a lot more
teamwork<00:06:39.500> to<00:06:39.710> be

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
teamwork to be

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.300 
teamwork to be
cessful<00:06:40.290> the<00:06:40.410> battlefield<00:06:40.800> us<00:06:40.980> and<00:06:41.130> you<00:06:41.190> guys

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
like wait I know but I'm not saying it's

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.560 
like wait I know but I'm not saying it's
a<00:06:43.620> better<00:06:43.770> game<00:06:43.830> I<00:06:44.190> just<00:06:44.370> say<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.270> you

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
a better game I just say that you you

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.880 
a better game I just say that you you
have<00:06:45.690> to<00:06:45.780> rely<00:06:45.990> on<00:06:46.020> your<00:06:46.230> teammates<00:06:46.290> a<00:06:46.680> lot

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
have to rely on your teammates a lot

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.440 
have to rely on your teammates a lot
more<00:06:47.070> in<00:06:47.160> that<00:06:47.280> game<00:06:47.460> than<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:47.730> do<00:06:47.850> in<00:06:48.030> most

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
more in that game than you do in most

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.420 
more in that game than you do in most
any<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.780> game<00:06:48.900> I've<00:06:49.020> ever<00:06:49.050> played<00:06:49.290> so<00:06:50.130> I

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
any of the game I've ever played so I

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.310 
any of the game I've ever played so I
think<00:06:50.820> the<00:06:51.120> possibility<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.720> this<00:06:51.990> channel

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
think the possibility that this channel

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.720 
think the possibility that this channel
could<00:06:52.470> be<00:06:52.560> posting<00:06:53.010> up<00:06:53.100> games<00:06:53.280> like<00:06:53.490> future

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
could be posting up games like future

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.670 
could be posting up games like future
soldier<00:06:54.090> or<00:06:54.390> medal<00:06:54.840> of<00:06:54.870> honor<00:06:55.020> warfighter<00:06:55.200> is

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
soldier or medal of honor warfighter is

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.890 
soldier or medal of honor warfighter is
a<00:06:56.010> definite<00:06:56.460> possibility<00:06:57.030> you<00:06:57.570> don't<00:06:57.720> always

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
a definite possibility you don't always

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.210 
a definite possibility you don't always
want<00:06:58.020> to<00:06:58.230> stick<00:06:58.350> to<00:06:58.470> one<00:06:58.620> thing<00:06:58.650> because<00:06:59.070> we're

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
want to stick to one thing because we're

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.680 
want to stick to one thing because we're
not<00:06:59.370> getting<00:06:59.580> another<00:06:59.760> battlefield<00:07:00.090> game<00:07:00.420> for

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
a long time in this game eventually

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.290 
a long time in this game eventually
