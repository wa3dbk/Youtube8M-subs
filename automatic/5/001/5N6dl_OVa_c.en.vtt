00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 the difference between the launch week 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.770
 the first and second chapter 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 resident evil revelations two looks 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.210
 which took longer than usual to 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 to pass to the final the quality game being 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 well-built makes fans 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.010
 expectations were 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 adventure of claire mora barry and natÃ¡lia 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.930
 episode 2 contemplation has the task 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 to overcome a consistent pilot 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 besides continuing the history and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
 present novelties that please the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.329
 player with the plot presented here with 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 now has the freedom to expand the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 and increase levels of action and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 thriller 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.550
 the tension we try to avoid the spoilers 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 but some surprises are inevitable 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 for those who did not play the first episode 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 or do not want to know what happens in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 second, but does this chapter 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.949
 maintains the level and still leaves that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.239
 I like the taste of want more 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 starting from where Chapter 11 ended 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.079
 contemplation shows claire lives following 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.699
 towards the tower 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.440
 they are accompanied by survivors 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 of the land serves that it also seeks a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.920
 exit of the island 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 the characters are not detailed but 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.170
 their presence is important for the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.000
 plot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 already barry is still in search of his daughter 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 finding more clues 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 The problem is that someone or something observes 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.100
 every move your documents 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 found in the campaign give clues 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 the new virus called te fobos e 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340
 activated according to fear felt by the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 infected 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 as well as expanded history maps 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.829
 became larger 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 we have a fishing village with a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 time for homes remembering resident evil 4 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.290
 outside parts of a city and a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 hospital 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 this mysterious tower scenery are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.759
 especially macabre and well designed 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 assuring attention to new enemies 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.590
 follow the formula of the series the creature 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 invisible and infected virus with a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.159
 electric weapon 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 despite the repetition the introduction of them is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.220
 very well made 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.500
 creature that can not be seen by 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.869
 example has a special ability that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 makes you despair and seek new 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.189
 cooperative strategies 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.680
 as well as in tv series and in the own 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.329
 episode colony penal contemplation has 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 an incredible final hook 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.509
 the revelation of the last seconds together 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 with a document explaining the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.470
 villain's motivations is made so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.420
 correct and surprising 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 making you much more anxious for 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.830
 next some mysteries remain 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.390
 in the air as the origin of Natalia and trauma 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.100
 of memory allowing the two 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 remaining episodes also has its 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.000
 own bombastic surprises but the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.340
 capcom needs to take care that one of the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 most fun aspects of the game do not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.780
 make it a failure to revisit the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.820
 same locations and until the resolution of 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.100
 puzzles for both pairs of the campaign 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.840
 It is true that the rescue story does 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.060
 with which barry goes back to places where 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.060
 claire mora have been before but 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 Exaggeration can make gambling tiresome 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.850
 especially when it comes to collecting 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.250
 achievements 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.740
 the appeal is not bad but it was a bit 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.000
 badly used in this episode other 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.830
 problem is that the subtitles in Portuguese 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.330
 Brazil have gotten much worse than the first 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.060
 chapter here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.130
 now they can even confuse the player 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 translations that transform the word 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.400
 siren nymph and bar bar and explain 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.000
 lack of revision of chapter 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.010
 resident evil contemplation 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.410
 revelations two maintain a high level 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.910
 quality of the previous episode and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.610
 with which the game arrives in the middle of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.500
 duration with a great perspective the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.959
 levels of action and suspense are amplified 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
 more enemies at the same time on the screen and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.670
 tension in search of ammunition in one place 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.250
 safe at the same time history progresses 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.200
 in the right rhythm following the title of the game 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.150
 jaw-dropping revelations are made 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.530
 fans of the series making the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.560
 want to play the third episode 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.519
 only the new enemy scenarios are 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.989
 good options 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.450
 despite the creatures being versions 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.760
 repaginated from other games in the series 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.070
 Maps are already a double-edged sword. 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 they are bigger and better built 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.320
 but the repetition of paths between claire 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.660
 release as much as is justifiable is 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.370
 exaggerated and becomes tiresome some 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.110
 points of the first chapter remain 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.820
 such as absence of cooperative online mode 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.620
 and the lack of deadlines 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.840
 the subtitles in Portuguese continuous of bad 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.850
 quality and to worsen can even 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.630
 compromise gambling for poor translations 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.459
 made 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.190
 already with two very solid episodes 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.200
 revelations 2 proves more and more that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.359
 even without high-end graphics and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.430
 presenting specific problems 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.430
 it is a game to be contemplated 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:29.030
 check out the full review on DJ 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.300
 the next videos and until the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.300
 next
