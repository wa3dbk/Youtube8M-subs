00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.350 
like this color it smells like but it's
probably<00:06:08.680> really<00:06:09.009> old<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:09.969> actually<00:06:10.180> is

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
probably really old it actually is

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.019 
probably really old it actually is
really<00:06:10.599> old<00:06:11.069> but<00:06:12.069> I<00:06:12.310> don't<00:06:12.580> have<00:06:12.729> that

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
really old but I don't have that

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:15.870 
really old but I don't have that
reaction<00:06:13.569> to<00:06:14.080> make<00:06:14.259> up<00:06:14.409> like<00:06:15.279> some<00:06:15.460> people<00:06:15.699> can

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
reaction to make up like some people can

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.430 
reaction to make up like some people can
so<00:06:16.090> i<00:06:16.120> use<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.360> anyway<00:06:16.750> but<00:06:16.810> if<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.080> have<00:06:17.199> soft

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
so i use it anyway but if you have soft

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.749 
so i use it anyway but if you have soft
edge<00:06:17.620> it's<00:06:17.919> one<00:06:18.159> of<00:06:18.219> the<00:06:18.310> perfect<00:06:18.550> ones<00:06:18.669> you

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
edge it's one of the perfect ones you

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.080 
edge it's one of the perfect ones you
can<00:06:18.880> use<00:06:19.000> right<00:06:19.120> after<00:06:19.360> red<00:06:19.810> lipstick<00:06:21.090> but

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
can use right after red lipstick but

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.029 
can use right after red lipstick but
spring<00:06:22.630> bean<00:06:22.810> it's<00:06:23.080> really<00:06:23.440> really<00:06:23.710> good<00:06:23.740> to

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
spring bean it's really really good to

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.360 
spring bean it's really really good to
use<00:06:24.219> if<00:06:24.819> you<00:06:25.000> do<00:06:25.150> a<00:06:25.180> lot<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.360> Browns<00:06:26.130> it's<00:06:27.130> also

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
use if you do a lot of Browns it's also

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.100 
use if you do a lot of Browns it's also
it's<00:06:27.610> also<00:06:27.699> good<00:06:28.060> lie<00:06:28.210> can<00:06:28.389> be<00:06:28.599> like<00:06:28.779> a<00:06:28.840> soft

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.219 
it's also good lie can be like a soft
brown<00:06:29.349> liner<00:06:29.650> just<00:06:30.039> set<00:06:30.250> these<00:06:30.400> comment<00:06:30.849> down
