 worthy of indigogo open

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.490
 whistle everyone upstairs to set sail 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490
 forward to news 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.979
 remember such a beautiful phenomenon 90 as 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.530
 mighty rangers it was just 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.290
 gorgeous TV series the day was all super 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.390
 heroes and villains battles big robots and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.979
 so on there by the way there seemed to be even mine 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.049
 Brian Cranston's favorite actor 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.210
 but it's not about him the other day the network was 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.700
 Squad temple project announced only 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.009
 look at the video yes these are the same 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.149
 mighty rangers really see y 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.130
 developers did not grow together 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.380
 rights holders so the title and on 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.399
 and the very project of the temple warehouse immerse us 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.320
 not outside the rangers 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.330
 about filmmaking series about the adventures 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.610
 brave fighters yes you understood correctly 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.979
 in the game we equip a studio we hire 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 actors orom light camera motor after 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.759
 what step by step deal with 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.090
 the same villains and watch for 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.340
 ratings fun yes somehow not so but 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 true for me it would be possible and just 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 fights themselves leave without camera lighting 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.060
 studios so on because that was 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.890
 the most posh mighty rangers 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.540
 Well, the project seems to have successfully completed 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.620
 campaign on kickstarter and soon 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.420
 preparing for the exit 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.700
 and maybe everything is much better than me 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.910
 described here come out chrome squad and there 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.910
 we'll see 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.720
 if you think that you have as an amateur 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 hands like games have nothing to surprise then I 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 at least try the fact that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.460
 literally recently ended with vanda 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.350
 ruble chalendzh 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.660
 jam in which developers need 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.490
 was to create a project like the genre and if 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.830
 most made their games by canon 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.930
 genre then some experimented and 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.640
 even combined genres with each other in 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.650
 the result of one such mixing and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.030
 project was born variable and if 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.760
 try to describe it briefly then 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.920
 get room like plus tag now 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.410
 in more detail the cartago is divided into real 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.480
 squares you start on central and 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.490
 should you move left or right and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.020
 kill the enemies that appear as you will 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.330
 shown which way you are allowed 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.360
 move square sector and why 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.380
 begs the question everything is just a matter of 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.300
 that from the right location 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.190
 the squares on the map will depend your 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.740
 transition to another level is not resolved 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.080
 riddle no way out well here, too, have their 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.820
 problems each time moving the square 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.070
 monsters will spawn again creating 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.470
 you a lot of problems and objects without it 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.780
 no movement at all to find but a project 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.250
 looks quite interesting if you give birth to 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.280
 him play then follow the link in 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.280

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.160
 I hear accuracy about him for the first time most 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.350
 festival participants free giving

 this event is a big plus as well as 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.590
 opportunity to play some see on 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.239

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.709
 the most but sorted games by the following 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.260
 categories better game better plot 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.670
 best writing best siding 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.549
 great puzzles 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.720
 Excellent mpehi and the best 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.239
 individual puzzle 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.070
 talk about all the games of these categories 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.380
 there is no sense for the time for the story I 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.870
 I will spend a lot of games and this is essentially 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.550
 no different to those who come to 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.110
 delight of the wonderful interactive 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.419
 story on the trail independently about the movie 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.940
 tape sites and try games but not 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:45.790
 forget the knowledge of English 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:47.440
 to play otherwise you won't understand anything for a long time 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.480
 in king she had projects from ours 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.310
 developers and hey misunderstandings 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.740
 try to fix a moment told you about 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.750
 unusual magic project for dummies than 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.310
 its unusual but at least in that 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.290
 what is all the content given visual 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.570
 novels give us poems not like u 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.220
 Pushkin of course but all the same unusual but 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.720
 let's leave the gameplay for last 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.060
 but first I'll go to you about the plot 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.430
 once the protagonist named kip 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.040
 had a dream as if his legs refused 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.140
 and then he decided to fight so pumped up 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.770
 various patches and cheats right in 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.290
 your brain 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.630
 but what dreams are far from reality there 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.950
 Everything is possible but when our keep wake up 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.320
 the began to notice some 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.670
 particular oddities if he submit 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.350
 what plays the game in real life 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.490
 can do the same things as 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.930
 in-game protege 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.050
 also he can find all sorts of artifacts 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.790
 and anomaly 1 by the way takes and sucks 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.620
 him to an unknown world where magic is everywhere 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.410
 and here it begins the main storyline 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.660
 part we have to help the bale learn 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.880
 local magic defeat evil sorcerers and 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.430
 wizards and learn about how it works 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.830
 abilities and of course save the world 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.510
 where do without it though it depends 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.520
 the ending of which by the way is expected 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.770
 4 pieces project first 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.690
 a visual novel but the developer decided 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.669
 to diversify reading texts with mini games 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.560
 by type three in a row which is not the plot 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.110
 influence and exists only to replenish 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.000
 mana and battles those who played on the hall 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.680
 Quest immediately understood how it works 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.900
 also the developer added to the game 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.790
 a variety of different easter eggs on 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.320
 the plot they also do not affect but for those who 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.180

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.370
