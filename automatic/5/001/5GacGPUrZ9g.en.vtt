all of these many aspects of teamwork
the<00:00:27.689> challenge<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.949> fact<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:31.230> our<00:00:31.410> world

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the challenge the fact that in our world

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
have to meet it so Formula Student you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
have to meet it so Formula Student you
have<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> prepare<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> car<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.829> design

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

it<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it you have to make it and you have to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
it you have to make it and you have to
turn<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> day<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> compete<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.000> it

turn up on the day and compete with it
there's<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:48.360> choice<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> helps

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there's no choice and I think it helps

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
there's no choice and I think it helps
to<00:00:50.340> bring<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> discipline<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.440> way

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to bring a lot of discipline to the way

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
to bring a lot of discipline to the way
you<00:00:52.680> work<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.649> there<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.680> an

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you work because there is a there is an

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520 
you work because there is a there is an
end<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.940> data<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.379> to

end game there's a data when you have to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.209 
end game there's a data when you have to
have<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.890> car<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.649> Formula<00:01:01.649> Student<00:01:01.680> brings

Formula<00:01:35.310> Student<00:01:35.340> teams<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:37.260> was<00:01:37.380> something

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
Formula Student teams it was something

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
Formula Student teams it was something
that<00:01:37.890> didn't<00:01:38.400> happen<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.910> was<00:01:39.060> at

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that didn't happen when I was at

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.470 
that didn't happen when I was at
university<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.470> wish<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:40.980> had<00:01:41.160> done<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.300> I

on<00:01:45.480> Formula<00:01:45.870> Student<00:01:46.040> teams<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.370> can<00:01:47.610> see

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
on Formula Student teams and I can see

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
on Formula Student teams and I can see
that<00:01:48.120> those<00:01:48.330> people<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:49.050> head<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:49.980> shoulders

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that those people are head and shoulders

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.660 
that those people are head and shoulders
above<00:01:51.080> those<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.010> haven't<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
above those that because you haven't and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
above those that because you haven't and
the<00:01:54.150> reason<00:01:54.480> they<00:01:54.600> hadn't<00:01:54.870> shoulders<00:01:55.230> above

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the reason they hadn't shoulders above

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.140 
the reason they hadn't shoulders above
them<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.550> challenges<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
them is that all of the challenges of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.530 
them is that all of the challenges of
Formula<00:01:57.510> Student<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:59.400> same<00:01:59.790> as<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.330> ones

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
Formula Student are the same as the ones

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
Formula Student are the same as the ones
that<00:02:00.660> we<00:02:00.930> face<00:02:01.230> in<00:02:01.530> Formula<00:02:01.950> One<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.820> they

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that we face in Formula One and so they

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.540 
that we face in Formula One and so they
get<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.180> head<00:02:03.450> start<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
get a head start in all the things that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.320 
get a head start in all the things that
are<00:02:05.640> necessary<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:08.970> also

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
are necessary to be a and I would also

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
are necessary to be a and I would also
go<00:02:10.110> further<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.619> say<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.009> they're<00:02:11.160> probably

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
go further to say that they're probably

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.240 
go further to say that they're probably
similar<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.510> challenges<00:02:13.110> faced<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.710> in

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
similar to the challenges faced in in

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.060 
similar to the challenges faced in in
engineering<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.300> general<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> lot<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.590> our

engineering in general for a lot of our
young<00:02:17.310> people<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.850> first<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.300> they've

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
young people it's the first time they've

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.080 
young people it's the first time they've
had<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> real<00:02:18.900> tangible<00:02:19.820> something<00:02:20.820> they've

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
had a real tangible something they've

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
had a real tangible something they've
really<00:02:21.420> had<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.750> create<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.140> they've<00:02:22.680> had<00:02:22.830> an

really had to create that they've had an

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.630 
really had to create that they've had an
academic<00:02:24.170> training<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.500> suddenly<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:26.550> an

challenge this this piece of metal they
have<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.110> create<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.830> off<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.130> compete

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
have to create and go off and compete

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.680 
have to create and go off and compete
with<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:34.190> that's<00:02:35.190> that's<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.210> bridge<00:02:36.480> you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
with and that's that's a bridge you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.360 
with and that's that's a bridge you
cross<00:02:36.960> at<00:02:37.170> some<00:02:37.350> point<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.770> your<00:02:37.800> career<00:02:38.100> of

cross at some point in your career of
going<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.820> theory<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.300> practice<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:40.020> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
going from theory to practice and this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
going from theory to practice and this
is<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> great<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.700> putting<00:02:41.940> into<00:02:42.450> practice

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
is a great way of putting into practice

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.620 
is a great way of putting into practice
all<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.980> theory<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.670> young<00:02:44.970> students<00:02:45.480> are

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
all the theory that I young students are

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.860 
all the theory that I young students are
young<00:02:45.870> engineers<00:02:46.350> are<00:02:46.530> learning<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:48.540> school

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
young engineers are learning at school

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.800 
young engineers are learning at school
and<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.230> college<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.570> wonderful

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and a college so it's a wonderful

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.790 
and a college so it's a wonderful
initiative<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.250> respect<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.800> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
initiative in that respect and it it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.700 
initiative in that respect and it it
gives<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.370> some<00:02:56.580> really<00:02:57.410> intense<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
gives them some really intense and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.580 
gives them some really intense and
fantastic<00:02:59.400> challenges<00:02:59.940> which<00:03:00.180> which<00:03:00.930> really

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
fantastic challenges which which really

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
fantastic challenges which which really
raises<00:03:01.860> their<00:03:02.340> levels<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.850> commitment<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
raises their levels of commitment and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.370 
raises their levels of commitment and
I've<00:03:03.600> been<00:03:03.810> around<00:03:03.990> some<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
I've been around some of the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.350 
I've been around some of the
universities<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.190> well<00:03:05.220> visiting<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.090> teams

and<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.780> professors<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.620> lecturers

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and the the the professors and lecturers

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.790 
and the the the professors and lecturers
are<00:03:11.790> involved<00:03:12.360> tell<00:03:12.990> me<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.260> had<00:03:13.350> never<00:03:13.560> seen

that<00:03:16.080> comes<00:03:16.830> from<00:03:17.040> their<00:03:17.220> students<00:03:17.610> when

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that comes from their students when

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.370 
that comes from their students when
they're<00:03:17.970> involved<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.510> these<00:03:18.630> projects<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
learned from former students so it's a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.350 
learned from former students so it's a
fantastic<00:03:45.800> catalyst<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.010> was<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.640> each<00:03:48.000> year

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
fantastic catalyst I was like each year

fantastic catalyst I was like each year
I<00:03:48.420> go<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.660> Silverstone<00:03:49.110> when

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
I go to Silverstone when

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.300 
I go to Silverstone when
when<00:03:49.930> they<00:03:50.050> have<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> big<00:03:50.470> meeting<00:03:50.830> there<00:03:51.070> and

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.979 
being in a Formula Student environment
that<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.220> clearly<00:04:15.550> very<00:04:15.880> mature<00:04:16.390> that's

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that is clearly very mature that's

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.410 
that is clearly very mature that's
benefited<00:04:17.709> as<00:04:17.890> we<00:04:18.130> do<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.549> Formula<00:04:18.940> One<00:04:19.120> from

benefited as we do in Formula One from
incremental<00:04:20.019> improvement<00:04:20.620> year-on-year<00:04:20.920> and

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
incremental improvement year-on-year and

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.720 
incremental improvement year-on-year and
they've<00:04:22.360> been<00:04:22.900> inheriting<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.010> efforts<00:04:24.490> of

if you talk to them they're just as

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.890 
if you talk to them they're just as
caught<00:04:53.950> up<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.460> there's<00:04:55.210> two<00:04:55.510> really

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
caught up in it there's two really

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.920 
caught up in it there's two really
innovative<00:04:56.440> forms<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:57.040> motorsport<00:04:57.430> left<00:04:57.940> that

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
innovative forms of motorsport left that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.390 
innovative forms of motorsport left that
my<00:04:59.020> window<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.380> one<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.680> them<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.919> former<00:05:00.250> one

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
my window and one of them is former one

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.800 
my window and one of them is former one
and<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.640> other<00:05:00.790> one<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.090> former<00:05:01.419> student

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and the other one is former student

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.890 
and the other one is former student
because<00:05:02.620> almost<00:05:02.950> all<00:05:03.190> other<00:05:03.400> forms<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:04.090> of

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
because almost all other forms of of

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.810 
because almost all other forms of of
motorsport<00:05:05.530> have<00:05:05.680> become<00:05:05.950> really<00:05:06.160> restricted

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
motorsport have become really restricted

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.159 
motorsport have become really restricted
by<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.000> regulations<00:05:07.660> they've<00:05:07.870> been<00:05:08.020> really

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
by the regulations they've been really

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.290 
by the regulations they've been really
put<00:05:08.440> into<00:05:08.710> tight<00:05:08.950> boxes<00:05:09.460> on<00:05:09.610> what<00:05:09.790> they<00:05:09.940> can<00:05:10.000> do

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
put into tight boxes on what they can do

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.120 
put into tight boxes on what they can do
and<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:11.169> great<00:05:11.350> thing<00:05:11.560> about<00:05:11.650> Formula

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
and the great thing about Formula

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.130 
and the great thing about Formula
Student<00:05:12.160> is<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.820> regulations<00:05:13.479> are<00:05:13.720> there<00:05:13.840> but

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
Student is the regulations are there but

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.860 
Student is the regulations are there but
they<00:05:14.350> they<00:05:15.280> reward<00:05:15.669> innovation<00:05:15.880> they're

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
they they reward innovation they're

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.400 
they they reward innovation they're
quite<00:05:17.200> broad<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:19.150> think<00:05:19.690> former<00:05:20.020> student

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
quite broad and I think former student

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.980 
quite broad and I think former student
is<00:05:20.530> one<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.100> most<00:05:21.850> exciting<00:05:22.270> forms<00:05:22.840> of

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
is one of the most exciting forms of

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.900 
is one of the most exciting forms of
motorsport<00:05:23.260> there<00:05:23.710> are<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:24.070> terms<00:05:24.760> of

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
motorsport there are in terms of

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.460 
motorsport there are in terms of
innovation<00:05:25.180> for<00:05:25.690> people<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.080> come<00:05:26.200> up<00:05:26.229> with

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
innovation for people to come up with

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.830 
innovation for people to come up with
ideas<00:05:26.700> when<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:27.790> look<00:05:28.000> at<00:05:28.150> all<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.419> those<00:05:28.510> cars

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
ideas when you look at all of those cars

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.300 
ideas when you look at all of those cars
they're<00:05:29.140> all<00:05:29.290> different<00:05:29.530> they've<00:05:29.919> all<00:05:30.070> found

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
they're all different they've all found

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.780 
they're all different they've all found
different<00:05:30.940> solutions<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.130> challenge<00:05:33.580> of

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
different solutions to the challenge of

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.030 
different solutions to the challenge of
competing<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:34.540> Formula<00:05:34.930> Student<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.470> there's

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
competing in Formula Student and there's

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.710 
competing in Formula Student and there's
not<00:05:36.160> one<00:05:36.430> car<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.790> looks<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> same<00:05:37.510> as<00:05:37.690> the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
not one car that looks the same as the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.930 
not one car that looks the same as the
other<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.260> I<00:05:38.830> think<00:05:38.890> that's<00:05:39.190> fascinating<00:05:39.400> I

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
other and I think that's fascinating I

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.719 
other and I think that's fascinating I
think<00:05:40.120> it's<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.300> great<00:05:41.010> aspect<00:05:42.010> of<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.310> success

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
think it's a great aspect of the success

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.540 
think it's a great aspect of the success
of<00:05:42.910> Formula<00:05:43.300> Student<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:44.280> don't<00:05:45.280> think<00:05:45.430> I've

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
of Formula Student I don't think I've

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.600 
of Formula Student I don't think I've
counted<00:05:45.820> up<00:05:46.180> exactly<00:05:46.840> how<00:05:47.050> many<00:05:47.610> recent

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
counted up exactly how many recent
