backdrop<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.080> finished<00:02:56.380> product

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
backdrop this is the finished product

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.410 
backdrop this is the finished product
you<00:02:57.100> want<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> make<00:02:57.850> sure<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.030> start<00:02:58.209> from<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
you want to make sure you start from the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.090 
you want to make sure you start from the
bottom<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.840> work<00:02:58.989> your<00:02:59.110> way<00:02:59.170> up<00:02:59.380> because<00:02:59.860> all

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
bottom and work your way up because all

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.520 
bottom and work your way up because all
of<00:03:00.130> these<00:03:00.430> are<00:03:00.730> layered<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:01.810> top<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
of these are layered one on top of the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.620 
of these are layered one on top of the
other<00:03:02.650> makes<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.519> really<00:03:03.670> easy<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.300> start

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
other makes it really easy if you start

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.140 
other makes it really easy if you start
backwards<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.920> that's<00:03:06.790> good<00:03:07.150> billon<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.780> line

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
backwards so that's good billon one line

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.970 
backwards so that's good billon one line
at<00:03:13.150> about<00:03:13.450> an<00:03:13.690> inch<00:03:13.930> maybe<00:03:14.470> inch<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> half

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
at about an inch maybe inch and a half

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.699 
at about an inch maybe inch and a half
up<00:03:15.690> now<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:16.959> have<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.140> use<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.350> glue<00:03:17.680> gun

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
up now you don't have to use a glue gun

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.890 
up now you don't have to use a glue gun
you<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.340> use<00:03:18.370> any<00:03:18.880> kind<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.209> permanent<00:03:19.570> glue

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
you can use any kind of permanent glue

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.330 
you can use any kind of permanent glue
you<00:03:20.170> want<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.040> need<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.220> make

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you want you just want to need to make

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.940 
you want you just want to need to make
sure<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.640> not<00:03:21.790> Elmer's<00:03:22.630> glue<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.230> you're

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
sure it's not Elmer's glue and you're

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.410 
sure it's not Elmer's glue and you're
going<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.340> stick<00:03:24.760> each<00:03:25.299> one

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.390 

I'm<00:03:31.420> moving<00:03:32.140> from<00:03:32.260> left<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.709> right<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> I'm

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I'm moving from left to right and I'm

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.250 
I'm moving from left to right and I'm
overlapping<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.180> circle<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.689> my<00:03:34.810> left<00:03:35.019> and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
overlapping the circle to my left and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.250 
overlapping the circle to my left and
also<00:03:35.680> each<00:03:35.980> circle<00:03:36.549> below<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.090> again<00:03:37.840> keep

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
also each circle below and again keep

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.750 
also each circle below and again keep
the<00:03:38.409> circles<00:03:38.769> lined<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.129> vertically<00:03:39.489> and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the circles lined up vertically and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.059 
the circles lined up vertically and
horizontally<00:03:39.939> for<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.689> best<00:03:40.870> effect<00:03:41.260> now<00:03:41.980> if

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
horizontally for the best effect now if

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.740 
horizontally for the best effect now if
you<00:03:42.159> can<00:03:42.280> see<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.579> one<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:42.909> an<00:03:43.030> example<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.689> a

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
you can see this one is an example of a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.690 
you can see this one is an example of a
circle<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.500> did<00:03:44.680> not<00:03:44.829> go<00:03:45.189> all<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.579> way

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
circle that did not go all the way

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.610 
circle that did not go all the way
around<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.450> cut<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:46.750> out<00:03:46.900> which<00:03:47.500> is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
around when I cut it out which is

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.899 
around when I cut it out which is
totally<00:03:47.920> fine<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.340> still<00:03:48.549> use<00:03:48.730> those

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
totally fine you can still use those

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.339 
totally fine you can still use those
just<00:03:48.970> make<00:03:49.299> sure<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.599> guy<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.810> at<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.109> top

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
just make sure this guy is at the top

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.229 
just make sure this guy is at the top
because<00:03:50.620> it'll<00:03:50.890> get<00:03:51.010> overlaid<00:03:51.670> on<00:03:51.939> the<00:03:52.030> next

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
because it'll get overlaid on the next

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.649 
because it'll get overlaid on the next
layer<00:03:52.409> moving<00:03:53.409> on<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.040> next<00:03:54.159> color<00:03:54.659> I'm

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
layer moving on to the next color I'm

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.470 
layer moving on to the next color I'm
using<00:03:55.720> five<00:03:56.260> different<00:03:56.290> shades<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.250> blue<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
using five different shades of blue the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.140 
using five different shades of blue the
bottom<00:03:58.930> two<00:03:59.349> colors<00:04:00.340> which<00:04:00.670> will<00:04:00.819> be<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
bottom two colors which will be the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.819 
bottom two colors which will be the
darkest<00:04:01.599> color<00:04:01.810> blue<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.470> glittery

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
darkest color blue in this glittery

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.920 
darkest color blue in this glittery
color<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.400> then<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.639> second<00:04:04.030> shade<00:04:04.239> those

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
color and then that second shade those

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.379 
color and then that second shade those
are<00:04:05.079> each<00:04:05.230> going<00:04:05.409> to<00:04:05.470> get<00:04:05.590> two<00:04:05.859> rows<00:04:06.069> then<00:04:06.909> the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
are each going to get two rows then the

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.300 
are each going to get two rows then the
two<00:04:07.599> middle<00:04:07.840> colors<00:04:08.260> are<00:04:08.500> going<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> get<00:04:08.829> one

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
two middle colors are going to get one

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.020 
two middle colors are going to get one
row<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:10.650> then<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.680> top<00:04:12.069> color<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.940> to

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
row and then the top color is going to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.129 
row and then the top color is going to
get<00:04:13.209> three<00:04:13.720> rows

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.719
