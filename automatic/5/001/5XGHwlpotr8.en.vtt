underneath cover these are always great

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
underneath cover these are always great
techniques<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.329> learn<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.110> learn<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> do

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
techniques to learn you learn how to do

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.990 
techniques to learn you learn how to do
these<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.250> help<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.550> hit<00:00:50.760> different

these it will help you hit different
angles<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.660> different<00:00:51.989> spots<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
angles in different spots that's the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
angles in different spots that's the
equivalent<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.969> driving<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> golfer

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
equivalent of driving if you're a golfer

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
equivalent of driving if you're a golfer
if<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.610> putting<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> use

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
if you're putting you need to use

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
if you're putting you need to use
clothes<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.530> casting<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
clothes in casting and for that we use a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
clothes in casting and for that we use a
technique<00:01:00.600> called<00:01:00.660> pitching<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.770> first

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
technique called pitching the first

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
technique called pitching the first
thing<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.000> debate<00:01:03.390> about<00:01:03.660> even

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
thing we do is we get debate about even

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
thing we do is we get debate about even
with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.350> real<00:01:04.619> handle<00:01:05.070> we're<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> go

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
with the real handle we're going to go

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.250 
with the real handle we're going to go
ahead<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.180> load<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.110> normally

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
ahead and load it just like we normally

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
ahead and load it just like we normally
would<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> roller<00:01:08.369> bearing<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.939> near<00:01:09.150> our

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
would get the roller bearing up near our

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
would get the roller bearing up near our
index<00:01:09.659> finger<00:01:09.780> open<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> bail<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> now

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
index finger open up the bail and now

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
index finger open up the bail and now
we're<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> grip<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> bait<00:01:13.140> above<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
we're going to grip the bait above the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.490 
we're going to grip the bait above the
bait<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> line<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.600> learn<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
bait on the line to learn how to do this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
bait on the line to learn how to do this
technique<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.280> we're<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> put

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
technique what we're going to do is put

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
accidentally let it go it'll drive that
hook<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.189> finger<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.240> hold<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hook into your finger so just hold it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
hook into your finger so just hold it
like<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> let<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> it'll<00:01:38.520> swing<00:01:38.820> away

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
like this let it go and it'll swing away

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
like this let it go and it'll swing away
from<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.680> push<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.159> out

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
from you we're not going to push it out

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
from you we're not going to push it out
like<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> use<00:01:42.840> our

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
like that we're not going to use our

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
like that we're not going to use our
arms<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.880> we're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
arms to get it out there what we're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
arms to get it out there what we're
going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.689> hold<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> rod<00:01:46.259> drop

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
going to do is just hold the rod drop

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
going to do is just hold the rod drop
the<00:01:47.220> bait<00:01:47.399> let<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.939> swing<00:01:48.210> away<00:01:48.390> once<00:01:49.200> we've

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the bait let it swing away once we've

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.010 
the bait let it swing away once we've
practiced<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> couple<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> times<00:01:51.020> then

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
practiced that a couple of times then

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
practiced that a couple of times then
we're<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> lower<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.430> rod<00:01:53.610> raise<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
we're going to lower the rod raise the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.350 
we're going to lower the rod raise the
rod<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.579> more<00:01:56.790> momentum

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
rod and now we have a lot more momentum

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
rod and now we have a lot more momentum
so<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.930> pitch<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.380> thing<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> lot

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so that we can pitch this thing a lot

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.609 
so that we can pitch this thing a lot
further<00:01:59.250> it's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.390> close<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.049> technique

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
further it's a very close in technique

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
further it's a very close in technique
so<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.159> we're<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.119> look

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
so all we're going to do is really look

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
so all we're going to do is really look
to<00:02:03.450> pick<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.079> close<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.560> target<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to pick a very close in target and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
to pick a very close in target and
release<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.090> let<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.290> we're

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
release it let it go and then we're

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
release it let it go and then we're
ready<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> pitch<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.670> again<00:02:08.970> lift<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> rod

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
ready to pitch so again lift up the rod

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.260 
ready to pitch so again lift up the rod
grab<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> line<00:02:10.709> lower<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.250> rod<00:02:11.430> lift<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> rod

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
grab the line lower the rod lift the rod

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.900 
grab the line lower the rod lift the rod
