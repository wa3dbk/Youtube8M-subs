my setups and i'll let you know how it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
my setups and i'll let you know how it
performs<00:00:48.090> okay<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.110> before<00:00:49.350> i<00:00:49.559> start<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
performs okay so before i start this is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
performs okay so before i start this is
the<00:00:50.219> setup<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.640> i'll<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.910> using<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.420> my

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the setup that i'll be using it's my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650 
the setup that i'll be using it's my
home<00:00:51.840> 1m<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:52.710> 2009<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.239> wheels

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
home 1m for from 2009 the wheels

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.500 
home 1m for from 2009 the wheels
actually<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.920> clear<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.879> angle<00:00:57.270> because

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
actually they clear at an angle because

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.700 
actually they clear at an angle because
the<00:00:57.629> trucks<00:00:57.840> aren't<00:00:58.079> exactly<00:00:58.440> straight

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the trucks aren't exactly straight

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
the trucks aren't exactly straight
anymore<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.430> bushings<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.000> about

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
anymore because these bushings are about

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
anymore because these bushings are about
two<00:01:00.600> years<00:01:00.750> old<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.100> screwed<00:01:02.370> up

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
two years old and then really screwed up

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
two years old and then really screwed up
and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> axles<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> fall<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:04.439> so

i'm a huge fan of the bearing wheels
from<00:01:55.649> flat<00:01:55.890> face<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:57.200> i<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.619> highly

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
from flat face but i would highly

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
from flat face but i would highly
recommend<00:01:59.159> these<00:01:59.820> bearings<00:02:00.270> wheels<00:02:00.570> if

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
recommend these bearings wheels if

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.749 
recommend these bearings wheels if
you're<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> tighter<00:02:01.290> budget<00:02:01.460> they're<00:02:02.460> much

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you're on a tighter budget they're much

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.340 
you're on a tighter budget they're much
smoother<00:02:03.240> than<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> stock<00:02:03.689> tech<00:02:03.990> deck<00:02:04.140> wheels

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
smoother than the stock tech deck wheels

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280 
smoother than the stock tech deck wheels
that<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> find<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.020> trucks

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
are i believe they're china trucks

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.450 
are i believe they're china trucks
they're<00:02:09.229> just<00:02:09.259> wide<00:02:09.680> trucks<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.250> made

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460

they're just wide trucks that are made
they<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.360> tech<00:02:11.570> deck<00:02:11.750> trucks<00:02:11.990> they're

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
they not tech deck trucks they're

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.800 
they not tech deck trucks they're
slightly<00:02:12.470> better<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.270> bushings<00:02:14.720> are

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
