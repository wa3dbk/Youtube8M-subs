00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
diamond pick which is about stupid but

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.120 
diamond pick which is about stupid but
whatever<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.850> break<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.740> say<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
whatever so if I break these to say and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.380 
whatever so if I break these to say and
then<00:01:44.729> put<00:01:45.090> rock<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.970> put<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then put rock here and then I put this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.560 
then put rock here and then I put this
down<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.950> ban<00:01:50.130> its<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.579> okay<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
down then will ban its right okay so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.800 
down then will ban its right okay so
then<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.290> try<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> break<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
then if I try to do this break that and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
then if I try to do this break that and
then<00:01:55.140> break<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:57.799> right<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.979> guess<00:01:59.219> it's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
then break these up right I guess it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
then break these up right I guess it's
okay<00:01:59.759> i'm<00:02:00.420> gonna<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> break<00:02:00.780> another<00:02:01.020> one

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
um there we go as soon as I do that it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
um there we go as soon as I do that it
