particles out see I'm holding the garden

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.030 
particles out see I'm holding the garden
hose<00:03:29.120> straight<00:03:29.450> up<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.989> not<00:03:30.650> really

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
hose straight up to it not really

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.640 
hose straight up to it not really
touching<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:31.989> just<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.109> make<00:03:33.290> sure<00:03:33.470> that

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
water gets all the way through that

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.550 
water gets all the way through that
filter<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.450> pushes<00:03:35.780> out<00:03:35.959> anything<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.470> may

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560

filter it pushes out anything that may
be<00:03:36.590> clogged<00:03:36.980> up<00:03:37.190> on<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.459> back<00:03:37.669> side

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:59.110 

all<00:03:48.060> right

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.430 

let's<00:04:00.120> take<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> look<00:04:00.630> at<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.960> here<00:04:01.080> that's<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
let's take a look at it here that's the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.250 
let's take a look at it here that's the
backside<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:01.950> course<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:03.540> side<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.960> do<00:04:04.080> have

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
backside of course this side is do have

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.660 
backside of course this side is do have
some<00:04:04.440> particles<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:04.980> are<00:04:05.040> still<00:04:05.340> kind<00:04:05.520> of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
some particles that are still kind of

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.810 
some particles that are still kind of
trapped<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.180> there<00:04:06.420> try<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.350> hold<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.820> fin

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
trapped in there try to hold that fin

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.230 
trapped in there try to hold that fin
open<00:04:09.240> there<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.660> try<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.960> those<00:04:10.110> out<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:40.200 

little<00:04:15.240> high-pressure<00:04:16.020> here

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.270 

all<00:04:40.960> right<00:04:41.199> just<00:04:41.470> give<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.650> another<00:04:41.830> good<00:04:42.039> soak

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
all right just give it another good soak

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.700 
all right just give it another good soak
down<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.699> side<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.259> just<00:04:44.380> got<00:04:44.560> about

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
down on this side so you just got about

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.730 
down on this side so you just got about
all<00:04:44.919> those<00:04:45.070> particles<00:04:45.430> out<00:04:45.759> of<00:04:45.789> there<00:04:49.740> all

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
all those particles out of there all

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.360 
all those particles out of there all
right<00:04:50.919> now<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.580> next<00:04:51.970> step<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:53.310> find<00:04:54.310> a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
right now the next step is a find a

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.010 
right now the next step is a find a
place<00:04:54.639> nice<00:04:54.940> in<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.240> Sun<00:04:55.509> or<00:04:55.690> something<00:04:55.960> like

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
place nice in the Sun or something like

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.879 
place nice in the Sun or something like
that<00:04:56.320> just<00:04:56.500> let<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.610> dry<00:04:57.850> pretty<00:04:58.150> good<00:04:58.800> set<00:04:59.800> it

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
that just let it dry pretty good set it

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.140 
that just let it dry pretty good set it
right<00:04:59.979> here<00:05:00.130> on<00:05:00.220> top<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.520> garbage<00:05:00.910> can

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
right here on top of this garbage can

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.420 
right here on top of this garbage can
just<00:05:01.419> let<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.600> dry<00:05:01.900> out<00:05:02.070> it'll<00:05:03.070> take<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.370> a

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
just let it dry out it'll take it a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.909 
just let it dry out it'll take it a
little<00:05:03.520> bit<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.289> once<00:05:05.289> we<00:05:05.380> dry<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.620> out<00:05:05.770> we'll

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
little bit and once we dry it out we'll

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.270 
little bit and once we dry it out we'll
be<00:05:05.949> able<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.190> spray<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.610> new<00:05:07.479> oil<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.139> and

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
be able to spray the new oil on it and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.680 
be able to spray the new oil on it and
be<00:05:09.280> able<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.490> back<00:05:09.639> you<00:05:10.120> know<00:05:10.210> install<00:05:10.509> it<00:05:10.600> back

alright everybody got the air filter

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.680 
alright everybody got the air filter
here<00:05:16.060> all<00:05:16.210> dried<00:05:16.570> out<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:19.000> can<00:05:19.180> see<00:05:19.419> as
