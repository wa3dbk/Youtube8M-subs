00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good to all your button so handsome 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
 this same newspaper is here as you are 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.839
 watching I'm looking to start from multi team and I 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.760
 I find a private room that none 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 of you would stay imagine me all 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.000
 prestige teachers all with the design 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.460
 of plans 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 It looks like a prono and good here 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.270
 with two with two noses we are left to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.949
 see how it was not and well 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.420
 you know that many of the others ask me 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 you always have no fear of a game 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 against people who are good and that's not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
 against bad people of serve you find 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.769
 you always good the truth is that already 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 You see now why I do not know 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.740
 You can pay attention to this so 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 water and with the superman dodge eta or 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 abyss and almost anyone gets nuclear 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 and ximo apps and everything and good I'm seeing 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 here a new english amps map 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 you see playstation 3 has come out today and well 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 see us demonstrate now because they are going 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 I always get the wizard and good and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.190
 Now I'm going to get the pin and pay attention 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.190
 in the reaction my partner has 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.210
 and good as you are seeing there that is your 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.920
 reaction in nothing else start in less than 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 one minute I think and well I'm out 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 us that of the pem and everything and good as 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 You see it almost 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 two people are left on the slab 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.860
 do anything against people who are more or 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 less good at the moment when 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 you start throwing the gusts as they leave 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 all and you can not good you can get out 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.079
 things against them basically because of that or 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 basically also because they're going to 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.439
 end up killing not if you go against 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.030
 because they have so to say more 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.619
 skill that people do not kill the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.780
 people who do not have as much talk playing 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 so well you are already seeing shot of the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 penis bone and they are pulled from the game 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.360
 we were against two and good sprint 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 I put now some small for a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.079
 paragraph because you know how there was only 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 two people because it was harder to kill 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 it's harder to find them and that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.539
 pay attention to this respawn that makes me 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.209
 I did not know that this was the case in 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.640
 this in this game not in this one good in 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.560
 this new map did not know what to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 I could do a pound trapping there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.270
 Quickly he was late for a person 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.709
 torsos twice quickly and not good 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.970
 as I'm seeing is using the in 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.649
 the diamond present you already know that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 have a fuse obviously in 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.110
 this account also I have then the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.450
 rocket launcher I also have the cards and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 I do not know if I have anything else that the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590
 shotgun is not the case is that I'll finish 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.660
 taking everything out just like you're seeing already 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 inexorable streak and good as it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
 I was saying they have already left 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.890
 the new dlc the new map pack of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.270
 crisis of costs and that and good had 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.580
 thought maybe a detail in 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.080
 plan to take out clips all day long from 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.850
 today and then do a montage and upload it to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 the night but one was seeing that it was 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.660
 practically impossible more than anything 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.090
 because I did not have a group of 9 for good 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.520
 well to be able to do these things and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.700
 well I could not get the 20 too 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.900
 because I started to play and practically 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.450
 you do not meet people quickly 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 to make a chain of casualties or what 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.770
 let it be a little room or something like that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.240
 I do not like these maps for that and I 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.030
 I say from the beginning that the map of 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.470
 magma is a waste but in general the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.050
 maps are pretty good this map 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.730
 above all and the map also of good 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.610
 for study which is basically 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.870
 fighting range of good from bracons 1 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.580
 They are quite good and I know 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.620
 I recommend that you buy it if you do not 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.720
 you still have this dlc because it is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.130
 quite well and also has the zombies 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 and that sure that many like 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.900
 make the project more improved and I do not know 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.310
 what will you die of those that are great 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.050
 You already know that I do not know much 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.820
 of that and well you are already seeing this is 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.050
 the last couple's cutie even though you have 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.030
 already this is 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.620
 the last streak of the nuclear as 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.600
 I'm seeing the enemies, according to 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.430
 they were entering some were also 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200
 quite a lot of benefits so to speak 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.280
 in plan that form the goal that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.380
 they went all the time 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.970
 well then expand the points and such 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.250
 well you were in had been quite 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.080
 entertaining the nuclear is not a nuclear 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.300
 in shocks in two minutes that you do 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.530
 well quickly but one is what I could 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.480
 have is because you know I do not depend 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.280
 of the people who are piling up from the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 games I do not know if it will be the first 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.890
 nuclear 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.349
 good on youtube and that of this new dlc 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.890
 in playstation3 because the truth is 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.780
 cost 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.150
 as I am not commenting on this video 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.430
 there was no impression 3 his life to 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.930
 less than Spaniards I've seen one of a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.550
 guiri and that you are seeing, you have to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.560
 they unite again the students who 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.239
 good that already in receiving again but 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.489
 nothing according to what goes in, sure it's going 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.170
 but I'm tired of those of the pm 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.300
 these are always touching the noses 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 I do not know about you and it bothers you, we're going to 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.360
 me at the moment they start me 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.340
 stretch this spin and it starts me 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.860
 trolle also the command that if they give 11 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.049
 4 that they invent it well I went and I 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.970
 they throw the pm and on top I lie here 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.350
 it bothers me the command is also that no 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.120
 I know I do not know if it will happen to you 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
 but they say when the command starts you 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.210
 bullfight but one is already when you 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.669
 you find this come here and you 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.460
 you take the nuclear with mp7 nothing more 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.389
 start not love love ever so 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.040
 that good 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.560
 I have not told you that also 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.450
 I have good that this game itself is 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.070
 a nuclear double in equipment since another 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.900
 partner of which we are here about 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.910
 subscribers that I found out there by 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.520
 a previous room or a game and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.350
 then invite them also to nuclear as well 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.580
 how good you have here your nuclear I hope 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.300
 that you liked above all to vote the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.370
 video 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.080
 a lot and especially because it's one of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.120
 the first nuclear in playstation 3 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.960
 but the first on youtube so nothing 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.960
 I hope it is liked 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.240
 when you wait for the fish
