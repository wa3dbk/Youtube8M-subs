00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone guys I'm back with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
 This news takes us from top to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.030
 episode 16 to start I have to tell you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 a very important thing that is to say 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.820
 some strange reason the module that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.860
 use to see the big ones 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 sent has decided well to unsubscribe 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 all the clips from August 27th onwards 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 so for those who sent the slip 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
 from August 27 onwards the scope a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.580
 postpone it otherwise you won't be able to see them 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 in the top I as a councilor of myself 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.910
 remember not to distract you in your case 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 clip will not be present these tops too 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 because since I have to do four tops 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 below in about an hour I started 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 take very old so maybe for 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 those who haven't seen it for a long time could 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 find in this and remind you that if 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.690
 you want to send me the clips you have to go to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 linkedin selection however I would say that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.800
 you can immediately start with this top 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.530
 five in fifth place we find dami 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.410
 killer 2 that lead us to quintuple col 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 c4 on nuketown sides evident as 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.530
 cottage fame so I don't know what 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.879
 they were doing cellophane what to see 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 anyway guys how you see the clip 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 registered with the mobile 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 I kept it because you can see it anyway 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 lowered well however try to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 register it with the cinema there is the option from the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 black ops 2 cinema and useless that you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.020
 has clips loaded directly onto 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 youtube look for trajectories to the up 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 youtube there are 10 thousand anyway 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 we are already at the fourth clip that was there 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.950
 time woods 75 and it brings us not one but 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 but two akros three maps in the same one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 game 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 I don't remember whether with the funny ones all 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 two or with the tone however here is the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 first let us see it is on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.560
 standoff eluded the lance guarantees below 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 an how can you see this war there? 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.799
 spawn 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.090
 and here instead exposes another say and does 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.890
 I particularly liked it later 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.240
 first of all because they are not two 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 same games must have an ass 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.060
 as big as a house 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.310
 but then why doesn't the start where 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 however, you simply need to know 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.200
 sport but does it during the beat a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 cause for in people however 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.479
 let's go straight to the third position 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.329
 brings it to us 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.070
 hicks life that brings us a 5 mansfield 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.840
 with the remington on new town 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.490
 wapa also a random jump shot goes 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 well, some others, anyway 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.799
 also seen the br to pass immediately to the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.770
 second that there is the door around and that there 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.050
 brings a very fast ace on the alloy for 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.330
 who did not know what 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.300
 unites a full team as they call it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 many technical term would be just the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.930
 very fast with the m8 on mel from a 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.300
 obviously uncertain it is not a club because 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.070
 there was the soldier still alive, however 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.590
 he made out 4 as you see here not there 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.780
 he took three and knows that there is one there and it 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.780
 it takes perfect to say that to pass 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.830
 immediately to the first clip that there is the door 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.040
 safe devil and brings us a trick shot on 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.540
 red tv made so much not just because 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 maybe in another one after the very first one 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 previous position but this as it is 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.400
 liked not ask me why anyway 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 I think it's a good clip and or east 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.960
 heaven to revise to torment inc 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.850
 cam and is called safe partisans 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.990
 having said it anyway 48 and finished vi 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.580
 I remember as usual that if you want 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.440
 send me repeated sees pass long 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.960
 descriptions remember there was a nice me 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.860
 like at home by rats like it 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.480
 commented you write there have been 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.810
 still in three boys I finished bye 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.810
 all
