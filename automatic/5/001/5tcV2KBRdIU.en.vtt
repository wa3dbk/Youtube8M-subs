00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
before they even get the one coming back

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.140 
before they even get the one coming back
which<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.340> mean<00:03:26.460> they<00:03:26.550> have<00:03:26.700> your<00:03:26.850> credit<00:03:27.120> card

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
which I mean they have your credit card

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.940 
which I mean they have your credit card
stuff<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.750> guess<00:03:27.960> they<00:03:28.140> figure<00:03:28.470> they<00:03:28.740> can't

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
stuff so I guess they figure they can't

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.020 
stuff so I guess they figure they can't
lose<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:32.220> yesterday<00:03:32.900> yesterday

hhgregg and i liked them but but Jon and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.240 
hhgregg and i liked them but but Jon and
I<00:03:51.240> both<00:03:51.270> did<00:03:51.990> not<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.770> they<00:03:52.950> fit<00:03:53.220> me

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I both did not think that they fit me

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.490 
I both did not think that they fit me
very<00:03:53.370> well<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.300> thing<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.780> think<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.290> lot

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
very well for one thing I think it a lot

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.080 
very well for one thing I think it a lot
of<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.920> I'm<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.430> not<00:03:56.580> used<00:03:56.640> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
of it is that I'm just not used to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.290 
of it is that I'm just not used to
wearing<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.750> flat<00:03:58.020> boot<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.130> felt<00:03:59.880> really

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
wearing a flat boot so I felt really

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.360 
wearing a flat boot so I felt really
weird<00:04:00.630> with<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.620> kind<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.130> flatter

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
weird with that just kind of a flatter

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.730 
weird with that just kind of a flatter
heel<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.940> they<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.930> bunched<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.530> like

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
heel and they really bunched up like

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.160 
heel and they really bunched up like
around<00:04:04.860> my<00:04:05.100> ankle<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.820> think<00:04:06.540> maybe<00:04:06.690> my<00:04:06.810> legs

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
around my ankle I think maybe my legs

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.970 
around my ankle I think maybe my legs
aren't<00:04:07.380> long<00:04:07.470> enough<00:04:07.620> I'm<00:04:08.570> 56<00:04:09.570> but<00:04:10.170> most<00:04:10.770> of<00:04:10.950> my

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
aren't long enough I'm 56 but most of my

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.660 
aren't long enough I'm 56 but most of my
height<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.730> my<00:04:11.880> upper<00:04:12.180> body<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:13.070> so<00:04:14.070> bottom

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
height is in my upper body and so bottom

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.370 
height is in my upper body and so bottom
line<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.330> decided<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.870> go<00:04:15.959> ahead<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.200> send
