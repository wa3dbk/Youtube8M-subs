have optical here for digital and if you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760 
have optical here for digital and if you
have<00:02:02.250> an<00:02:02.340> old-school<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.770> RCA

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
have an old-school one we have RCA

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
have an old-school one we have RCA
connectors<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.549> connect<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.380> audio<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
connectors here to connect to audio that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.410 
connectors here to connect to audio that
way<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> power<00:02:08.819> connector<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
way let's have the power connector here

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
way let's have the power connector here
the<00:02:09.899> power<00:02:10.200> brick<00:02:10.349> connects<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.340> then

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the power brick connects here and then

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
the power brick connects here and then
we<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.300> USB<00:02:12.750> ports<00:02:13.080> over<00:02:13.620> on

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
we have two USB ports over on

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
we have two USB ports over on
side<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.970> allow<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> connect

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
side here and that allow you to connect

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
side here and that allow you to connect
a<00:02:15.810> lot<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.110> different<00:02:16.410> things<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.890> in

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a lot of different things this is in

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.150 
a lot of different things this is in
fact<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.430> full<00:02:17.730> operating<00:02:18.600> Linux<00:02:19.290> box<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.130> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
fact a full operating Linux box so you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
fact a full operating Linux box so you
can<00:02:20.250> connect<00:02:20.640> things<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.120> mouse<00:02:21.420> keyboards

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
can connect things like mouse keyboards

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
can connect things like mouse keyboards
and<00:02:22.470> external<00:02:23.100> hard<00:02:23.280> drive<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.880> can

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and external hard drive so that you can

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.190 
and external hard drive so that you can
actually<00:02:24.120> stream<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.540> content<00:02:24.960> directly

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
actually stream your content directly

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.760 
actually stream your content directly
from<00:02:25.440> those<00:02:25.770> hard<00:02:26.100> drives<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
from those hard drives because this is

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.050 
from those hard drives because this is
going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.010> connected<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.490> your<00:02:29.580> TV<00:02:29.610> but

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
going to be connected to your TV but

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.920 
going to be connected to your TV but
you're<00:02:30.150> probably<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.630> across<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you're probably going to be across the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.870 
you're probably going to be across the
room<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.500> couch<00:02:31.770> loafing<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.580> eating<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
room on the couch loafing and eating a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.970 
room on the couch loafing and eating a
bunch<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.120> chips<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> remote

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
bunch of chips we actually have a remote

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.020 
bunch of chips we actually have a remote
control<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.880> actually

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
control here that you can actually

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.760 
control here that you can actually
connect<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:36.990> control<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> boxee

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
connect to to it and control the boxee

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.070 
connect to to it and control the boxee
box<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> tilt<00:02:39.540> pedal<00:02:39.810> around<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
box so we have a tilt pedal around the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.860 
box so we have a tilt pedal around the
outside<00:02:40.380> left<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.520> down<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> can

content<00:04:33.760> from<00:04:34.210> outside<00:04:34.600> on<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.840> web<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.200> I

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
content from outside on the web but I

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.350 
content from outside on the web but I
guess<00:04:36.100> because<00:04:36.280> this<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.670> a<00:04:36.700> Linux<00:04:37.000> box<00:04:37.150> you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
guess because this is a Linux box you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.910 
guess because this is a Linux box you
could<00:04:37.540> have<00:04:37.720> other<00:04:37.870> things<00:04:38.200> coming<00:04:38.770> through

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
could have other things coming through

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.860 
could have other things coming through
these<00:04:39.070> apps<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:40.150> get<00:04:40.300> them<00:04:40.480> through<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
these apps you get them through the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.420 
these apps you get them through the
interface<00:04:41.230> you<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:41.620> do<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.770> search<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.340> on

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430

the<00:04:42.550> box<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.850> interface<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.420> also<00:04:43.540> have

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the box the interface but you also have

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.540 
the box the interface but you also have
the<00:04:43.840> ability<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.140> look<00:04:44.350> in<00:04:44.560> repositories<00:04:44.920> so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
the ability to look in repositories so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.460 
the ability to look in repositories so
