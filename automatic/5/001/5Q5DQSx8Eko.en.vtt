00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.440
 people who are telling you their 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.809
 dreams to others 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.809
 know the dreams of life 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.740
 because they do not make sense and I think that 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.720
 that's part of the definition of a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.090
 dream there is no narrative thread no thread 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.640
 driver there is no sequence in the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.869
 images to say is it's absurd when 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.600
 was in the note has a partner 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.830
 that he had this compulsive need for 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.180
 get to every day at the time of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.360
 lunch tell us the dream of the night 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.360
 previous 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.120
 first of all we are having lunch 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.420
 the magazines with the best test 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.600
 psychiatric that you already already know I 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.600
 I lose it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.789
 a pleasure 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.680
 time would be the safe interpretation of 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.510
 any psychologist if you're supposed to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.269
 we are all obsessed with sex 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.820
 to our rights have dreams 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.820
 rare the strange things that one represses 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.790
 and today he has come to a conclusion 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 I now said I now lie down 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.549
 from here it's not worth it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.359
 until anything because sometimes 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.359
 You will see this book as 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.140
 or not 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.780
 to you it does not happen for example when 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.270
 one like when you have a dream like 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 horribly sexual with someone to whom 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.679
 know but nothing to see 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.579
 and then it's time to see them the next day 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.000
 a list without like of the curious ones to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.000
 Girls 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.540
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.650
 and then you have to ask for a report 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.720
 counted good morning and see how dawned 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.720
 be here tonight 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 very alive 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.920
 I have a recurring dream with day 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:20.120
 Florida 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.120
 for not like that for God's sake not easy 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.709
 both name is a pretty dream 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 respect is to say a not like that is a dream 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.970
 those dreams nuances up bored of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.299
 tell that absolutely nothing happens 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.879
 simply that stable and I put 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.280
 we put baking and it's always 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.250
 exactly the same we are doing a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.790
 banana bread and it always happens that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.769
 We have all the balance and pound 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.840
 and we already have all the mass ready with 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.420
 parents we are about to put him 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.040
 oven and that opens a door that 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.409
 the kitchen extends a white light 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.739
 incandescent and who appears inÃ©s 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.659
 sanchez de frequent in robe and curlers 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.409
 as a community of transistors that touch 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.409
 the song from the club 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.700
 and we begin to approach and get angry 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.700
 that satan 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.630
 [Music] 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.980
 rips off the apron and the apprentice's 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440
 pant has hidden a poplar but 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.390
 our baby took it out in the post 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.230
 straight to the head the hair tip 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.230
 they do not know what is immortal 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.970
 he has it here to sign me and I authorize you 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.970
 for God's sake keep your composure 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.020
 florist's menchov a squirt of cornstarch 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.569
 of those who are open another door in 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.740
 that corner the kitchen white light 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.790
 incandescent and who knows bryant gray-haired 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.980
 [Music] 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.720
 with a flight order 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.720
 saying who wants talent 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.250
