00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.490 
instead of you do a single track single
track<00:03:36.230> 11<00:03:36.500> 11<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:38.030> they<00:03:38.510> put<00:03:38.870> one<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.410> then

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
track 11 11 then they put one and then

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.440 
track 11 11 then they put one and then
they<00:03:39.590> double<00:03:40.040> over<00:03:40.400> then<00:03:40.970> they<00:03:41.060> do<00:03:41.210> another

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
they double over then they do another

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.330 
they double over then they do another
one<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:41.780> basically<00:03:42.500> double<00:03:42.890> tracking<00:03:43.100> means

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
one so basically double tracking means

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.160 
one so basically double tracking means
