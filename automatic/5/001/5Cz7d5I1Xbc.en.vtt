00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
out I'm October was a little hard just
because<00:00:31.470> well<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:32.820> October<00:00:33.510> has

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because well first of all October has

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.959 
because well first of all October has
two<00:00:33.899> birthstones<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> opal<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.790> i

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
two birthstones one is opal which i

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.819 
two birthstones one is opal which i
believe<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> stat<00:00:37.020> burstyn<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
believe is like the stat burstyn for the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
believe is like the stat burstyn for the
month<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> October<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.910> there's<00:00:39.059> also<00:00:39.239> pink

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
month of October but there's also pink

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
month of October but there's also pink
tourmaline<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> another<00:00:40.559> option<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
tourmaline which is another option so I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
tourmaline which is another option so I
had<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> pick<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> wanted<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> do

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
had to pick which one I wanted to do

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
had to pick which one I wanted to do
part<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> me<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.710> wanted<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> pink

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
part of me really wanted to do the pink

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
part of me really wanted to do the pink
tourmaline<00:00:45.559> simply<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.219> pink<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
tourmaline simply because it was pink it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
tourmaline simply because it was pink it
was<00:00:47.760> narrowed<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.480> shade<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
was narrowed down to one shade and it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.520 
was narrowed down to one shade and it
would<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.530> easier<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.280> turn<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> tutorial

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
would be easier to turn into a tutorial

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
would be easier to turn into a tutorial
but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.770> already<00:00:52.920> done<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> pink<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
but I already done a pink look and I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.180 
but I already done a pink look and I
really<00:00:54.930> wanted<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> challenge<00:00:55.530> myself<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.039> do

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
really wanted to challenge myself and do

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
really wanted to challenge myself and do
something<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.610> I've<00:00:56.699> never<00:00:56.969> worn<00:00:57.390> before<00:00:57.770> so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
something that I've never worn before so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
something that I've never worn before so
I<00:00:58.800> decided<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.520> oh<00:00:59.699> wat<00:01:00.059> scared<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.660> was

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I decided to do oh wat scared as I was

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.070 
I decided to do oh wat scared as I was
so<00:01:01.620> opals<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.359> unique

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so opals actually really is very unique

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
so opals actually really is very unique
person<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.920> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> complicated<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
person but it's kind of complicated to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
person but it's kind of complicated to
turn<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.360> tutorial<00:01:06.990> simply<00:01:07.860> because

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
turn it into tutorial simply because

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.730 
turn it into tutorial simply because
opals<00:01:08.670> unlike<00:01:09.030> sapphire<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.020> normally

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
opals unlike sapphire which is normally

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.310 
opals unlike sapphire which is normally
blue<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.310> amethyst<00:01:11.880> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> usually<00:01:12.930> purple

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
blue or amethyst which is usually purple

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
blue or amethyst which is usually purple
you<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.310> can't<00:01:14.610> pin<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you really can't pin it down to one

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.350 
you really can't pin it down to one
particular<00:01:16.080> shade<00:01:16.650> opals<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.549> found<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
particular shade opals are found in a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
particular shade opals are found in a
variety<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.229> colors<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.890> orange<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> green

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to blue to golds to pinks pretty much

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929 
to blue to golds to pinks pretty much
everything<00:01:25.080> most<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.250> opals<00:01:26.759> are

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
everything most of time opals are

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.510 
everything most of time opals are
transparent<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.710> tend<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.430> an

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
transparent they just tend to be like an

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
transparent they just tend to be like an
iridescent<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.360> pearly<00:01:30.930> white<00:01:31.170> shade<00:01:31.670> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
iridescent at pearly white shade but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640 
iridescent at pearly white shade but
when<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.200> what

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
when you first look at them that's what

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
when you first look at them that's what
they<00:01:34.829> appear<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> look

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
they appear to be but if you look

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
they appear to be but if you look
closely<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.290> actually<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.189> they

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
closely you actually see that they

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300 
closely you actually see that they
reflect<00:01:39.210> many<00:01:39.689> different<00:01:40.049> colors<00:01:40.310> opals

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
reflect many different colors opals

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.069 
reflect many different colors opals
usually<00:01:41.700> reflect<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> colors<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:42.869> them

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
usually reflect the colors around them

shadow<00:03:33.770> pencil<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.220> milk<00:03:34.459> which<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> mat

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
shadow pencil and milk which is the mat

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
like stark white one and I just applied

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.729 
like stark white one and I just applied
this<00:03:37.760> wherever<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.330> put<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.720> primer<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.500> use

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
this wherever I put the primer and I use

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.199 
this wherever I put the primer and I use
this<00:03:40.010> because<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> lot<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.790> shades<00:03:41.060> i'm

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
this because a lot of the shades i'm

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.210 
this because a lot of the shades i'm
using<00:03:41.510> are<00:03:41.630> very<00:03:41.810> light<00:03:42.080> very<00:03:42.290> pastel<00:03:42.890> shades

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
using are very light very pastel shades

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.800 
using are very light very pastel shades
and<00:03:43.520> sometimes<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.180> be<00:03:44.209> kind<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.570> hard<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and sometimes it can be kind of hard to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.960 
and sometimes it can be kind of hard to
get<00:03:44.959> those<00:03:45.050> actually<00:03:45.530> show<00:03:45.739> up<00:03:45.770> but<00:03:46.610> if<00:03:46.850> you

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
get those actually show up but if you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.030 
get those actually show up but if you
put<00:03:47.120> down<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.420> white<00:03:47.690> base<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.350> will<00:03:48.890> enhance

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
put down a white base it will enhance

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.260 
put down a white base it will enhance
the<00:03:49.280> colors<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:49.790> make<00:03:49.880> them<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.060> lot<00:03:50.209> more

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
the colors and make them a lot more

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.090 
the colors and make them a lot more
vibrant<00:03:50.780> than<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.959> would<00:03:51.110> be<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:51.920> their

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
vibrant than they would be just on their

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.190 
vibrant than they would be just on their

own so I put that on and made sure to
blend<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.620> out<00:03:54.880> then<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.910> use<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.959> fancy<00:03:57.350> tool

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180

light<00:06:30.450> and<00:06:30.930> I<00:06:31.020> didn't<00:06:31.320> want<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.620> appear<00:06:31.710> too

washed<00:06:32.460> out<00:06:32.760> with<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:33.120> pastel<00:06:33.660> eyes<00:06:33.870> but<00:06:34.440> I

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
washed out with the pastel eyes but I

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.870 
washed out with the pastel eyes but I
didn't<00:06:34.800> want<00:06:34.950> anything<00:06:35.130> that<00:06:35.400> would<00:06:35.580> take

away<00:06:35.910> from<00:06:36.330> the<00:06:36.450> eyes<00:06:36.570> because<00:06:36.840> they<00:06:36.930> are<00:06:37.080> very

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110
