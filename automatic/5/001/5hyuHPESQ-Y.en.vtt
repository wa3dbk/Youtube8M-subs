the software review things are very
snappy<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.890> works<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.489> quickly<00:00:50.840> hardly<00:00:51.840> any

we<00:00:56.910> covered<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.539> software<00:00:58.039> tour<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
we covered that in the software tour a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
we covered that in the software tour a
little<00:00:59.879> closer<00:01:00.090> look<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.859> gsm

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
little closer look there it's got gsm

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.690 
little closer look there it's got gsm
it's<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> high<00:01:03.780> bandwidth<00:01:04.700> capabilities

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's got the high bandwidth capabilities

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
it's got the high bandwidth capabilities
there<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.350> hspa+<00:01:07.549> will<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
there is the hspa+ will go down here to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.800 
there is the hspa+ will go down here to
speed<00:01:09.299> tests<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> our<00:01:11.810> results

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
speed tests show you some of our results

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.969 
speed tests show you some of our results
here<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.710> got<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here so as you can see here we got up to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
here so as you can see here we got up to
56<00:01:17.490> 90<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.540> dropped<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:18.960> into

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
56 90 here and then I dropped down into

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.670 
56 90 here and then I dropped down into
some<00:01:19.439> lower<00:01:19.619> speeds<00:01:20.900> with<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
some lower speeds with the that was the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.760 
some lower speeds with the that was the
up<00:01:22.799> 14<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:24.380> 522<00:01:25.939> down<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> 722<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.259> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
up 14 down 522 down and 722 up and then

up 14 down 522 down and 722 up and then
the<00:01:29.700> lower<00:01:29.880> end<00:01:30.150> speeds<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.900> three

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the lower end speeds here are three

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.520 
the lower end speeds here are three
thousand<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.180> six<00:01:33.180> hundred<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.380> down

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

to<00:02:09.629> write<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> screen<00:02:10.289> due<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> fact

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to write on the screen due to the fact

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.300 
to write on the screen due to the fact
that<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:12.060> running

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
that it's not running

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.649 
that it's not running
honeycomb<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.489> ice<00:02:14.610> cream<00:02:14.909> sandwich<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
honeycomb or ice cream sandwich at this

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.020 
honeycomb or ice cream sandwich at this
point<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.170> pin<00:02:16.890> functionality<00:02:17.519> is<00:02:17.640> limited

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
point that pin functionality is limited

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.210 
point that pin functionality is limited
but<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.689> supposed<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.409> better<00:02:19.620> one

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
but it's supposed to get better one

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.819 
but it's supposed to get better one
feature<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.549> like<00:02:20.610> about<00:02:20.909> these<00:02:21.709> buttons<00:02:22.709> here

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
feature I like about these buttons here

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.690 
feature I like about these buttons here
is<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.610> rotate<00:02:24.060> them<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:26.040> other

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
is that you can rotate them to the other

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
is that you can rotate them to the other
side<00:02:27.390> when<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:27.750> tilt<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.079> device<00:02:28.409> that's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
side when you tilt the device that's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.770 
side when you tilt the device that's
shifts<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.730> down<00:02:29.909> then<00:02:30.150> green<00:02:30.360> button<00:02:30.629> moves

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
shifts this down then green button moves

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.240 
shifts this down then green button moves
over<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.049> here<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:31.500> when<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.799> swap<00:02:32.099> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
over to here and then when you swap it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.339 
over to here and then when you swap it
back<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.209> rotates<00:02:33.360> back<00:02:33.810> around<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
back then it rotates back around the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.530 
back then it rotates back around the
problem<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:35.159> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:36.060> you're<00:02:36.209> holding

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
problem with this is if you're holding

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.369 
problem with this is if you're holding
device<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.750> flip<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.140> device

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
device like this and you flip the device

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.289 
device like this and you flip the device
around<00:02:40.709> then<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.579> get<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.879> button

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
around then what you get is the button

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.880 
around then what you get is the button
starts<00:02:42.689> getting<00:02:42.930> pressed<00:02:43.200> automatically

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
starts getting pressed automatically

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.979 
starts getting pressed automatically
there's<00:02:44.730> no<00:02:44.939> way<00:02:45.090> around<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> can

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
there's no way around that and you can

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.660 
there's no way around that and you can
see<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.200> menu<00:02:46.379> starts<00:02:46.739> popping<00:02:46.950> up<00:02:47.250> if<00:02:47.579> you're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
