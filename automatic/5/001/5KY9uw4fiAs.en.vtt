00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.270
 to make stuffed green peppers 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.200
 of ingredients omelette 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.870
 they are green peppers if possible 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.030
 they are not very twisted 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.170
 one or two eggs depending on the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.170
 amount that we are going to do 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.349
 tortilla 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.349
 salt oil 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.690
 potato and onion the first thing we do 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.520
 It's in a pan because the plentiful 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.610
 oil and fry or better throw the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.870
 Chive and potatoes together 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.170
 adding them sometime I 'd be in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.820
 criticism because the recipe here we have the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.879
 potato cut and it's small and the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.730
 onion also cut into pieces and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 now let's go we have to wait for it to 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.339
 cool well everything that is well blandita 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.339
 to remove it and add the egg 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.580
 good while we are doing the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.790
 potato and onion what we have done 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.100
 is to wash the peppers well and we have 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.400
 removed what is the tail 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 leaving a surface let's say list or 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.810
 be a straight cut so that then 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 with a spoon 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.140
 fill the peppers with the pasta 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.870
 of potato omelet then good 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.080
 because we already have here washed clean 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.760
 empty of pips and everything and now 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.700
 well let's keep waiting for it 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.799
 chill potato 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.409
 Well, we already have the onion and the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.680
 potato now we are going to drain it well from 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.439
 oil with a skimmer and we're going to take it out 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.240
 to a little dish once we have removed the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.000
 potato and onion we have mixed 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.069
 with an egg because for the amount that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.409
 let's do it with an egg is 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:08.470
 enough then we have mixed well 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.410
 what is going to make the tortilla and now 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.459
 with a small spoon because we're going to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.849
 go collecting quantities of this paste and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.640
 we are going to introduce the inside 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.230
 the green peppers that we still 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.879
 we have raw 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.790
 so good now a little bit of 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.099
 patience and let's fill them in now 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.260
 we have stuffed the peppers we have 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.150
 tried that the dough tails is already 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.430
 down the peppers to make it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.459
 well stuffed and then about the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.920
 next step is to seal what 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.599
 is the entrance of the pepper so that 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.629
 do not get stuffed 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.510
 then we will put them mouth upright 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.480
 down in a pan with oil well 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.150
 warm so that it is sensed and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.150
 seal what is the entrance of the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
 pepper 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.540
 and something not very strong then let's go 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:16.220
 seeing them on all sides so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.220
 that at the same time that the foundations are going 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.400
 making the tortilla but it will be cooking 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.200
 a good paper now let's wait for 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.050
 that they are doing well for all 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.650
 sides and sprinkle we have a little bit of 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.960
 salt and well I'm going to simply be 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.790
 Carlos, here we have our 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.870
 green peppers stuffed with tortilla 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.770
 potato we made them to fire a little 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.260
 slow medium slow to set 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.470
 stevie the tortilla inside then 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.680
 Well now we can cut them in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.080
 slices or else present them like that but 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.910
 good sliced ​​is very very curious 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.100
 because you see the tortilla inside 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.530
 we have split a pepper in half 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.530
 so you can see how the filling is 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.050
 then it is completely curdled 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.390
 tortilla 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.390
 and the combination is very rich 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 Well I hope you encourage them to do them and 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.720
 enjoy with them
