00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
would look what it looks like when I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.620 
would look what it looks like when I
turn<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.790> course<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
turn more on but of course there are a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020 
turn more on but of course there are a
lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> caves<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.159> well<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lot of caves down here as well so it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.719 
lot of caves down here as well so it
will<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.390> show<00:01:27.509> those<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.350> let's<00:01:29.159> say<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
will also show those but let's say if I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
will also show those but let's say if I
do<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> find<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.070> if

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
do want to go find out and know if

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
do want to go find out and know if
creeper<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.689> find<00:01:33.960> where<00:01:34.110> they

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
creeper or so you can find where they

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.010 
creeper or so you can find where they
are<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.680> caves<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.340> well<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
are in caves as well but just for the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
are in caves as well but just for the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
off because otherwise would be come too

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.090 
off because otherwise would be come too
messy<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.060> during<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> self<00:01:43.259> then

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
but I hope that's a bug that will be

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.400 
but I hope that's a bug that will be
fixed<00:02:37.489> because<00:02:37.670> I'm<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> bit
