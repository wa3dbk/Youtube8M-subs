 [Music] 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.780
 good we are here to talk about a 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 Brand two-piece suit 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.140
 alpinestars is from the 2012 collection and it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.820
 call alpinestars carver to peace is from 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 south 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 the two-piece suit charge them a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.070
 costume with whom they dominate a millimeter 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.150
 three then quite resistant to the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 abrasion we can appreciate a very good 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.739
 comfort in motorcycle position thanks to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 elastic that we find from the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.900
 clavicle to the wrist 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 this same elastic we find it in the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.550
 pants in between the legs and behind 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.050
 of the thighs and the knee for a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 best position sitting on the motorcycle 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.899
 it's a two- piece suit with what 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.970
 honestly I am very comfortable the truth 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.970
 is that other brands may adjust 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.310
 a lot more but this kind of costumes 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
 alpinestars would then be halfway 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.540
 between what is the sport and what is the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.340
 tourism and then well I tell you now 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.900
 now I'm so take it like 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.180
 a fur jacket to dress 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.159
 practically but always with their 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.950
 approved protections what is the 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.680
 forearm or elbow and then in the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.480
 shoulder in the knees and in the cydia 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.450
 we also have the protections 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.870
 This 2 pieces suit has a touch 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.850
 sporty because for the hump here 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.660
 we can see the hump the hump is for 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 create an aerodynamics together with the motorcycle 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.340
 it is not a protection to protect the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.580
 back do not forget to put a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 dorsal protection must also be said 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.180
 that although we always need a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 dorsal protection because it is level 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.620
 1 of level 2 is rigid and that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.380
 absorb this impact very well 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.260
 already standard, it carries a kind of foam 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.230
 of foam in everything that is the back that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.610
 in case of impact maybe it does not have 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.850
 the same projection as a trellis 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 but hey, it's always better than not wearing 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.660
 absolutely nothing in the part of the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.660
 ribs 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.340
 and the back we can also see a 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.450
 foam reinforcement 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.450
 in case of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.360
 of fall in case slides appointments are areas 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.430
 where usually one falls and we go 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.960
 better protected 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.980
 the inside the interior is a lining 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.300
 transmit antiallergic that can be 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.210
 remove to wash another here we can see 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.580
 that there is an inner pocket and another 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.520
 pocket on the other side 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.820
 of pocket maybe you can put what 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.490
 is the protection of xest or protection 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.160
 for for let's say for the chest area 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.050
 so I invite you to get on the bike now 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.150
 We got on the motorcycle and checked a 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.790
 little bit how do everything that works 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.650
 are the accordion leather elastics and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.610
 also because the elastics in the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.610
 elastic material 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.370
 Martin rises the amount and then 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.960
 we can see that he is going very comfortable in 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.370
 sitting position thanks to the elastic 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.760
 behind the leg as I said 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.110
 before and to the bellows that we have on top of 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.910
 knee 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.670
 these same necks are going to 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.520
 find strategies in areas such as 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.060
 shoulder blades or also here on the sides in 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.860
 the kidneys the bellows also very well 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.920
 located in the part of the kidneys in 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.330
 the pants so you can flex 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.220
 as you want on top of the motorbike 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.840
 honestly what stood out most of this 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.450
 costume is comfort yes that's true 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.220
 well, in some places I 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.140
 It's always a little bit obviously 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.270
 when a leather suit is left over 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.890
 it's always going to be more comfortable maybe not 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.200
 has the same protection when left over 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.420
 because in case of fall if there is more than 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.190
 inner lining can be moved 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.830
 because there is space left and you can 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.200
 download a little bit as the background or the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.389
 joints but honestly the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.979
 comfort of this suit 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.680
 Brutal brutal one thing I wanted 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.710
 underline that it is one of the few suits 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.590
 two pieces that carry pocket 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.469
 on the outside, that's fine when you 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 wants to put only the jacket with a few 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:37.150
 jeans other trousers that are not 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.840
 it was good because it can serve as 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.150
 jacket of every day city ​​another detail 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.310
 interesting is also that the welfare 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.770
 it is practically how it is a great 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.449
 manufacturer at the level of boots all their 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.029
 Leather suits and pants are 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.430
 indicated so that the boot goes through 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:56.319
 out of the suit then the suit goes by 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.240
 inside unlike other brands 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.689
 alpinestars all that is the part 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.210
 end of the costume is not leather but 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:07.569
 is in fabric that because then because 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.460
 obviously the boot fits very much if 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.680
 you have practically no space inside and 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
 above everything you have here of 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.300
 leather protections here a lot is done 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.159
 bulge and costs a lot of close annoying 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.060
 etcetera then mountaineers then 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.039
 intelligently 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.750
 maybe three or four fingers of tissue and 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.030
 the tissue obviously when it wrinkles 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.360
 because it does not do the same volume that it does 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.699
 leather and the truth is that the boot I'm going 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.879
 perfect perfect we would say that the 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.800
 corpse of your country is from the south is a is 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.770
 a range entry suit with a 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.669
 brutal price honestly for a suit 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.340
 leather at this price I had not seen 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.740
 none and I tell you you stand out above all 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.090
 its comfort and its versatility 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.009
 It is a suit that can serve 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.169
 quietly for a touring motorbike 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.539
 or if we want to enter the circuit once 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.880
 in time and such it takes little things like 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.889
 the che de paita that you can also 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.389
 let use it in sports facets 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.030
 if it's the first two-piece suit that 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:13.280
 you have to buy the green kart 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.280
 alpinestars is an incredible option 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.550
