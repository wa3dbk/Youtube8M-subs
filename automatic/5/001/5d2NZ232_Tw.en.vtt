00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
Robin and you tried to go across the you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.440 
Robin and you tried to go across the you
know<00:03:37.710> city<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.340> try<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.610> deactivate<00:03:39.180> the

other so like those little side missions
I<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:41.610> would<00:03:41.730> be<00:03:41.760> really<00:03:42.120> cool<00:03:42.920> but

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
I think that would be really cool but

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640 
I think that would be really cool but
yeah<00:03:44.850> we<00:03:45.120> need<00:03:45.330> Robin<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.870> Arkham<00:03:46.170> Knight<00:03:46.380> I
