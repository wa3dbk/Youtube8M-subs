00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
single week you'll probably end up you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.410 
single week you'll probably end up you
learn<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> lot<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.730> each<00:00:14.880> character

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
learn a lot more with each character

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.380 
learn a lot more with each character
goes<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:16.310> but<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.609> try<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.850> way<00:00:18.210> you'll

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
goes on but if you try this way you'll

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.880 
goes on but if you try this way you'll
probably<00:00:18.600> end<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.080> five<00:00:19.320> treasure<00:00:19.619> keys

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
your three characters if you keep doing

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.230 
your three characters if you keep doing
this<00:00:25.590> you'll<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.279> end<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.699> more

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
this you'll probably end up with more

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.689 
this you'll probably end up with more
than<00:00:27.480> five<00:00:27.720> keys<00:00:28.080> every<00:00:28.529> single<00:00:28.710> week<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.550> what

the same thing you do for your
boundaries<00:00:34.530> i<00:00:34.739> taught<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
boundaries i taught you are in the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.569 
boundaries i taught you are in the
previous<00:00:35.670> video<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.980> get<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.280> exotic

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
previous video of how to get more exotic

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.660 
previous video of how to get more exotic
bounties<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.590> way<00:00:40.649> how<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.340> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
bounties and this is a way how to get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
bounties and this is a way how to get
more<00:00:42.620> treasure<00:00:43.620> keys<00:00:44.539> this<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.050> foolproof

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
more treasure keys this way is foolproof

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.979 
more treasure keys this way is foolproof
I<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.629> do

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I do it all the time and I actually do

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
I do it all the time and I actually do
get<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.620> treasure<00:00:50.520> kids<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.270> what

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
get more treasure kids than I know what

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720 
get more treasure kids than I know what
to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.260> probably<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.160> don't

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to do this I probably have like I don't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.869 
to do this I probably have like I don't
know<00:00:54.350> four<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.379> five<00:00:55.739> maybe<00:00:56.489> even<00:00:56.640> six
