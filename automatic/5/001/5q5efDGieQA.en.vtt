and another microphone so really nicely

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.550 
and another microphone so really nicely
exposed<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.079> noticed<00:01:58.439> with

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
exposed now the one thing I noticed with

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
exposed now the one thing I noticed with
this<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.950> don't<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.490> lay<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> table

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
this you don't have lay on the table

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
this you don't have lay on the table
protection<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.079> there's<00:02:01.259> no<00:02:01.469> raised<00:02:02.040> lip<00:02:02.430> here

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
protection so there's no raised lip here

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.749 
protection so there's no raised lip here
really<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.450> mean<00:02:03.630> very<00:02:04.200> very<00:02:04.350> slightly<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.640> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
really I mean very very slightly so it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.980 
really I mean very very slightly so it's
not<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> lay<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> down

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
not really like you want to lay it down

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.559 
not really like you want to lay it down
everywhere<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:09.030> could<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
everywhere like that you could do that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.990 
everywhere like that you could do that
but<00:02:09.899> without<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.440> screen<00:02:10.739> protector<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
but without a screen protector on it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
but without a screen protector on it
you<00:02:12.360> may<00:02:12.540> want<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:12.840> twice<00:02:13.020> about<00:02:13.230> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you may want to think twice about that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200 
you may want to think twice about that
now<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.040> offer<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.490> screen<00:02:14.730> protector<00:02:15.180> on

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
now they do offer a screen protector on

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.240 
now they do offer a screen protector on
their<00:02:15.450> website<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.410> around<00:02:16.680> $10

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
their website I think it's around $10

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.520 
their website I think it's around $10
also<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.270> two<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.570> them<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.380> can

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
also for one or two of them and you can

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680 
also for one or two of them and you can
get<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> phones

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
get that but I kind of like the phones

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
get that but I kind of like the phones
without<00:02:21.900> screen<00:02:22.290> protectors<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:23.130> I'm

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
without screen protectors on them I'm

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.160 
without screen protectors on them I'm
pretty<00:02:23.550> careful<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:24.060> them<00:02:24.210> myself<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.990> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
pretty careful with them myself but this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
pretty careful with them myself but this
one<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.470> particular<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.460> liked<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
one in particular I kind of liked the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.070 
one in particular I kind of liked the
orange<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.360> didn't<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.690> many<00:02:27.930> other

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
orange they didn't have many other

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
orange they didn't have many other
colors<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.590> stock<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> time<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.580> they

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
colors in stock at the time I think they

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.760 
colors in stock at the time I think they
had<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> orange<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.420> green<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> picked<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
had the orange and green so I picked the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.070 
had the orange and green so I picked the
orange<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.459> very<00:02:32.910> very<00:02:33.330> bright<00:02:33.660> orange

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
orange this is a very very bright orange

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.920 
orange this is a very very bright orange
and<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:35.310> didn't<00:02:36.090> really<00:02:36.360> think<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:36.810> be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and I didn't really think it would be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.260 
and I didn't really think it would be
that<00:02:37.080> bright<00:02:37.459> but<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.550> looks<00:02:38.730> good<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.240> can

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
that bright but it looks good you can

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.880 
that bright but it looks good you can
see<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.970> white<00:02:41.970> packaging<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
see here this is the white packaging and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.490 
see here this is the white packaging and
orange<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:45.930> stands<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.440> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
orange and it's it really stands out and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.960 
orange and it's it really stands out and
that<00:02:46.770> might<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.489> under<00:02:47.640> bright

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that might be because I'm under bright

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.150 
that might be because I'm under bright
light<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> hand<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:49.950> makes

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
light but in the hand it actually makes

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.680 
light but in the hand it actually makes
the<00:02:50.310> phone<00:02:50.520> feel<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> little<00:02:51.239> bit<00:02:51.480> more

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the phone feel a little bit more

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.740 
the phone feel a little bit more
slippery<00:02:52.080> than<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.980> textured<00:02:53.489> back<00:02:53.730> does<00:02:54.060> but

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
slippery than the textured back does but

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
slippery than the textured back does but
it<00:02:54.870> does<00:02:55.110> prevent<00:02:55.560> things<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.130> scratches

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
it does prevent things like scratches

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.460 
it does prevent things like scratches
you<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.030> see<00:02:57.239> right<00:02:57.420> here<00:02:57.450> probably<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
you can see right here probably that I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.199 
you can see right here probably that I
have<00:02:58.770> some<00:02:59.130> scratches<00:02:59.670> right<00:02:59.820> around<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
have some scratches right around the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.580 
have some scratches right around the
bottom<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> camera<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.080> that's<00:03:01.230> from<00:03:01.440> not

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
bottom of the camera and that's from not

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.410 
bottom of the camera and that's from not
using<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.100> case<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.700> setting<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> down<00:03:03.239> on

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
using a case and just setting it down on

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.840 
using a case and just setting it down on
the<00:03:03.510> table<00:03:03.690> picking<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.400> started

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
the table picking it up and it started

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.640 
the table picking it up and it started
to<00:03:05.910> scratch<00:03:06.239> off<00:03:06.540> some<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.050> finish<00:03:07.350> over

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
to scratch off some of the finish over

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
to scratch off some of the finish over
time<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.550> will<00:03:08.670> prevent<00:03:09.000> some<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.480> but

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
time so it will prevent some of that but

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.600 
time so it will prevent some of that but
other<00:03:10.410> than<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.860> there<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> little

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
other than that there is like a little

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.630 
other than that there is like a little
plastic<00:03:12.530> something<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.950> feel<00:03:14.220> it's

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
plastic something here that I feel it's

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.160 
plastic something here that I feel it's
it's<00:03:15.060> rough<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:15.510> other<00:03:15.690> than<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> whole

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it's rough but other than that the whole

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.860 
it's rough but other than that the whole
the<00:03:16.709> whole<00:03:16.890> surface<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:18.180> smooth<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the whole surface is really smooth and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.710 
the whole surface is really smooth and
nice<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.640> other<00:03:20.760> videos<00:03:21.180> we

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
nice and in one of the other videos we

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.420 
nice and in one of the other videos we
took<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> look<00:03:22.110> at<00:03:22.260> their<00:03:22.410> flip<00:03:22.709> case<00:03:23.010> as<00:03:23.220> well

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
took a look at their flip case as well

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.949 
took a look at their flip case as well
and<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.820> one's<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.540> nicer<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
and that one's a little bit nicer and

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.370 
and that one's a little bit nicer and
only<00:03:25.650> four<00:03:25.980> dollars<00:03:26.100> more<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.239> covers<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
only four dollars more so and covers the
