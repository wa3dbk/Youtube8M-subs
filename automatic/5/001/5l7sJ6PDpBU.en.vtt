00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
stuff like that something creative where

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.210 
stuff like that something creative where
you<00:01:06.229> can<00:01:06.380> use<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.680> environment<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.190> your

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
you can use the environment to your

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.100 
you can use the environment to your
advantage<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.420> saw<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> little<00:01:08.900> bit<00:01:09.020> of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
advantage and we saw a little bit of
