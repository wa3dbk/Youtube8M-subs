00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.900
 Photographing in the sun is Martina's special challenge 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.280
 Grunert explains in this movie the heart and for which 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.280
 Camera settings he decides 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 we all know 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.700
 many photos many girls in photos of their own among many, yes so 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.560
 to photographers the outdoor 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.150
 working against the sun, photographing directly in the sun 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.980
 Studi BIZ devices with it up with it 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.550
 to which great light form 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 around 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.130
 but not a big achievement if you really have enough the question 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.930
 but what is the exciting we can do with a normal digital 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.140
 Gameplay comrade everyone the 90 and a properly hold a dining table 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.910
 make their 20 on tablets on such photos and if so how can we 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.620
 such photos make it like children too so short technique we have here 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.450
 The d90 Hermann Funk triggers of Geneva closer we just have the SB 24 and 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.690
 the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.850
 and of course our technology the sun in the background and here on the roof of the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.700
 Race that's the great models 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.210
 we have to photograph the glass unfortunately it is a bit more difficult today 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.910
 as otherwise end usually consumers have blue sky we have 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.510
 get one right this one today 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.660
 I know that means we have a little harder all around 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.800
 Seidels before us that the pictures are not really that blue 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.250
 Sky" 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.690
 as they might be but followed from familiar as easy 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.960
 in the connection to which we are the same as marriages 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.750
 there would be 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.160
 again other skies deep blue 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.030
 but comes for the first time in recordings 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.460
 it is damn bright 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.530
 and we honestly want blue sky so what are we going to do as we go 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 Neurosis camera 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.009
 we can turn live mode on or just play around 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.070
 out of the mold I can say I custom at least the 100 so 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 live from 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 16 and a case Werth Fr 2 Hunderstel at the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.909
 Nicole decision at 200-300 so we go to the 22 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.680
 The lens is not synonymous n2 more and that is wonderful why 200 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.690
 and we have to work with that if we get much less light from the d90 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.450
 Not with the motive, that's all you can take away and now there 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.180
 the question what to do with the flash of the joke on tablets has one 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.789
 limited eleven with each performance 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.999
 that's the problem 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.099
 this performance somehow 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.049
 must be strengthened and strengthened me that clearly about the Zuger 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.029
 bundle the light and really do not throw everything we have 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.590
 Ganswindt had the place we need 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.560
 and where do not we need it on the face on the upper body 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.840
 more meaningful to us 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.369
 Without taking the first picture we already know the widower thinking that 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.110
 7 is not from down here 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.949
 and focus on the upper body Lobo body 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:47.429
 So we'll certainly spot athletes coming to see the effect on the photos and 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.819
 then it is so far from distance we are working here on the absurd 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.679
 Power range that means the balls of 22 at this 200 because he would need 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.559
 do not think about it that's right on the limit of sog on Vettel's me 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.869
 know from experience from ines-2 make all then you know that too 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.279
 The work here about distance two meters and a half meters in the 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.709
 Area 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.769
 is it really that close to partially on the photos even for 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.009
 Tripod and wishes the foot of the city Eavis have it 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.379
 I do not want it at all I want to have covered but then I keel myself 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.029
 Immediately the performance and do not have more 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.589
 the NÃ¶m shown to the leadership 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.420
 all the energy we have to guide so the maximum it gets 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.700
 which collects bundled and then as close as possible to our model 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.799
 thrown 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.990
 Let's see I'm curious if it works 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.639
 that means I activate radio trigger 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.829
 I take a picture of the sky here in the wide angle 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:36.390
 to get 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.600
 that usually brings very little if I only the upper body only that 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.459
 Face or four then you can do the same in the studio how much 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.919
 Western Collection 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.179
 Problem just times 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.809
 the bouquet is coming 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.809
 he is on like that 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.909
 85 millimeters 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.469
 The track is a bit KAC apart so she can calm down 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.360
 really apart and push through exactly 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.360
 Push the pum to the back 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.369
 yes we can do it 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:09.399
 the wars 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.539
 you see 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.099
 it is possible 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.989
 we get exposed correctly 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.079
 her face we have dropped the spread in this protein it says 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.940
 but wondering where he's just beginning to see that we can already grasp more because of that 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.779
 is almost black in the photo 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.659
 and here they come in the sun but unfortunately in the photo see the result 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.430
 one 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.320
 Faltin second possible choice for on such a day with son the sky 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.729
 this pretty damn hard to get louse at all 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:35.870
 we have to deal with it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.870
 to be satisfied 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.020
 Not
