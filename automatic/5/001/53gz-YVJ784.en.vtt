when<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.219> take<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> look<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.730> Mars<00:00:11.940> you

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
when you take a look at Mars you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.610 
when you take a look at Mars you
probably<00:00:12.750> wouldn't<00:00:13.080> think<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.379> it<00:00:13.469> looks

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
probably wouldn't think that it looks

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.070 
probably wouldn't think that it looks
like<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> very<00:00:13.980> nice<00:00:14.190> place<00:00:14.459> to<00:00:14.639> live<00:00:14.760> it's<00:00:15.660> dry

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
like a very nice place to live it's dry

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.929 
like a very nice place to live it's dry
it's<00:00:16.500> dusty<00:00:16.950> and<00:00:17.130> there's<00:00:17.369> practically<00:00:17.730> no

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
it's dusty and there's practically no

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.970 
it's dusty and there's practically no
atmosphere<00:00:18.450> but<00:00:19.259> some<00:00:19.470> scientists<00:00:19.950> think

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
atmosphere but some scientists think

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.320 
atmosphere but some scientists think
that<00:00:20.160> Mars<00:00:20.430> may<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.640> once<00:00:20.939> looked<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
that Mars may have once looked like a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
that Mars may have once looked like a
much<00:00:21.570> nicer<00:00:21.750> place<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.169> live<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.919> a<00:00:22.980> thicker

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
much nicer place to live with a thicker

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
much nicer place to live with a thicker
atmosphere<00:00:23.310> cloudy<00:00:24.300> skies<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> possibly

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
atmosphere cloudy skies and possibly

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.019 
atmosphere cloudy skies and possibly
even<00:00:25.650> liquid<00:00:26.130> water<00:00:26.309> flowing<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:26.790> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
even liquid water flowing over the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.999 
even liquid water flowing over the
surface<00:00:27.360> so<00:00:28.050> how<00:00:28.169> do<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:28.500> something

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
surface so how do you go from something

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.510 
surface so how do you go from something
like<00:00:29.040> this<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:30.360> something<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.520> NASA's

idea of how Mars lost its atmosphere and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
idea of how Mars lost its atmosphere and
scientists<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:36.960> several<00:00:37.410> processes

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
