machinable here is the original HD part
initially<00:01:52.160> I<00:01:52.310> thought<00:01:52.759> I'd<00:01:53.600> replace<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.350> with

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
initially I thought I'd replace it with

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.010 
initially I thought I'd replace it with
a<00:01:54.560> piece<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.830> aluminum<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.700> copper<00:01:56.090> butter

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
a piece of aluminum and copper butter

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.880 
a piece of aluminum and copper butter
eyes<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.770> piece<00:01:58.100> is<00:01:58.369> incredibly<00:01:59.360> hard

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
eyes that this piece is incredibly hard

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.740 
eyes that this piece is incredibly hard
so<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.160> must<00:02:01.429> be<00:02:01.520> some<00:02:01.880> kind<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.270> tempered

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
so it must be some kind of tempered

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.440 
so it must be some kind of tempered
steel<00:02:02.780> which<00:02:03.259> I'm<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.619> able<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.160> replicate

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
steel which I'm not able to replicate

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.630 
steel which I'm not able to replicate
since<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.569> pizza<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> structural<00:02:07.310> part

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
since this pizza is a structural part

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.450 
since this pizza is a structural part
that<00:02:08.300> influences<00:02:09.110> directly<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.860> mechanics

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
that influences directly the mechanics

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.670 
that influences directly the mechanics
of<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.789> steering<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.480> consequently<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
of the steering and consequently the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.950 
of the steering and consequently the
safety<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> driver<00:02:13.700> I've<00:02:14.360> decided<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
safety of the driver I've decided to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.460 
safety of the driver I've decided to
build<00:02:15.319> my<00:02:15.650> face<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.690> will<00:02:17.900> also<00:02:18.050> give<00:02:18.350> me

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
build my face out this will also give me

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
build my face out this will also give me
a<00:02:18.500> chance<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:19.280> demonstrating<00:02:20.270> how<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> work

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
a chance of demonstrating how to work

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.910 
a chance of demonstrating how to work
the<00:02:21.290> stock<00:02:21.620> from<00:02:22.370> two<00:02:22.580> sides<00:02:23.170> now<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.620> stock

we can insert our copper part with the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.850 
we can insert our copper part with the
logo<00:03:11.610> design<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> let's<00:03:13.770> get<00:03:13.920> started<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:18.860> be

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
logo design so let's get started to be

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.130 
logo design so let's get started to be
able<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.280> design<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.790> new<00:03:20.970> part<00:03:21.300> we<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:21.990> to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
able to design the new part we have to

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.980 
able to design the new part we have to
digitalize<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:23.190> original<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:24.780> so

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
digitalize the original one and to do so

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.530 
digitalize the original one and to do so
I<00:03:25.200> usually<00:03:25.740> start<00:03:26.010> by<00:03:26.250> scanning<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.030> part<00:03:27.270> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
I usually start by scanning the part and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.630 
I usually start by scanning the part and
important<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.290> picture<00:03:28.650> into<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> CAD

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
important the picture into a CAD

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.820 
important the picture into a CAD
software<00:03:29.910> where<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
software where I then can make the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.770 
software where I then can make the
design<00:03:32.190> out<00:03:32.490> of<00:03:32.910> polylines<00:03:35.630> industrial<00:03:36.630> and

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
design out of polylines industrial and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.690 
design out of polylines industrial and
homemade<00:03:37.230> products<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:37.860> both<00:03:38.100> created

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
homemade products are both created

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.340 
homemade products are both created
having<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.060> respect<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> same<00:03:39.720> mechanical

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
and physics rules and limits so I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.230 
and physics rules and limits so I
usually<00:03:43.560> suppose<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.550> engineer<00:03:45.060> that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
usually suppose that the engineer that

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.120 
usually suppose that the engineer that
designed<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.750> part<00:03:46.050> followed<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> same

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
designed this part followed the same

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.570 
designed this part followed the same
thought<00:03:47.430> process<00:03:47.460> that<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.360> wouldn't<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> if<00:03:50.460> I

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
thought process that I wouldn't so if I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.580 
thought process that I wouldn't so if I
was<00:03:50.730> him<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.150> would<00:03:51.210> have<00:03:51.570> started<00:03:51.870> by<00:03:52.170> making

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
was him I would have started by making

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.860 
was him I would have started by making
the<00:03:52.770> concentric<00:03:53.370> circles<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.120> are<00:03:54.570> tied<00:03:54.840> to

the concentric circles that are tied to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.310 
the concentric circles that are tied to
an<00:03:55.200> existing<00:03:55.770> geometry<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.480> start<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
an existing geometry so I start with the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.100 
an existing geometry so I start with the
fork<00:03:58.590> all

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
fork all

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.830 
fork all
and<00:04:00.350> then<00:04:01.280> using<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> center<00:04:02.270> of<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:02.600> circle

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
and then using the center of this circle

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.170 
and then using the center of this circle
I<00:04:03.320> create<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.250> outside<00:04:04.610> circular<00:04:05.150> edge<00:04:07.180> since

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
I create the outside circular edge since

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.940 
I create the outside circular edge since
most<00:04:08.810> likely<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.440> shape<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.860> symmetrical

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
most likely the shape is symmetrical

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.000 
that
I<00:05:52.010> place<00:05:52.580> two<00:05:52.610> holes<00:05:53.180> on<00:05:53.600> top<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.350> bottom<00:05:54.860> of

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
I place two holes on top and bottom of

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:02.850 
I place two holes on top and bottom of
the<00:05:55.310> vertical<00:05:55.520> center<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.450> design

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.950 

then<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.100> like<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.610> leave<00:06:04.880> some<00:06:05.120> extra<00:06:05.300> feeding

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
then I like to leave some extra feeding

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.450 
then I like to leave some extra feeding

room for the pass to simplify
installation<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.810> I'll<00:06:08.960> do<00:06:09.110> an<00:06:09.260> offset<00:06:09.710> of

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
installation so I'll do an offset of

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.880 
installation so I'll do an offset of
zero<00:06:10.580> point<00:06:11.120> three<00:06:11.360> millimeters<00:06:11.990> around<00:06:12.740> the

zero point three millimeters around the
original<00:06:13.280> shape<00:06:16.300> now<00:06:17.300> we<00:06:17.630> can<00:06:18.140> let<00:06:18.320> the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
original shape now we can let the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.960 
original shape now we can let the
creativity<00:06:19.010> run<00:06:19.280> wild

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
creativity run wild

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.680 
creativity run wild
I<00:06:20.000> chose<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.990> give<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:21.260> this<00:06:21.410> shape<00:06:22.420> this<00:06:23.420> is

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
I chose to give it this shape this is

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.390 
I chose to give it this shape this is
the<00:06:23.870> aluminum<00:06:24.260> plate<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.770> will<00:06:24.920> cover<00:06:25.250> up

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
the aluminum plate that will cover up

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400 
the aluminum plate that will cover up
the<00:06:25.700> original<00:06:26.120> piece<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.750> give<00:06:26.990> us<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.230> mess

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
the original piece and give us a mess

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.590 
the original piece and give us a mess
structure<00:06:27.920> to<00:06:28.190> hold<00:06:28.280> in<00:06:28.550> place<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:29.240> copper

a<00:06:33.260> log<00:06:33.500> of<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.740> side<00:06:33.920> on<00:06:34.490> it<00:06:35.020> all<00:06:36.020> we<00:06:36.350> have<00:06:36.440> left

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
a log of the side on it all we have left

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.040 
a log of the side on it all we have left
to<00:06:36.740> do<00:06:36.920> is<00:06:37.130> to<00:06:37.580> separate<00:06:38.000> every<00:06:38.450> designing<00:06:38.930> to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
to do is to separate every designing to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.050 
to do is to separate every designing to
different<00:06:39.410> layers<00:06:39.620> so<00:06:39.950> it<00:06:40.400> can<00:06:40.550> be<00:06:40.670> used<00:06:40.910> to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
different layers so it can be used to

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.410 
different layers so it can be used to
create<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.900> toolpath<00:06:42.700> now<00:06:43.700> let's<00:06:43.970> print<00:06:44.180> it

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
create the toolpath now let's print it

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.390 
create the toolpath now let's print it
and<00:06:44.630> let's<00:06:45.230> see<00:06:45.350> what<00:06:45.530> it<00:06:45.650> looks<00:06:45.800> like<00:06:46.010> on<00:06:46.250> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
and let's see what it looks like on the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720 
and let's see what it looks like on the
buttock<00:06:47.380> now<00:06:48.380> is<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:48.680> time<00:06:48.860> to<00:06:49.190> verify<00:06:49.700> for

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
buttock now is the time to verify for

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.830 
buttock now is the time to verify for
paper<00:06:50.270> model<00:06:50.930> fits<00:06:51.470> the<00:06:51.590> bike<00:06:52.100> I<00:06:52.570> decided<00:06:53.570> to

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
paper model fits the bike I decided to

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.870 
paper model fits the bike I decided to
use<00:06:54.020> this<00:06:54.230> shape<00:06:54.560> also<00:06:55.100> to<00:06:55.340> complement

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
use this shape also to complement

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.300 
use this shape also to complement
another<00:06:56.300> great<00:06:56.720> piece<00:06:57.050> of<00:06:57.290> this<00:06:57.410> bike<00:06:57.650> which

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
another great piece of this bike which

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.210 
another great piece of this bike which
is<00:06:58.520> the<00:06:58.730> headlight<00:06:59.300> so<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.320> point<00:07:00.560> points<00:07:01.040> to

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
is the headlight so the point points to

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.140 
is the headlight so the point points to
it<00:07:01.510> but<00:07:02.510> anybody<00:07:02.930> can<00:07:03.410> choose<00:07:03.710> the<00:07:03.950> shape<00:07:04.430> or

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
it but anybody can choose the shape or

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.110 
it but anybody can choose the shape or
logo<00:07:05.780> that<00:07:06.080> it<00:07:06.350> prefers<00:07:06.740> it<00:07:07.130> really<00:07:07.880> is<00:07:08.090> a

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
logo that it prefers it really is a

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.710 
logo that it prefers it really is a
matter<00:07:08.600> of<00:07:08.720> respecting<00:07:09.530> the<00:07:10.070> positions<00:07:10.730> of

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
matter of respecting the positions of

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.020 
matter of respecting the positions of
the<00:07:12.020> two<00:07:12.050> hole<00:07:12.380> for<00:07:12.680> the<00:07:12.800> balls<00:07:12.980> in<00:07:13.670> our<00:07:13.790> case

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
the two hole for the balls in our case

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.050 
the two hole for the balls in our case
the<00:07:14.270> paper<00:07:14.480> model<00:07:14.900> fits<00:07:15.170> I<00:07:15.440> really<00:07:16.340> like<00:07:16.550> what

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
the paper model fits I really like what

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.030 
the paper model fits I really like what
it<00:07:17.210> looks<00:07:17.360> like<00:07:17.600> let's<00:07:18.290> go<00:07:18.500> back<00:07:18.710> to<00:07:18.919> the

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
it looks like let's go back to the

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.600 
it looks like let's go back to the
studio<00:07:19.310> to<00:07:20.090> machine<00:07:20.450> it
