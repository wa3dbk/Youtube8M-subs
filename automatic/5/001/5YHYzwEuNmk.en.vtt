 they say that all changes are good 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.860
 but I believe in the previous one it was not the no 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.409
 it was what was expected true 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.009
 ok but since we are not 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.569
 know if in the hat they are going to bring 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.569
 some gun or something or 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.219
 definitely that and now it 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.950
 I was because they came from the polka 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.630
 since 1800 and fairs here when they founded 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.520
 from Villa de Santiago and from there 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.929
 because there comes up to the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.270
 foundation from here of our good that 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.729
 I was going to tell you based on what I'm here 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.979
 thank you sir chabÃ¡n to you my new 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.160
 producer and truth which should not 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.230
 to be here is elizabeth 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.350
 that from the beginning we had agreed 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.960
 I was in your comfort zone because it's 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.630
 a girl with ports because it's very her 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.050
 problem but I think here the one that's left 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 is she in agreement and if she is going to vote 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.130

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 no no no no no no no here the truth does not sin 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.050
 but it bothers me so I'm 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.870
 willing if my friends or colleagues go 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.880
 to notice that from outside then outside and if 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.420
 not to leave or to leave but to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.020
 hidden another like that directly 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.020
