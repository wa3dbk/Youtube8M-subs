00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
want to waste my time with that so I

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.400 
want to waste my time with that so I
just<00:04:56.250> killed<00:04:56.670> all<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.940> guards<00:04:57.300> but<00:04:58.080> there's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
just killed all the guards but there's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.380 
just killed all the guards but there's
everything<00:04:58.950> in<00:04:59.280> there<00:04:59.520> except<00:04:59.880> for<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.210> a

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
everything in there except for the a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.820 
everything in there except for the a
chest<00:05:00.750> piece<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.320> dwarven<00:05:02.010> armor<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.320> guess

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
chest piece of dwarven armor so I guess

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.000 
chest piece of dwarven armor so I guess
that's<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.520> pretty<00:05:05.730> good<00:05:05.940> spot<00:05:06.240> if<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.840> uh<00:05:07.010> you

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
that's a pretty good spot if you uh you

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.340 
that's a pretty good spot if you uh you
don't<00:05:08.160> want<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.730> get<00:05:08.880> orcish<00:05:09.270> armor<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.840> once
