00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.900 

now<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.640> good<00:00:08.850> take

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
now this is a good take

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.720 
now this is a good take
for<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:11.420> speed<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:15.160> looked<00:00:16.160> at<00:00:16.309> that<00:00:16.340> Muse

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
for the speed and looked at that Muse

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.990 
for the speed and looked at that Muse
baseline<00:00:18.070> also<00:00:19.070> if<00:00:19.189> we<00:00:19.340> look<00:00:19.520> at<00:00:19.700> something

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
baseline also if we look at something

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.690 
baseline also if we look at something
like<00:00:22.270> good<00:00:23.270> times<00:00:23.599> by<00:00:23.900> chic<00:00:24.259> this<00:00:25.220> technique

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
like good times by chic this technique

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.290 
like good times by chic this technique
comes<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.270> as<00:00:26.390> well<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.890> what<00:00:28.790> I<00:00:28.820> want<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.180> look

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
comes in as well so what I want to look

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.030 
comes in as well so what I want to look
at<00:00:29.509> doing<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.890> playing<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:33.050> E<00:00:33.079> minor<00:00:33.500> scale

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
at doing is playing the E minor scale

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.720 
at doing is playing the E minor scale
but<00:00:34.399> just<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.420> D<00:00:35.690> string

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
but just on the D string

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
but just on the D string
so<00:00:37.730> we'd<00:00:37.910> play<00:00:38.149> e<00:00:40.149> f-sharp<00:00:41.149> G

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so we'd play e f-sharp G

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.439 
so we'd play e f-sharp G
now<00:00:44.399> another<00:00:44.579> way<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> look<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.179> this<00:00:45.269> if<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
now another way to look at this if you

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.110 
now another way to look at this if you
know<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.870> E<00:00:45.899> minor<00:00:46.260> scale<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.760> seventh

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
know your E minor scale from the seventh

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
know your E minor scale from the seventh
fret<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.769> sort<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
fret here you know I have sort of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
fret here you know I have sort of
reference<00:00:59.579> points<00:00:59.969> around<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> neck<00:01:00.689> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
reference points around the neck you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
reference points around the neck you
know<00:01:01.739> here's<00:01:02.070> e<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.939> e<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:04.350> e<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> ever

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
know here's e is e is e so if you ever

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.480 
know here's e is e is e so if you ever
find<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> getting<00:01:07.740> lost<00:01:08.130> where

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
find you're kind of getting lost where

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.080 
find you're kind of getting lost where
to<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:09.080> think<00:01:10.080> here's<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> e<00:01:10.649> so<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to go think here's the e so this is this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.070 
to go think here's the e so this is this
is<00:01:12.149> one<00:01:12.479> two<00:01:12.689> three<00:01:13.049> four<00:01:13.470> five<00:01:13.920> six<00:01:14.369> yeah<00:01:15.090> Izzy

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
is one two three four five six yeah Izzy

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.749 
is one two three four five six yeah Izzy
one<00:01:16.159> two<00:01:17.159> three<00:01:17.399> four<00:01:17.909> five<00:01:18.149> six<00:01:18.420> seven<00:01:18.990> eight

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.039 
one two three four five six seven eight
so<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.789> end<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.179> with<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:22.229> three<00:01:24.049> four

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so we end up with one two three four

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
so we end up with one two three four
five<00:01:25.409> six<00:01:26.690> seven<00:01:27.690> eight<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.819> if<00:01:29.819> we<00:01:29.940> wanted<00:01:30.209> me

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
five six seven eight and if we wanted me

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.600 
five six seven eight and if we wanted me
to<00:01:30.420> carry<00:01:30.690> on

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:47.810 

yeah<00:01:34.620> so<00:01:35.620> practice<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.700> scale<00:01:36.910> of<00:01:37.030> one<00:01:37.150> string

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.800 

good<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.570> play<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.170> know<00:01:50.230> have<00:01:50.620> as<00:01:50.710> few<00:01:51.810> shifts

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
good to play you know have as few shifts

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.510 
good to play you know have as few shifts
as<00:01:53.140> possible<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:54.010> don't<00:01:54.040> want<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.400> be

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
as possible so we don't want to be

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:08.700 
as possible so we don't want to be
playing<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.340> play<00:02:03.670> finger<00:02:04.540> wise<00:02:04.950> 1<00:02:05.950> 3<00:02:06.310> 4<00:02:07.679> 1<00:02:08.679> 3

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
playing so I play finger wise 1 3 4 1 3

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.449 
playing so I play finger wise 1 3 4 1 3
4<00:02:11.850> then<00:02:12.850> down<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.800> use<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.280> finger

briefly but he plays so this is why this
is<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> good<00:03:52.799> technique<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.189> practice<00:03:53.819> if<00:03:54.000> you

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
is a good technique to practice if you

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.970 
is a good technique to practice if you
want<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.360> do<00:03:54.540> suddenly<00:03:55.379> do<00:03:55.530> something<00:03:55.829> very

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
want to do suddenly do something very

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:23.659 
want to do suddenly do something very
fast<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> same<00:04:22.919> with<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> muse<00:04:23.430> we're

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
fast and the same with the muse we're

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:38.580 
fast and the same with the muse we're
doing<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.940> same

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.760 

so<00:04:39.580> play<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:39.880> I'm<00:04:40.450> playing<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.930> E<00:04:41.080> minor

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.600 

with<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.860> opening<00:04:45.280> between<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.920> why<00:04:48.310> not<00:04:48.490> play

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
with the opening between so why not play
