00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello, how are you? Here we are again. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.759
 for recording our problem tips 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.890
 homemade 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.349
 Today we are going to do the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 suggestions submitted on youtube 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.529
 our calabrian recipe for our 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.840
 today is a recipe more for adults 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 because there are many seasonings 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.060
 so we'll use the following 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.010
 ingredients two tablespoons of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.420
 onion grated two teeth large daily 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 chopped very small 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 two tablespoons of green scent 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.739
 This one is already a girl 's finger. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.980
 very strong but let's use only one piece 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.450
 so found small piece - pi capita 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 I left that for you to see how 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.449
 she is and we will also use a pinch 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.719
 calabrian pepper just a pinch of the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.719
 People, she's very strong too. 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.930
 let's also use a pinch of oregano 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 and a pinch of cummin like that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.670
 ingredient that we made our 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.750
 homemade seasoning remember 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.700
 and here we have the juice of three lemons 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 we have a pound of potato balls 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.900
 that little potato and the oil August 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 these are our ingredients to our 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.000
 pepperoni potato 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.159
 We played the potatoes well. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.579
 We cleaned it now, we 'll put it on 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.320
 a pan and covered with water and let's 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.630
 put a spoonful of salt 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 Now we're going to take the fire to stay the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 cooking al dente she can not stay 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 overcooked or raw 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.799
 We 'll leave cooking with the 15 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 minutes or so this recipe is 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.970
 made from potato with peel 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.210
 so we'll leave the potato 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.219
 cooking until sticking point 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.570
 Let's stick around waiting for her. 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.770
 Cook 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.770
 We are going to put the cbo 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.340
 in the onion hut because in this recipe 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.899
 we do not get to see you or look at 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.899
 placing directly to the tv 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.030
 let's just hope to dry a little 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 Water 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.890
 she was in about this second is 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.080
 shut up is repressed 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.530
 but there's always a little water there 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 we put the pan to finish 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.280
 dry 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 there we put the floor mix 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.940
 we closed a little gold plate is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 of user 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.300
 the smell good people 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.300
 now we are going to play brother 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.709
 My family always did with the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.330
 animal but if you do not have a brother 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:11.440
 can put vinegar is an option it is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.350
 much better a good taste now 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.819
 move a little bit 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.840
 and meanwhile we do not look at 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.050
 potato 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 she was already with such a lining tooth 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.810
 she can not cook too much 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.010
 we'll get to put a colander 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 to draw the hot water 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.500
 if we just leave it the way it is 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.100
 there is hot it to continue cooking 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.360
 so we have to put in the cold water 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.200
 for the kitchen 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.470
 we get cold water and we'll put the 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.140
 hot potato in the ugly water 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.690
 We'll leave it undisclosed and we'll 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.769
 continue our pride 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.420
 now we'll put the green scent 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.420
 Let's just put that company 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.880
 Let's put the oregano cumin 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.170
 we put the girl finger pepper 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.919
 now we 've got a little focus 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.039
 Let's play potatoes by paying fire. 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.789
 now we will want to launch the 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:28.000
 remove excess water 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:31.630
 now we're going to put the potato 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.979
 arrives in good people this verse aroma 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:41.789
 delicious that is exhaling we stir 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.789
 I'll have it all mixed up soon. 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.880
 The taste of this way that we made is 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:56.300
 marked by this we mix so we 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:00.169
 Let's put more oil and feel comfortable. 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.350
 be when you want to 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.510
 cover well of catar 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.860
 how I talked to you this many 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.139
 revenue 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.370
 This is one I lost to my family. 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.430
 always makes this our recipe, not even 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.520
 to be consumed when you do not 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.740
 We have to take time to be able to 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.650
 to penetrate the seasoning in the potato 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.650
 so it's good we do so look at us 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.550
 we took a fork and we went it was so 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.150
 without breaking it, we'll make the holes 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.710
 thus facilitating the entry of 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.110
 money in the potato 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.510
 Then we'll finish putting a 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.510
 seasoning that was in the pan 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.789
 if you own and competitive you place 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:53.539
 the sticks like this still closed the food 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.150
 so you take away and how I talked to you 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.580
 can wait for up to a week in the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.890
 olive oil in the refrigerator can not have 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.140
 that you agree you charge her with 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.100
 Accept for taking, you take only her without the 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.830
 olive oil 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.700
 Let's get it, let's open it for you. 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.700
 see how it got 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.840
 look at the point that it stays al dente 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:29.420
 it's not soup at home in the kitchen 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:32.270
 It's okay, it 's hard then this is ours. 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.090
