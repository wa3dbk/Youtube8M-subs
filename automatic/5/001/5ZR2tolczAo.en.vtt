going<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.420> get<00:00:06.600> an<00:00:06.720> optimal<00:00:07.350> pull<00:00:07.680> line<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
going to get an optimal pull line on the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.570 
going to get an optimal pull line on the
bar<00:00:09.179> if<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.750> don't<00:00:10.230> do<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.070> giving

it as you would and that's going to
teach<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.940> how<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> line<00:00:57.690> should<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> how

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
to feel the line going okay first of all

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
to feel the line going okay first of all
let's<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> couple<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.910> pull<00:01:03.300> lines

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
let's get a couple of these pull lines

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.010 
let's get a couple of these pull lines
that<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.049> wrong<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.360> look<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> look

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that are wrong and look at them and look

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
that are wrong and look at them and look
at<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.350> happens<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.299> okay<00:01:09.330> even<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:09.900> you

we set up bars at the base of the toe
for<00:02:23.780> most<00:02:23.959> people<00:02:24.439> almost<00:02:24.709> all<00:02:25.099> people<00:02:25.340> it's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
for most people almost all people it's

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.149

way<00:03:24.739> it's<00:03:25.099> here<00:03:25.609> it's<00:03:26.299> nice<00:03:26.629> turbulent<00:03:27.290> air

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
way it's here it's nice turbulent air

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.460 
way it's here it's nice turbulent air
movement<00:03:28.729> right<00:03:28.939> in<00:03:29.090> there<00:03:29.329> then<00:03:30.169> what's

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
movement right in there then what's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.009 
movement right in there then what's
going<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.709> happen<00:03:30.769> here<00:03:31.489> is<00:03:31.659> you'll<00:03:32.659> start<00:03:32.930> it

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
going to happen here is you'll start it

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.259 
going to happen here is you'll start it
you'll<00:03:36.019> sweep<00:03:36.379> it<00:03:36.650> you'll<00:03:37.430> double<00:03:37.849> knee<00:03:38.000> bend

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
you'll sweep it you'll double knee bend

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.879 
you'll sweep it you'll double knee bend
and<00:03:38.540> now<00:03:38.959> you're<00:03:39.169> in<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.409> power<00:03:39.650> position

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889

a pretty complete idea I think of how to

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.760 
a pretty complete idea I think of how to
do<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:51.009> whole<00:05:51.219> lift<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:52.690> has<00:05:53.080> got<00:05:53.379> to<00:05:53.620> be

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
do the whole lift this has got to be

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.279 
do the whole lift this has got to be
done<00:05:54.009> you're<00:05:54.370> wasting<00:05:54.940> your<00:05:54.969> time<00:05:55.300> if<00:05:55.719> you

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
done you're wasting your time if you

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.769 
done you're wasting your time if you
drive<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.979> bar<00:05:57.159> straight<00:05:57.699> off<00:05:57.909> the<00:05:58.180> floor<00:05:58.479> or

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
drive the bar straight off the floor or
