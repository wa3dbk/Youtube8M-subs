00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.640
 I wanted to make it a dragon 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250

 on the side of his mind the tattoo of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.469
 luque made for the carioca surfer to ask 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.380

 [Music] 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.400
 to act in traffic 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.210
 I mirror myself quite at that time me 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.009
 I found it very beautiful and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.110
 which also gave me a will 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.060
 very large to make the tattoo were 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.020
 more than 20 years living in the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 Santista 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.619
 first in saints later in and have in 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.899
 luque died at the age of 55 in 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.990
 small town of Cape Arraial on the river 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.780
 of January but until today he is remembered 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.580
 represents for us actuators a source 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.429
 of inspiration because he was the first 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.429
 donor who brought find tattoo on the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.830
 modern times for Brazil 50 years ago 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:45.320
 ago Ignatius met the moc in bringing 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.789
 the tattoo machine pioneered 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.179
 france saints 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.240
 it rescues a whole tradition of the old 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:57.470
 sailors from the entire photo diary 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.050
 that culture of the sailors he 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.810
 brought much evidence in saints 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.119
 happens according to tatto mix convince and the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.520
 world-renowned artist is 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.039
 honored with banners and also in this 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.270
 made by him showing the beach of 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.069
 Cable camp 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.520
 I think that this homage is not only 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.500
 for the look is a tribute to the city 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.480
 because whether or not you want the tattoo on 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.120
 brazil was born in santos 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.120
 So this homage goes to Brazil.
