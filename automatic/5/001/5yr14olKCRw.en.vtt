00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.779
 point out a sign that does not deceive 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 on it for my taste of the cmj in his 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.259
 finishes linear good vintage patar 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.080
 pandya will sing in front of kind of match he 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.050
 is evident that a speaker six old 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 support this support or barrouillet like 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.180
 if we are a spade to see and me 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 say hello on it but we are in 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 sip champagne champagne 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.030
 so can you 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 explain the concept of the path that does not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 stop bickering 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 so the idea came to me ah good with 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 the whole family to my grandfather my 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 father it's been about eight years that we have 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 decided to make a champagne 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 exception and so me it's out of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.890
 question of being an exceptional champagne 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.580
 with traditional taste is normal I 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.440
 so had the idea of ​​making a bottle a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.450
 original bottle with enough material 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.399
 noble who knew the carbon does it's 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.600
 a very strong material noble 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.860
 and are ultramodern 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 we use it today in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.549
 aerospace aerospace and especially 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.790
 in the automotive township that beauty 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.310
 is covered with this material where the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 beauty was made in butt plates with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 carbon is real carbon 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.290
 it was covered so it's a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 glass bottle covered with 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 genuine tiles he was 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.570
 inconceivable to taste everything 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.740
 carbon without the glass on the inside on 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 because otherwise I lost the name 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.710
 champagne it was for a reason of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.689
 quality is a craftsman who works 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.939
 100% manually the bottle he puts to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.080
 about eight days of agreement both at 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.470
 standard of living cement it seems to me 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.970
 so traditional nikos so that means 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 what is this traditional method 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.340
 so we do the aging is done 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.810
 old-fashioned that is to say that today 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.490
 all the bottles in cellar finally I 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 think 90% to champagne founded 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.930
 aging in range with flow rates 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580
 milk capsules 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.570
 we work in the old way 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.070
 that is, we make a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.260
 aging with plugs in 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.220
 cork is this layer in 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.220
 alliance that will give a blow 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.770
 extra to May 20 yeah that's a 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.480
 traditional method I think that 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.580
 evolution is different on the inside 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.490
 from the bottle 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.870
 after us from our side to us with my 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.540
 grandfather rona boom is discussing it and we 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.360
 think that brings a positive point to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.500
 double aging is so for 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.230
 that we decided to work as well 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
 that at the time of the blow there will be gorges 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.490
 do you have to do that at most 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.440
 three years to the advanced not a head does not 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.110
 can not go into the machine it's 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.290
 everything else while the carbon bottle is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.269
 does from a to z entirely to art and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.269
 realize completely deep
