points<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:43.440> does<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.680> mean<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
points and what does that mean that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
points and what does that mean that
means<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.579> enemies<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.570> grit<00:00:45.780> areas

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
means the enemies have little grit areas

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
means the enemies have little grit areas
that<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.440> spawn<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.309> spawn<00:00:47.700> there

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that they spawn in and they spawn there

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.420 
that they spawn in and they spawn there
no<00:00:48.030> matter<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.480> much<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.440> their<00:00:50.190> ass

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
no matter how much you're into their ass

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
no matter how much you're into their ass
is<00:00:50.730> almost<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.090> demolition<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> lot

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
is almost like demolition but it's a lot

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
is almost like demolition but it's a lot
easier<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> spawn<00:00:54.329> delay<00:00:54.510> on

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
easier because it has a spawn delay on

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.139 
easier because it has a spawn delay on
it<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.980> spawn<00:00:56.250> delay<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:56.789> actually

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it and the spawn delay is what actually

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
it and the spawn delay is what actually
keeps<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> pup<00:00:58.289> stars<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.219> game

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
keeps the pup stars out of this game

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.860 
keeps the pup stars out of this game
mode<00:00:59.699> because<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.329> an<00:01:00.449> eight-second

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
mode because it has an eight-second

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.299 
mode because it has an eight-second
spawn<00:01:01.079> delay<00:01:01.199> no<00:01:01.469> matter<00:01:01.620> how<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.890> cut<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
spawn delay no matter how you cut the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.840 
spawn delay no matter how you cut the
cake<00:01:02.809> what<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> tan<00:01:05.729> this
