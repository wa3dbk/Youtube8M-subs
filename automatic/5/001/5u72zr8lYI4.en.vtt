00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.320
 superstar again this time with 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.019
 the unboxing of the world wireless 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.139
 stadium are separated for playstation 4 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.390
 feet tripod psvita good you just 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 buy this is because to the others who 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 you were rotting 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.730
 tel aviv but already giving time that no 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.430
 happens then they were worth it and well that already this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.529
 do a work and am are the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.360
 supposedly a little better with that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.879
 I do not know if they are better than the towers 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.559
 ruiz but then we will see how not 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.440
 We tried them for a while and then with nothing to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.379
 see what he talks about as you can see here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.960
 this is the box, I think that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.920
 You have seen her here she says that well 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 where the picture comes here and here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 it comes so that they are compatible they are 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.330
 for this precision four feet trieste 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.730
 and pebbles as you can see 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.440
 Well, I have the three consoles, because 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.900
 three 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.400
 as you can see this here this give us 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.280
 the small specifications of what 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 is this the headsets as you can see are 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.960
 the 7.1 virtual surround sound something like that and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 they have custom audio mouse that there is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.600
 an application on playstation 4 that 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.340
 you can download it for me 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.110
 for we know how to make custom for 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 every game you have, it seems to me that 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.040
 the first game that has thus towards a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 original original custom is that of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.400
 sick people get tired comes with a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.830
 equalizer already pre-designed for what 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.220
 which is the game as you can see vi of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.840
 the headphones comes this one titan lÃ¶w and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:54.640
 comes between the auxiliary 3.5 mba audi 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.979
 jack for the foot is vital for another type 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.880
 of devices that have 3.5 input 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.010
 that since most do not or are 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.310
 practically all ipod cell phones 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.390
 whatever it is with input 3.5 this is 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.940
 practically be used with 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.900
 any device that has output 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.790
 3.5 audio so let's see this one 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.790
 what it contains in the box 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.960
 let's open here I have a knife 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.820
 to open it, excuse me, I do not have this 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.260
 triple or nothing the reason why not 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.510
 I'm saying because then to my channel and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.620
 I want to resume this and call already 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.210
 I'm in bed I'm going to buy 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.250
 bring this video of highest quality 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.740
 and the truth faces and this I think to enter 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 with everything that is the channel since there 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.520
 many bands that supports me and then the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.130
 that really motivated me and 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.790
 and as this hole is sorry for me 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.790
 he entered the house 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.030
 we are going to see that it has 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.130
 I repeat and is going to buy all that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 the team will put aside 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.970
 camera for 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.830
 for this 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.140
 how are you going to be able to take out the styles 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.650
 headsets already be because it is very difficult 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.650
 with a hand 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.540
 It allows 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.540
 Y 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 As you can see there is another box inside 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.930
 Box as we will see coming out of 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.400
 here although this one 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.400
 good and here it says 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.320
 and the sony playstation logo 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.110
 white 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.030
 here are the main ones that are the 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.030
 headphones 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:08.069
 for the price of 100 dollars 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.329
 I think they are very good sets 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.329
 how can you see this 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.820
 they are very light what I liked that weighs 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.760
 less than 2 pools than the others that 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.510
 which is where three are distinguished 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.210
 less heavy 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.030
 They are a little cheaper but 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.770
 but then let's see how and after 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.160
 upload a full review of what it is 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.860
 this 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.690
 of what is this one more analysis 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.270
 detailed so that you will choose if 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.260
 they buy one but for the moment here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.810
 this 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 here then we have to turn not 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.400
 selected as schalke more through 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.380
 box 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.380
 let's see what else this 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:01.319
 what he 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.319
 Well, all that is not 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:16.570
 Well, I'm here with a bag for a 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.570
 drop to bring them 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.820
 to what is presentable 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.620
 for micro and this judge and to charge them 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.200
 a normal cable that I imagine that all 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.090
 we have at home since most of 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.020
 today's devices 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.210
 they connect under a micro and the bid 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.670
 good 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.130
 and this one brings him 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:49.969
 the 3.5 audio adapter 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.799
 here is the idol 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:06:02.349
 It is everything that is in the box 

00:05:51.799 --> 00:06:02.349
 it seems that the manuals and here is 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.550
 so they can see no no does not come in 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.910
 this 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.980
 annual nothing 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:20.790
 Well this is a boxing of what it is 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.370
 helmets of the helmets to play this 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.740
 video holder 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.020
 that nor for the newest the model more 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.590
 recent but not because it was called people 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.260
 it means that he is the best rapper 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.470
 but then let's see how is this 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.320
 works and 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.670
 I'm testing them and how do I tell them 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.380

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.930
