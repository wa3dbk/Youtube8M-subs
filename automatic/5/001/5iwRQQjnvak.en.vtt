hair so that i wanted a rock for a while
and<00:00:34.289> i<00:00:34.379> did<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.339> now<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:36.179> over<00:00:36.359> it<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.899> its

back to grow my hair back out I think of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.880 
back to grow my hair back out I think of
it<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:40.019> I<00:00:40.339> think<00:00:41.339> it<00:00:41.429> has<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.609> little

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
it as a little I think it has a little

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.910 
it as a little I think it has a little
setback<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.969> grand<00:00:45.390> scheme<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.899> things<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
setback in the grand scheme of things so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
setback in the grand scheme of things so
now<00:00:47.069> I'm<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.339> on<00:00:47.399> track<00:00:47.960> before<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
now I'm back on track before I did the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
now I'm back on track before I did the
lens<00:00:49.829> check<00:00:50.069> is<00:00:50.249> pretty<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> showing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
lens check is pretty much just showing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
lens check is pretty much just showing
you<00:00:51.269> my<00:00:51.449> hair<00:00:51.749> and<00:00:51.899> you've<00:00:52.050> seen<00:00:52.460> how<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.690> goes

you my hair and you've seen how it goes

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.239 
you my hair and you've seen how it goes
every<00:00:55.170> three<00:00:55.350> months<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.069> I'm

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
every three months but this time I'm

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.979 
every three months but this time I'm
just<00:00:56.519> I'm<00:00:56.609> a<00:00:56.640> little<00:00:56.729> different<00:00:57.239> instead<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
just I'm a little different instead of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
just I'm a little different instead of
just<00:00:58.140> showing<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:58.890> saying<00:00:59.489> okay<00:00:59.999> was

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just showing you and saying okay was

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.879 
just showing you and saying okay was
here<00:01:00.389> and<00:01:00.569> I<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.229> here<00:01:01.440> I'm

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:01.889 
here and I was here and I was here I'm

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.630 
here and I was here and I was here I'm
going<00:01:02.339> to<00:01:02.460> use<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.909> trusty<00:01:03.659> dusty<00:01:04.400> tape<00:01:05.400> measure

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
going to use a trusty dusty tape measure

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.080 
going to use a trusty dusty tape measure

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I think it's a lot easier to track and a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
I think it's a lot easier to track and a
lot<00:01:09.420> more<00:01:09.560> accurate<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.100> numbers

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
lot more accurate to have some numbers

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.280 
lot more accurate to have some numbers
