is<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> pretty<00:01:51.810> fun<00:01:52.020> built<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.439> mean

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
is it was a pretty fun built I mean

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460 
is it was a pretty fun built I mean
seriously<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.259> bit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
seriously it was a little bit

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
seriously it was a little bit
challenging<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.340> too<00:01:56.640> hard<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> leg<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
challenging not too hard the leg the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.530 
challenging not too hard the leg the
legs<00:01:57.810> were<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.560> hardest<00:01:58.860> part<00:01:59.070> um

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
legs were probably the hardest part um

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.109 
legs were probably the hardest part um
it's<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.259> flimsy<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it's actually really flimsy like if you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.649 
it's actually really flimsy like if you
look<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> legs<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
look at this on the legs all they do is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.630 
look at this on the legs all they do is
flop<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.500> expect<00:02:07.799> they'll<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
flop you would expect they'll be like

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.089 
flop you would expect they'll be like
hard<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> position<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.830> full

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
hard to position and if you want it full

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.960 
hard to position and if you want it full

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
what most LEGO sets are based off like

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.460 
what most LEGO sets are based off like
you're<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.160> hundreds<00:03:51.760> juice<00:03:52.630> minus<00:03:53.019> 20

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
you're in the hundreds juice minus 20

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.370 
you're in the hundreds juice minus 20
and<00:03:53.739> that's<00:03:54.360> rounded<00:03:55.360> up<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.170> this<00:03:56.320> is

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
and that's rounded up but and this is

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.699 
and that's rounded up but and this is
ten<00:03:57.010> dollars<00:03:57.400> more<00:03:57.610> than<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.940> should<00:03:58.180> be<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:59.440> I

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
ten dollars more than it should be but I

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.220
