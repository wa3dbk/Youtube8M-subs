00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
hanging around the hospital trying to be

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.679 
hanging around the hospital trying to be
useful<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.160> then<00:00:24.550> September<00:00:25.210> 11th<00:00:25.510> happened

often<00:00:30.910> running<00:00:31.119> that<00:00:32.110> morning<00:00:32.559> so<00:00:32.710> that<00:00:32.830> was

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
often running that morning so that was

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.259 
often running that morning so that was
my<00:00:33.040> first<00:00:33.220> day<00:00:33.400> as<00:00:33.519> a<00:00:33.580> doctor<00:00:33.910> here

my first day as a doctor here

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.539 
my first day as a doctor here
I<00:00:34.299> first<00:00:35.260> developed<00:00:35.680> an<00:00:35.769> interest<00:00:36.010> in<00:00:36.190> trauma

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:36.549 
I first developed an interest in trauma

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.329 
I first developed an interest in trauma
when<00:00:37.059> I<00:00:37.089> was<00:00:37.299> a<00:00:37.330> surgical<00:00:37.839> resident<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:39.129> was

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
when I was a surgical resident and I was

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.539 
when I was a surgical resident and I was
learning<00:00:39.580> to<00:00:39.760> operate<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:41.199> saw<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:42.040> couple

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:42.549 
learning to operate and I saw a couple

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:44.460 
learning to operate and I saw a couple
surgeons<00:00:43.150> that<00:00:43.239> were<00:00:43.420> doing<00:00:43.659> operations<00:00:44.229> and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
surgeons that were doing operations and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.500 
surgeons that were doing operations and
kind<00:00:44.650> of<00:00:44.739> got<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:44.979> over<00:00:45.100> their<00:00:45.220> head<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:45.879> I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
kind of got in over their head and I

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.299 
kind of got in over their head and I
watched<00:00:46.780> them<00:00:47.049> get<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.229> little<00:00:47.470> bit<00:00:47.589> scared<00:00:48.010> and

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
watched them get a little bit scared and

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.289 
watched them get a little bit scared and
I<00:00:48.460> vowed<00:00:48.790> I<00:00:49.210> can<00:00:49.930> never<00:00:50.260> be<00:00:50.440> scared<00:00:50.500> like<00:00:50.920> that

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
I vowed I can never be scared like that

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.009 
I vowed I can never be scared like that
after<00:00:52.299> that<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.900> became<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:55.390> drawn<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.720> the

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
after that I became really drawn to the

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.770 
after that I became really drawn to the
idea<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.699> operating<00:00:57.699> all<00:00:58.059> over<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.629> body

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
idea of operating all over the body

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.750 
idea of operating all over the body
which<00:00:59.170> if<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.409> think<00:00:59.589> about<00:00:59.769> it<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.250> not<00:01:00.519> that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
which if you think about it is not that

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.149 
which if you think about it is not that
common<00:01:01.119> in<00:01:01.510> modern<00:01:02.260> surgery<00:01:02.710> typically

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159

the heart and the kidney and the
intestine<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:12.100> know<00:01:12.220> on<00:01:12.310> in<00:01:12.550> one<00:01:12.730> night<00:01:12.940> maybe

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
intestine you know on in one night maybe

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.000 
intestine you know on in one night maybe
on<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.540> same<00:01:13.720> patient<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:14.980> a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
on the same patient and that is a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.580 
on the same patient and that is a
challenge<00:01:15.400> that's<00:01:16.260> scary<00:01:17.260> when<00:01:17.470> you're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
challenge that's scary when you're

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.650 
challenge that's scary when you're
starting<00:01:17.830> out<00:01:18.130> but<00:01:18.910> it<00:01:19.060> tends<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.330> keep<00:01:19.540> you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
starting out but it tends to keep you

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.450 
starting out but it tends to keep you
sharp<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.350> ultimately<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:21.130> very

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
sharp and it ultimately is very

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.020 
sharp and it ultimately is very
satisfying<00:01:22.170> throughout<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> career<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:24.030> believe

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
satisfying throughout a career I believe

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.830 
satisfying throughout a career I believe
that<00:01:25.450> doing<00:01:26.350> trauma<00:01:26.830> care<00:01:27.220> gives<00:01:28.060> trauma

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
that doing trauma care gives trauma

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.770 
that doing trauma care gives trauma
surgeons<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.680> particular<00:01:30.370> opportunity<00:01:31.120> to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
surgeons a particular opportunity to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.050 
surgeons a particular opportunity to
participate<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.800> something<00:01:33.520> that's<00:01:33.760> sacred

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
participate in something that's sacred

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
participate in something that's sacred
and<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.840> think<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.260> come<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.680> work<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:37.060> do

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
and I think to come to work and to do

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.710 
and I think to come to work and to do
the<00:01:37.690> very<00:01:38.080> best<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.680> can<00:01:38.920> for<00:01:39.220> somebody<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.820> an

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the very best you can for somebody is an

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560 
the very best you can for somebody is an
opportunity<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.710> bring<00:01:41.980> out<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.940> best<00:01:43.150> parts

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
opportunity to bring out the best parts

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.630 
opportunity to bring out the best parts
of<00:01:43.690> ourselves<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.560> it's<00:01:44.740> something<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:45.550> we

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
of ourselves and it's something that we

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.700 
of ourselves and it's something that we
may<00:01:45.760> not<00:01:45.880> be<00:01:45.940> able<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.210> muster<00:01:46.720> outside<00:01:47.530> of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
may not be able to muster outside of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.560 
may not be able to muster outside of
work<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.340> environment<00:01:48.820> supports<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
work but the environment supports it the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.660 
work but the environment supports it the
culture<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:49.990> MedStar<00:01:50.560> supports<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.490> and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
culture of MedStar supports it and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.240 
culture of MedStar supports it and
that's<00:01:52.450> important<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:52.930> me<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.320> do<00:01:53.830> get<00:01:54.220> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that's important to me I do get a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.640 
that's important to me I do get a
certain<00:01:54.550> feeling<00:01:54.820> when<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.210> look<00:01:55.930> up<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.590> my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
certain feeling when I look up in my
