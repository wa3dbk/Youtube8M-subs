00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.879
 well 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello friends with you again i am denis 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 Burhaev 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 and wanted to share one such 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.410
 as an interesting consideration 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 life observations which here 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 I had it there after the next 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 communication there with my clients that is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.170
 the client left as if we were there before 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.309
 discussed let's say so his questions 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 everyday that's when it means I left 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.829
 thought about what's life like there 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.680
 so interesting it turns out somehow here 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 I have such an observation 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.250
 that in life there are generally two such 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 here 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.789
 large enough categories of men 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.030
 there is the first category of men and those 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.920
 who are successful with women here 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.609
 and the second category is a man who 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.870
 enjoy success with money that's what 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.280
 the funny thing is somehow these categories 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.790
 don't particularly intersect here and life 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 in general, from the dynamics of real life 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 show very different how would 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.119
 interesting results ie first here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 category of men who use 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 success with women they usually here in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.810
 dynamics well, that is, age cease 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.770
 enjoy success with women 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 and here is not successful money 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.680
 that is, they somehow here initially having 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 really such a high start start 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.020
 conditions of the opposite sex 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.020
 less in life they eke out 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.780
 gray existence quite well here and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.570
 the second category of men are those who 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.570
 initially women had no success here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.210
 they 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.140
 very often, well, not that hour but 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.830
 quite often 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.950
 here can be narrow in money but the fact is, 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.510
 they get in life as it were 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.030
 earn there certain finances 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
 Well, that is, a certain amount of ideas to them 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.959
 lucky with money 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.760
 Here, but less like luck in personal 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.070
 life but practice is such a life and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.160
 observation shows that with 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.330
 time how would they start 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.239
 enjoy success and have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.560
 the opposite sex that is and in this 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.430
 communication as if I had a question 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.989
 I have to you as an audience I am interested 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
 find out whether it is right at all 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.140
 saying my life observation is because 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.170
 what is it that something tells me that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.440
 in fact, about a similar situation 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 should be observed in women but in 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.760
 respect of men and money that is more 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.799
 In addition, I would say that something to me 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.650
 suggests that there is some such common 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.510
 trend in general here in human 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.380
 life regardless of sex there 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 accessories 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.200
 that's to say the next thing you can 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.170
 there are generally two such 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.799
 basically let's say so excellent groups 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 people different from each other that is 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.660
 The first category of people are those who 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.610
 lucky here in personal life that is 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.860
 Initially, as they are such 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.500
 lucky star were born here 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.900
 the second category of people are those who 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.209
 Lucky for money 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.360
 life somehow well some 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.310
 drawdown something tells me that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.640
 there is such a moment the sky was 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 It is interesting to listen to exactly your point 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.010
 view on this and not just yours 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.470
 point of view would be very cool if 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.959
 you told for example your story 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.690
 life or say if you don't consider 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.290
 my life is quite rich enough 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.810
 would 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.819
 on components to various interesting 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.560
 here you can basically tell us 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.840
 history of your friends or acquaintances 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.959
 his friends here but so that it 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.849
 still it was but more or less 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.519
 at least some credibility because 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.890
 if you talk about how 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.980
 mean there your grand-nephew there 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.049
 great uncle came to success this is not 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.789
 absolutely that that is all would like to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.570
 about close relatives of friends 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.470
 familiar 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 so it would be interesting to discuss 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.830
 this subject here is the more that it has 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.750
 direct relation, as it were, and 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.810
 to the matrix and to the social 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.110
 programming in general and to this 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.080
 concept as here exergy 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.789
 component in the life of the well that is where 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.160
 the man is sending more 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.380
 I would like to know my efforts here 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.810
 your opinion on this matter hear 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.099
 Feedback is generally waiting for your 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.099
 comments thanks
