talk<00:00:14.740> about<00:00:14.860> when<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.790> power<00:00:15.969> disc<00:00:16.240> allows

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:35.500 

the<00:00:20.420> oxygen<00:00:20.780> to<00:00:21.050> survive<00:00:21.340> so

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.709 

straw<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:35.870> blow<00:00:36.019> into<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.649> water<00:00:36.859> scene

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.430 

which<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.989> water<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.710> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.330 

should<00:00:49.900> show<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.200> how<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.380> do<00:00:50.590> what<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:50.920> do<00:00:51.040> so

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
should show you how to do what you do so

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.970 
should show you how to do what you do so
if<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.270> use<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.630> straw<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.110> just<00:00:53.440> blow<00:00:53.620> into<00:00:53.800> it

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
if you use a straw you just blow into it

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.500 
if you use a straw you just blow into it
like<00:00:54.130> this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.630 

oh<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.079> should<00:01:00.469> do<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.129> about<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.429> minute

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
oh you should do it for about a minute

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.960 
oh you should do it for about a minute
or<00:01:01.910> something<00:01:02.329> just<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.899> try

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
or something just to try

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.240 
or something just to try
excited<00:01:05.870> get<00:01:06.530> some<00:01:06.680> oxygen<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.570> spoon

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
excited get some oxygen with the spoon

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.800 
excited get some oxygen with the spoon
you<00:01:10.250> could<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:10.580> push<00:01:10.910> it<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.180> this

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.840 

lettuce<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.560> produce<00:01:14.800> as<00:01:15.010> many<00:01:15.310> bubbles<00:01:15.610> as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
lettuce and produce as many bubbles as

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.410 
lettuce and produce as many bubbles as
straw

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.570 

you<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:21.290> even<00:01:21.409> have<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.680> filter<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.250> this

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
you can even have a filter like this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.990 
you can even have a filter like this
doesn't<00:01:23.060> mean<00:01:23.510> any<00:01:23.840> electricity<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.550> it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
doesn't mean any electricity and it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.820 
doesn't mean any electricity and it
produces<00:01:26.570> bubbles<00:01:27.380> which<00:01:27.950> will<00:01:28.310> help<00:01:28.780> oxygen

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
produces bubbles which will help oxygen

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.100 
produces bubbles which will help oxygen
which<00:01:31.340> will

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
which will

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.770 
which will
you<00:01:33.620> can<00:01:33.770> purchase<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.460> filter<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.060> it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you can purchase a filter like this it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.660 
you can purchase a filter like this it
will<00:01:36.320> produce<00:01:36.530> my<00:01:36.800> oxygen<00:01:37.130> into<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.400> water

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
will produce my oxygen into the water

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
will produce my oxygen into the water
and<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.030> don't<00:01:38.240> need<00:01:38.360> any<00:01:38.600> electricity<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
and you don't need any electricity the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
and you don't need any electricity the
reason<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.170> want<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.470> aerate<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:43.010> water<00:01:43.220> is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
reason you want to aerate the water is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.200 
reason you want to aerate the water is
because<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:45.560> bacteria<00:01:45.890> need<00:01:46.640> oxygen<00:01:46.760> to

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
because the bacteria need oxygen to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.750 
because the bacteria need oxygen to
survive<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:48.230> if<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:49.070> there's<00:01:49.370> not<00:01:49.550> enough

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
survive so if if there's not enough

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.840 
survive so if if there's not enough
oxygen<00:01:49.910> they<00:01:50.479> will<00:01:50.690> die<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.350> your<00:01:52.160> fish<00:01:52.370> could

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
oxygen they will die and your fish could

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.109 
oxygen they will die and your fish could
also<00:01:53.000> get<00:01:53.330> kind<00:01:53.630> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
also get kind of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.060 
also get kind of
of<00:01:54.390> oxygen

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.460 

so<00:01:57.520> ammonia<00:01:58.030> will<00:01:58.180> start<00:01:58.390> building<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:58.810> of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
so ammonia will start building up of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.740 
so ammonia will start building up of
course<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.280> power<00:02:00.550> might<00:02:00.850> only<00:02:01.030> be<00:02:01.270> up<00:02:01.420> for<00:02:01.450> a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
course the power might only be up for a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.870 
course the power might only be up for a
few<00:02:01.960> hours<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.130> back<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.400> your<00:02:03.460> page<00:02:03.640> will

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
few hours but it back to your page will

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.230 
few hours but it back to your page will
take<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> few<00:02:04.360> hours<00:02:04.420> until<00:02:04.810> they<00:02:05.050> get
