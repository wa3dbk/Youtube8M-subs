00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.900 

size<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.690> 110<00:00:09.690> centimeters<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.250> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
size is 110 centimeters and just want to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:22.550 
size is 110 centimeters and just want to
show<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.380> looks<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.790> real<00:00:21.560> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
show you how it looks in a real this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
show you how it looks in a real this
part<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:24.439> you<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.090> set<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.660> kind<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
part can you have in a set this kind of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.640 
part can you have in a set this kind of
productor<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.560> kind<00:00:31.560> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
productor I think it's for kind of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
productor I think it's for kind of
bracket<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> wanted<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> use<00:00:33.750> more<00:00:34.050> than

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bracket when you wanted to use more than

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
bracket when you wanted to use more than
just<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.309> lnb<00:00:36.350> without<00:00:37.350> fitting<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just the one lnb without fitting the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.330 
just the one lnb without fitting the
statistic<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.180> keep<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:40.190> when<00:00:41.190> you're

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
statistic is it keep on when you're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.910 
statistic is it keep on when you're
using<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:45.559> space<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
using just you can use that space and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.270 
using just you can use that space and
through<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> cables<00:00:48.270> inside<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.530> they

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
through the cables inside and then they

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
through the cables inside and then they
won't<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.910> through<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
won't go just through all this bit I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.270 
won't go just through all this bit I
think<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:54.110> forgot<00:00:55.110> two<00:00:55.379> small<00:00:55.710> holes<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
think I'm out forgot two small holes and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.459 
think I'm out forgot two small holes and
then<00:00:56.730> using<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> see

then using it because I'm as you can see
I'm<00:00:58.590> using<00:00:58.620> three<00:00:59.160> three<00:00:59.940> cables<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.110> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I'm using three three cables so but it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
I'm using three three cables so but it's
really<00:01:04.409> nice<00:01:04.650> feature<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:08.119> fixing

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

and<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:15.160> bracket<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.970> can<00:01:16.210> put<00:01:16.420> upside<00:01:17.290> down

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
and this bracket you can put upside down

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.749 
and this bracket you can put upside down
and<00:01:17.890> then<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.610> can<00:01:18.970> have<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> different<00:01:21.540> agree

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
if you need to put satellite is really

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:48.580 
if you need to put satellite is really
really<00:01:28.299> high<00:01:28.600> or<00:01:28.630> really<00:01:29.110> really<00:01:29.289> know
