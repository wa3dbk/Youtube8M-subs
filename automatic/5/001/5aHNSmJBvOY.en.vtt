00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
trick here is of course to avoid this by
you<00:02:40.360> ones<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:44.349> definitely<00:02:44.799> want<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> get

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
you ones and you definitely want to get

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.850 
you ones and you definitely want to get
those<00:02:45.700> little<00:02:46.540> ones<00:02:47.080> because<00:02:47.319> they're<00:02:47.709> worth

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
those little ones because they're worth

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.520 
those little ones because they're worth
a<00:02:48.010> lot<00:02:48.159> more<00:02:48.190> points<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.900> want<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.319> as

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
a lot more points and you want to go as

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.520 
a lot more points and you want to go as
fast<00:02:50.739> as<00:02:50.950> possible<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:55.019> because<00:02:56.019> when

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
fast as possible to because because when

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.410 
fast as possible to because because when
you<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.129> end<00:02:57.370> here<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:57.909> you<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.150> fast

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
you get to the end here if you go fast

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.110 
you get to the end here if you go fast
enough<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:59.319> get<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.829> more<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:03.909> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
enough you get a lot more right here a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.910 
enough you get a lot more right here a
couple<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.870> them<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.410> like<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> whole

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
couple of them and you get like a whole

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.130 
couple of them and you get like a whole
you<00:03:06.879> know<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> whole<00:03:07.180> thing<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.599> filled<00:03:07.900> with

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you know the whole thing is filled with

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.539 
you know the whole thing is filled with
those<00:03:08.319> things<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.799> are<00:03:08.920> worth<00:03:09.040> points<00:03:09.459> so

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
those things that are worth points so

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.099 
those things that are worth points so
you<00:03:09.579> do<00:03:09.700> want<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:10.180> fast<00:03:10.329> as<00:03:10.540> possible<00:03:11.079> so

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
you do want to go as fast as possible so

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.289 
you do want to go as fast as possible so
you<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.440> get<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.790> part<00:03:13.060> that'll

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
you can get to that that part that'll

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.490 
you can get to that that part that'll
give<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:14.410> lot<00:03:15.400> more<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.540> grab<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.140> give<00:03:17.409> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
give you a lot more to grab and give you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.949 
give you a lot more to grab and give you
more<00:03:17.709> waves<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.120> did<00:03:19.239> take<00:03:19.269> me<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> couple<00:03:19.629> of

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
more waves so it did take me a couple of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.630 
more waves so it did take me a couple of
tries<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.890> kept<00:03:21.099> running<00:03:21.280> into<00:03:21.519> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
tries because I kept running into the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.349 
tries because I kept running into the
spiky<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.810> trick<00:03:23.079> really<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.709> just

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
spiky one so the trick really is to just

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.259 
spiky one so the trick really is to just
not<00:03:25.359> hit<00:03:25.569> those<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:27.310> as<00:03:27.430> easy<00:03:27.609> as<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.819> right

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
not hit those just as easy as that right

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.050 
not hit those just as easy as that right
oh<00:03:28.920> yeah<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.129> was<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.579> was<00:03:30.670> actually<00:03:30.760> pretty

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
oh yeah it was it was actually pretty

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270 
oh yeah it was it was actually pretty

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
actually pretty well it's a kind of a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.270 
actually pretty well it's a kind of a
nice<00:03:35.829> test<00:03:36.129> of<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.650> yeah<00:03:38.739> that'll<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.069> it

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
nice test of that but yeah that'll be it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.930 
nice test of that but yeah that'll be it
for<00:03:39.669> this<00:03:40.120> video<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.599> short<00:03:40.930> one<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.700> gives

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
for this video this short one that gives

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.110 
for this video this short one that gives
us<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.329> star<00:03:43.900> number<00:03:44.109> 36<00:03:44.919> and<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.760> completes

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
us a star number 36 and it completes

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.390 
us a star number 36 and it completes
