00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.260 

redneck<00:01:05.650> up<00:01:05.830> away<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.159> blatant<00:01:06.640> ripoff<00:01:06.670> of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
redneck up away is a blatant ripoff of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.539 
redneck up away is a blatant ripoff of
monopolies<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.259> essentially<00:01:09.040> has<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
monopolies that essentially has the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.880 
monopolies that essentially has the
exact<00:01:10.090> same<00:01:10.180> rules<00:01:10.630> as<00:01:11.049> far<00:01:11.350> as<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.710> tell

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
exact same rules as far as I can tell

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.010 
exact same rules as far as I can tell
with<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.070> few<00:01:12.340> changes<00:01:12.580> for<00:01:13.450> instance<00:01:13.479> when<00:01:13.899> you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
with a few changes for instance when you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.920 
with a few changes for instance when you
roll<00:01:14.229> dice<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:14.799> double<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> roll<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.509> think

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
roll dice you double the roll I think

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.749 
roll dice you double the roll I think
that<00:01:17.110> helps<00:01:17.439> make<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> game<00:01:18.040> even<00:01:18.340> longer<00:01:18.610> I

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
that helps make the game even longer I

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.029 
that helps make the game even longer I
think<00:01:19.149> because<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.619> get<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.830> go<00:01:20.920> around

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
think because you get to go around

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.760 
think because you get to go around
farther<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.789> when<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.720> land<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.200> properties

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
farther and when you land on properties

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.999 
farther and when you land on properties
which<00:01:24.039> I<00:01:24.280> mean<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.299> mean<00:01:26.200> let's<00:01:26.799> take<00:01:26.979> a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
which I mean this is I mean let's take a

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.289 
which I mean this is I mean let's take a
look<00:01:27.280> at<00:01:27.369> some<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.610> these<00:01:27.670> properties<00:01:27.939> because

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
look at some of these properties because

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.850 
look at some of these properties because
this<00:01:28.539> is<00:01:28.659> where<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.960> humor<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.680> game

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
this is where the humor of the game

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.859 
this is where the humor of the game
appears<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.060> see<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.509> we<00:01:31.689> have

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
okay now let's take a look at the bad

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.750 
okay now let's take a look at the bad
things<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.709> rules<00:03:27.920> are<00:03:28.099> horribly<00:03:28.489> written

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
things the rules are horribly written

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280 
things the rules are horribly written

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
playa so that I mean I assume will help

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.470 
playa so that I mean I assume will help
me<00:03:33.620> get<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.099> humor<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.670> game<00:03:34.879> but<00:03:35.299> they're

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
me get the humor of the game but they're

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.640 
me get the humor of the game but they're
very<00:03:35.780> poorly<00:03:36.140> written

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
very poorly written

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.680 
very poorly written
there's<00:03:36.920> even<00:03:37.579> spelling<00:03:38.090> mistakes<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.599> then

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
there's even spelling mistakes and then

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.890 
there's even spelling mistakes and then
maybe<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:39.140> supposed<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.440> be<00:03:39.500> thematic<00:03:40.900> so

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
maybe that's supposed to be thematic so

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.890 
maybe that's supposed to be thematic so
let's<00:03:42.500> think<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.340> assume<00:03:43.760> here<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.659> we're

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
let's think and assume here that we're

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.869 
let's think and assume here that we're
taking<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.260> look<00:03:45.349> at<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.530> game<00:03:45.829> as<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.189> game<00:03:46.549> itself
