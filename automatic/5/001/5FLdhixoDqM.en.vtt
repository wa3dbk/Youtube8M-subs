00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.490 
discussion we need to have at a later
time<00:03:58.850> because<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.570> think<00:03:59.630> we<00:03:59.989> worry<00:04:00.230> too<00:04:00.470> much

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500

about<00:04:00.680> standards<00:04:01.780> but<00:04:04.269> it's<00:04:05.269> just<00:04:05.480> what

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
about standards but it's just what

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.140 
about standards but it's just what
people<00:04:05.600> start<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.709> guess<00:04:07.640> it's<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.880> point

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
people start so I guess it's a point

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.040 
people start so I guess it's a point
that<00:04:08.390> needs<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.870> be<00:04:09.700> addressed<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:10.970> if<00:04:11.269> you're

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
that needs to be addressed so if you're

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.449 
that needs to be addressed so if you're
looking<00:04:12.170> for<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.590> curriculum<00:04:13.040> that's<00:04:13.250> going<00:04:13.400> to

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
dollars per month I think there's a

dollars per month I think there's a
small<00:05:12.470> discount<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:13.099> have<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.310> second<00:05:13.789> your

curriculums over the years and you just

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.939 
curriculums over the years and you just
really<00:05:16.009> can't<00:05:16.220> beat<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.639> price<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.919> what<00:05:18.919> I

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
really can't beat the price of it what I

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.820 
really can't beat the price of it what I
like<00:05:19.250> about<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:20.810> online<00:05:21.380> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
like about it is that it's online and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.250 
like about it is that it's online and
it's<00:05:22.180> interactive<00:05:24.970> for<00:05:25.970> me<00:05:26.180> when<00:05:26.780> we<00:05:26.810> start<00:05:27.169> at

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
it's interactive for me when we start at

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.399 
it's interactive for me when we start at
homeschooling<00:05:27.860> for<00:05:28.789> many<00:05:29.000> years<00:05:29.409> our

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
homeschooling for many years our

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.170 
homeschooling for many years our
children<00:05:30.919> had<00:05:31.130> been<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.370> computers<00:05:31.849> our

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
children had been on computers our

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.170 
children had been on computers our
children<00:05:32.570> were<00:05:32.780> practically<00:05:33.260> born<00:05:33.770> with<00:05:34.070> a

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
children were practically born with a

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.839 
children were practically born with a
keyboard<00:05:35.180> mouse<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:36.470> know<00:05:36.620> in<00:05:36.919> their<00:05:37.310> hands

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
keyboard mouse you know in their hands

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.210 
keyboard mouse you know in their hands
and<00:05:38.000> so<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.940> wanted<00:05:40.940> their<00:05:41.449> homeschooling<00:05:42.220> to

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
and so I wanted their homeschooling to

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.520 
and so I wanted their homeschooling to
keep<00:05:43.460> going<00:05:43.909> in<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.180> direction<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:45.199> being

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
keep going in that direction of being

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.680 
keep going in that direction of being
internet-based<00:05:46.070> because<00:05:46.699> they<00:05:46.849> were<00:05:46.909> really

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
internet-based because they were really

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.189 
internet-based because they were really
comfortable<00:05:48.020> with<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.810> they<00:05:51.050> would

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
comfortable with it and they would

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.110 
comfortable with it and they would
probably<00:05:51.770> pay<00:05:52.280> more<00:05:52.550> attention<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.940> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
probably pay more attention to the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.899 
probably pay more attention to the
computer<00:05:53.570> than<00:05:53.720> they<00:05:53.900> would<00:05:54.139> pay<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.039> me<00:05:55.400> at

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
computer than they would pay to me at

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.850 
computer than they would pay to me at
some<00:05:56.570> times<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.320> so<00:05:57.979> when<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.520> discovered<00:05:59.860> time

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
some times and so when I discovered time

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.330 
some times and so when I discovered time
for<00:06:01.159> learning<00:06:01.280> I<00:06:01.729> knew<00:06:02.090> I<00:06:02.120> had<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.389> great<00:06:02.659> match
