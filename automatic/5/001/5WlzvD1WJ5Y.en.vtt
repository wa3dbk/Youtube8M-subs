00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.580
 aboard the jaguar xfr and sports break 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 today actually we have one and it's a 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.930
 little bit special we are on a 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.410
 toe fire on the occasion of the launch of 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.090
 this break and the first ultra break 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.089
 jaguar athlete of his history 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.089
 so that's welcome and appreciated 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.400
 you see we have a country because they 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.289
 not unleash all of that on another fire 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.320
 big and give it 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.310
 fouad autumn loto power 550 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.630
 horses 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.590
 and especially 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.590
 the difficulty of the route 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.210
 she's alive 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.950
 so this without noise 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.370
 but 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.440
 it's a lot of jerking for a break 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 amazing after it's sure we feel 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.520
 the weight clearly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520
 she was doing 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.480
 and so we find the compressor v8 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.440
 a simple 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 duration 505 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.859
 which are requested 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859
 it should change with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.120
 no problem 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.930
 but it's 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.930
 is going to be signed floating 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.940
 damn well 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.900
 3 10 2 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.900
 direction is not exceptional 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 we got a little too light 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.650
 it is true that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.730
 a report again a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.690
 nobody 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.690
 it is 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 the time is clearly in terms of 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 dynamic one rs 6 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.650
 but that's sure in terms of fun 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.190
 it's as fun as a propulsion class 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 g 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.750
 even we 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.450
 a friend who locks a suspense 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 and it's with 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.770
 to these reports also more 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.510
 we still have cash movements 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.140
 have you appointed 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.140
 and so 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 show me 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.819
 agile 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.510
 g 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.840
 no time and 6 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.739
 it takes 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.739
 the famous carousel 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.420
 before we have one of the chefs 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.420
 developers 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 from jaguar who work 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.780
 so we can 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 parker actually and who knows res 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.400
 and successful rhythmic 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.400
 and that is not easy to follow but 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.090
 it's daring to have put a two-wagon 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.020
 tons on a toe fire for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.410
 temptation 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.410
 Bravo 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.349
 nor carousel too not too fast 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.349
 to be ejected in particular 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.290
 and we 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.620
 who starts the long straight 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.670
 this is for this embedded tour 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.050
 xf sport break which is not the best 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.210
 in its category but still 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.520
 very charismatic almost as fun 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.190
 that one of 63 propulsion is missing a 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.500
 little noise my 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.100
 and it's still a car 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.260
 well balanced fun after it's not at 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.220
 level of the best but spent a sacred 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.220
 moment at his wheel
