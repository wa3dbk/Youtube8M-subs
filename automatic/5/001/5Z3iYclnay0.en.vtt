00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:08.063
 We are looking for people who want to not only create something new, 

00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:13.076
 but also to work in a well-coordinated team. 

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:19.215
 Common aspirations are the basis of our work and our company itself. 

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:23.126
 We are united by the attitude to work, some established traditions. 

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:26.982
 Need to work with full dedication. Work conscientiously. 

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:31.919
 We follow the rules that are engraved on the orc statue near the main office. 

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:36.965
 All our projects are made with love down to the smallest detail. 

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.424
 When both you and all your colleagues strive to give everything, 

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:46.694
 then the quality is constantly increasing. These are wonderful conditions for creativity. 

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:51.458
 We need people who are always striving for new heights. 

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:57.001
 and, having achieved success, do not stop on the reached. 

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.310
 I think Blizzard has something special. 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.437
 We have all the resources that large companies have, 

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:08.324
 and at the same time - focus and enthusiasm, 

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:11.613
 how usually only small studios are different. 

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.485
 Of course, we have greatly grown, even built a small town, 

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.880
 but I see that all these people really love games. They are here to create them. 

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.013
 We all want to give players awesome games, 

00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:26.403
 in which we ourselves would be interesting to play. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.461
 We get great pleasure from their creation 

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.132
 and at the same time everyone contributes to the common cause. 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.072
 These are optimal conditions for creative activity. 

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:46.767
 We are engaged in creativity, not only artists and musicians. 

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.966
 All departments of Blizzard are somehow involved in game development. 

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:53.439
 This is not to say that I am developing directly, 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.236
 but I really feel involved in the process. 

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.120
 Here everyone shares his ideas 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.116
 and not always the best deals come from the developers themselves. 

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:05.989
 And this is great. 

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:14.322
 This is a very powerful incentive - to feel that your support is needed. 

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:18.629
 In the credits for each of our games it is written: “Game Development: Blizzard Entertainment”. 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.127
 It is true, the whole team really worked on them. 

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:23.433
 We appreciate people who aspire to work in a team. 

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.471
 Today, you're helping someone else do something better 

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:28.315
 and tomorrow this man will help you. 

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.157
 And together we achieve the best results. 

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:35.080
 It is important not only to create game mechanics, but also to cause real emotions. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.314
 The game should tell a story that is close and understandable to people 

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:42.930
 living in various parts of the world. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.601
 When so many people come together in unison, it is worth a lot. 

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.263
 It's a pleasure to create something 

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:56.797
 that like millions of people around the world. 

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:58.900
 Yes, this is where dreams become reality. 

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:08.202
 In Blizzard always try to attract gifted people. 

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:12.956
 Here they can interact, communicate, learn from each other ... 

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:15.918
 Our employees have great opportunities for growth: 

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:19.129
 they can undergo training in various fields 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.780
 be it with programs or time management skills. 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.039
 “Blizzard Academy” is a unique thing in the gaming industry. 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:32.785
 We give employees the opportunity to continuously improve their skills. 

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.845
 together to create the best games. 

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:39.616
 Our employees are our main resource. 

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.466
 and we try to help them in all ways. 

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:46.865
 Step by step, we take each undertaking to a new level. 

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.446
 People come to work and know 

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:53.536
 what they can do, experiment, 

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:58.324
 try new ... 

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:01.034
 We are just ... a company of enthusiasts. 

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:08.195
 In the office, I can really be myself. This is my second home. 

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:12.443
 It's easy for me to talk to anyone, no matter if I know this person or not, 

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.836
 and we will immediately find a common language. 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.979
 When I'm at work, it seems to me that I spend time with friends. 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.569
 It’s so great when it’s pleasant to work and rest with colleagues. 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.568
 We are all so different here. 

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:38.173
 Our games are incredibly successful. Agree, it is inspiring. 

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:42.644
 Everything we do stirs the hearts of millions 

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:46.223
 but at the same time, millions of people are very strict about us. 

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:50.197
 Playing something with friends, you try to beat them, 

00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:53.008
 as far as possible, without breaking the rules. 

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.470
 And we are competing with other game manufacturers. 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.053
 How do we see our company in the future? How do we want to live and work? 

00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:03.073
 I want to not just work in a company leading in my field. 

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.499
 It’s important for me that our achievements be inseparable from the realization that 

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:09.294
 that they are honest. 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.834
 I don't just like my job, I really believe in what I do, 

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.160
 into what we all do. 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.412
 Why Blizzard? It's like asking why you want to work. 

00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:22.256
 over the Apollo flight program or become an astronaut. 

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:27.468
 Perhaps from the outside we look a bit unusual, frightening ... 

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:31.090
 But this threshold is not crossed by geniuses, but by ordinary people. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.149
 If we really achieved something, all this is due to the fact that we 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:41.828
 we help each other to conquer new heights, for these are our common aspirations. 

00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:47.209
 After all, friends help each other. And for me this is important.
