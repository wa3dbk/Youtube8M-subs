or without the grip so

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.610 
or without the grip so
in<00:06:41.460> my<00:06:41.610> opinion<00:06:41.850> it's<00:06:42.240> useless<00:06:42.540> I<00:06:42.990> never<00:06:43.350> use

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.480 
it I would not recommend you use it I
think<00:06:45.479> it's<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.660> waste<00:06:45.810> of<00:06:46.020> an<00:06:46.139> attachment<00:06:46.490> but

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
think it's a waste of an attachment but
