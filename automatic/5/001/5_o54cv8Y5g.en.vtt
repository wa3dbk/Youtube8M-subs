00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.150
 on the television of these games perched 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.510
 in tomato sauce that are very easy 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 to do but I'm really looking forward to 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.730
 start frying onions was to add garlic 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.590
 chilito 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.750
 please sir 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.120
 the sidereal space 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590
 and cumin 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.550
 well I have a little broth to move 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 because here it is sticking and I do not 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.330
 like that much sticking things to 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.130
 that used my cante to lose weight 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.580
 let's add the tomatoes heart 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.580
 min 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 the eggs are I lower them with 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.840
 exactly 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.479
 and this dish I'm doing during 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.429
 the program I want you to see how 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.420
 will start to change the color of 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.390
 tomato 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.540
 and we are going to press it and since we have 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.210
 a sauce I will add the eggs and the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.130
 let's support this is going to be is that 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.680
 we have some delicious poached eggs 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.140
 in tomato sauce cooked potatoes about 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.520
 10 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes for 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.060
 to do it we have to accompany coriander 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 and parsley so that the two and nothing true 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.780
 no parsley 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.040
 well let's mix perfectly 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 let's leave it over medium heat and in 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.510
 how much it breaks the boiling point and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.400
 perfectly cooked tomatoes that 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.800
 have both the merits and then we're going to 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.230
 add that because it looks like they are feta 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.490
 strict talks about having at home and 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.740
 we will accompany it with some delicious 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.510
 although they go spit I was afraid what we're going 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.869
 to do that is shown on tantito 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.869
 oil 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.950
 and we are going to add so much salt 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 like pizza exactly to accompany 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.250
 these delicious poached eggs will 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.260
 it seems to me very well minimal is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.660
