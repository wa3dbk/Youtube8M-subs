 [Music] 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 Dear welcome friends I will make you today 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 see how to do the trick of the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.740
 eyes with the versatile and current color 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 plum that lends itself very well to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.029
 enhance the type of woman 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.430
 Mediterranean with brown eyes or a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.529
 enhance the color of green eyes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.910
 all this with mine 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 customization combining it to a beautiful one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.090
 warm and bright brown 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.579
 but let's see how you see in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.680
 In this case I have already prepared one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 based on time and then issues 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 let's go straight to the eye makeup of the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 clear that I in fact the light points already 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.579
 previously created and a pencil 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.579
 as announced a plum color 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:01:05.420
 thanks that I'm going to spread out over the whole 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.700
 mobile eyelid depositing greater 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.490
 product towards the attachment of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.890
 eyelashes and as I move away from 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.890
 rarely does the application look down 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.990
 I repeat the operation on both 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.720
 eyes 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.160
 I stretch the eyelid upward like 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.130
 you are seeing to saturate well 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.820
 [Music] 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.740
 each point with a small tongue brush 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.649
 cat 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 I'm going to fade the pencil when saturated 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:58.350
 colored the entire eyelid 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.830
 shading and ended up in other bra 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830
 full 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 [Music] 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.080
 because I am going to segment everything exactly 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.830
 the eyelid 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.830
 mobile 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.200
 also in the shade with the brush 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.310
 getting the eyelid slightly towards 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.709
 up 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.530
 which I won't do when I go to define 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.250
 the angle of the eye will make tania look 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.379
 straight ahead 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.579
 this allows me to give 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:40.180
 the inclination and the cut of the 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:43.239
 nuance fair if I did tirassi trio 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.659
 I pulled the eyelid upwards 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:51.790
 I would go to alter the shape and mine 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.760
 shading if I need to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.389
 add some color I can go to 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.230
 do it safely even in the course 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:05.290
 of the nuance I pull the most part 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.409
 high in the shade up to the eyelid 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:14.950
 fixed jargon means fading 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.639
 or even apply by spreading a 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.060
 something 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:23.290
 the customization I decided to 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.510
 do is not going to fix the pencil 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.930
 plum color with a tone on eye shadow 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:36.350
 tone but with a brown eye shadow 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:40.980
 warm the brown turns me off 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.850
 the red light that is present in colo 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.000
 sponge and these two colors superimposed on 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.980
 I like them a lot 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.100
 in the result they work well 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.620
 the eye shadow in such a way that you go along with it 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:05.640
 the shade I created before with the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 fat product the pencil I go to board 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:14.060
 also the lower eyelid only 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.060
 on the outside of the eye 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.780
 [Music] 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.370
 the us smoke with the same brush a 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.910
 cat tongue I used to fade 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.280
 the pencil of a lower eyelid 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.430
 reminding me that I must never mix 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.220
 brushes used fatty goods 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.190
 with the brushes used for the products in 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.630
 dust as above also the edging 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:45.280
 lower must be fixed with eyeshadow ed 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.030
 I use the magone he used in the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.030
 upper eyelid 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:01.970
 to give more intensity to the look 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.350
 I put a line of infra-mascara mascara 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.590
 at the upper lash line 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.590
 [Music] 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.650
 I'm going to fade with an eye shadow 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.540
 brown in the outer corner 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.540
 [Music] 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.300
 a touch of dust 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.300
 thing 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:34.109
 don't mention the right one 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.109
 [Music] 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.280
 there is also this trick 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.220
 [Music] 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.370
 usable 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.030
 for an evening if we want to leave it 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.250
 more discreet and go out during the day 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.520
 we leave the opaque light as it was in 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.520
 earlier without making this touch 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.020
 so remember light powders for the 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.950
 evening dull light points for the days 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.470
 our mascara is a must 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.470
 [Music] 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.020
 wishing I can approach these 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:20.410
 shade a dark green pencil for 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:27.310
 the inside of the eye a touch of blush 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.310
 that how mascara is needed 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.150
 and finally 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.400
 a pink gloss 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.710
 [Music] 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.480
 at this point we go to see the 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:51.959
 final results 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:51.959
