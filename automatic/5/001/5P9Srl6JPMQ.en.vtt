00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.120 
like the sample size and I wanted the
new<00:03:35.340> color<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.450> didn't<00:03:36.660> care<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.769> now<00:03:37.950> after

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
new color so I didn't care but now after

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.309 
new color so I didn't care but now after
racing<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.790> realized<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.420> maybe<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.780> should<00:03:40.110> be

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
racing I realized that maybe I should be

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.210 
racing I realized that maybe I should be
on<00:03:40.500> top<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.799> my<00:03:40.980> game

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
on top of my game

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.319 
on top of my game
that<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.610> materials<00:03:43.099> now<00:03:44.099> I<00:03:44.129> feel<00:03:44.489> cheap<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
that my materials now I feel cheap and

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.229

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
how I strain all I went skiing one day

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.960 
how I strain all I went skiing one day
so<00:03:48.299> far<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.620> was<00:03:49.769> great<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> hit<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.610> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
