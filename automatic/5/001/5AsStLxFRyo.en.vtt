00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.890
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.440
 tutorial we continue with the escalation is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 possible that in sport climbing or 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.860
 in the one of tim schedules of several lengths 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
 we can find situations 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.020
 where the normal tapes is to say the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 medium or short distances are not 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.590
 enough to avoid certain frictions 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.590
 therefore we will have to use 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.370
 longer tapes in these cases these 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.800
 ribbons should be rings of stitched ribbons 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.469
 in any case 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 but how do we transport these tapes so 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.720
 long so they stay the way they 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.780
 we can not be hooked 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's see it we take the bunch of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.930
 curved trigger and we had it on the other 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.400
 carabiner 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.570
 once passed 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.200
 like we had the two tapes 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 in this way whenever we go to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 monitor 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.110
 and let's take out the curved object whatever 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.930
 be 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.930
 the loop that we always catch when throwing 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.159
 another way in bandolier the carabiners 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.650
 joined the curved in the material holder in 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.190
 this case 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.190
 the rest 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 the bandolier the one with the bandolier 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.340
 we take out with one arm 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340
 we go 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.510
 burg 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.450
 if required 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.060
 we will turn one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.979
 and finally in the messenger bag with the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.380
 Carabiners on shoulder strap we take the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.380
 we take it out 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 It is possible that the streets are very 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.319
 bulky with many frictions and that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.420
 triggers can be opened therefore 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.510
 we use to have insurance 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.130
 in these cases it is a security that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.590
 we should consider at all times 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.320
 one last very important appreciation of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.650
 face your safety with the rings of 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.800
 this tape we have prepared what 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 we had by one of the sides we removed 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.620
 and it stays stretched 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.480
 both are the same as you can see two 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.570
 At the end of a tape one has the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 Fixer of the rubber band and the other one never 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.290
 we must put the fixators in the hoops 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.570
 in the open hoops because so 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.330
 next if I by anybody by 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.640
 any circumstance I returned to 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.250
 carabiner will make one of the ribbons you see 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.740
 that the carabiner goes out instead if 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.370
 I have a tape hoop sorry a fixer 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.659
 a gomita fixed in the open rings 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.970
 bolt to make this this maneuver 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.790
 you can realize that look how it 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.670
 the carabiner would not fall as in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.769
 the case where I was not able to pass the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.190
 rope around the object to make sure and 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.930
 I did not realize that he is in a 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.049
 precarious situation since 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.970
 it's just the rubber to keep that 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.340
 keeps carabiner in position what 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.060
 keeps in our fall therefore 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.100
 this would be a very dangerous situation 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 so remember this can not happen 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.620
 knowing the three ways will give us greater 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.590
 practical resources and automates and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.100
 remember help us make the mountains 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.100
 more secure
