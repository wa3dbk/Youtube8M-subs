use zones on the sole which are intended

use zones on the sole which are intended
to<00:00:35.610> extend<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> life<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> soul<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> so

to extend the life of the soul and so

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
to extend the life of the soul and so
far<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.190> pretty<00:00:38.219> confident<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> will<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.420> just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
far I'm pretty confident it will do just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.889 
far I'm pretty confident it will do just
that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
that
they<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.559> Nikes<00:00:41.010> hexagonal<00:00:41.760> flex<00:00:42.030> grooves

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
they have Nikes hexagonal flex grooves

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
they have Nikes hexagonal flex grooves
that<00:00:42.660> lend<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> shoe<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> great<00:00:43.800> deal<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that lend the shoe a great deal of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.430 
that lend the shoe a great deal of
flexibility<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.870> help<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.289> them

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
flexibility and I think help make them

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
flexibility and I think help make them
even<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:46.770> comfortable<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> foam

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
even more comfortable they have a foam

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
even more comfortable they have a foam
tongue<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> big<00:00:49.590> fan<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.309> two

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
tongue that I'm a big fan of for two

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
tongue that I'm a big fan of for two
reasons<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.449> provides<00:00:51.780> adequate<00:00:52.170> cushioning

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
reasons it provides adequate cushioning

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
reasons it provides adequate cushioning
number<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> still<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.629> ultra-thin

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
number one but it still is ultra-thin

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
number one but it still is ultra-thin
and<00:00:55.590> minimalist<00:00:56.100> number<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and minimalist number two which is a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
and minimalist number two which is a
pretty<00:00:57.149> rare<00:00:57.449> combo<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.379> shoes<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.739> also

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
pretty rare combo the shoes are also

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
pretty rare combo the shoes are also
covered<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.609> much<00:00:59.730> heel<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.300> toe<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.690> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
covered pretty much heel to toe in this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
covered pretty much heel to toe in this
mesh<00:01:01.140> material<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:02.129> allows<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.550> feet<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
mesh material that allows your feet to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
mesh material that allows your feet to
breathe<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.570> provides<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
breathe but also provides a lot of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
breathe but also provides a lot of
structure<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> tell<00:01:06.240> right

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
structure and for what I can tell right

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.880 
structure and for what I can tell right
now<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:07.049> help<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> shoes<00:01:07.650> more

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
now will help make the shoes more

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
now will help make the shoes more
durable<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.490> extend<00:01:09.000> their<00:01:09.150> useful<00:01:09.570> life

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
durable and extend their useful life

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
durable and extend their useful life
also<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.799> fit<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.280> half<00:01:11.490> size<00:01:11.760> small<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
also they fit one half size small as is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
also they fit one half size small as is
common<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.020> most<00:01:13.380> Nikes<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.040> I'd<00:01:14.430> say

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
common with most Nikes and I'd say

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
common with most Nikes and I'd say
they're<00:01:14.820> fairly<00:01:15.299> neutral<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:16.229> maybe<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
they're fairly neutral but maybe a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
they're fairly neutral but maybe a
little<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> narrow<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.580> though<00:01:18.030> I've

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little on the narrow side though I've

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.730 
little on the narrow side though I've
already<00:01:18.570> been<00:01:18.900> able<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> stretch<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
already been able to stretch them out a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.080 
already been able to stretch them out a
little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:20.850> probably

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
little bit and so there are probably

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
little bit and so there are probably
other<00:01:21.420> specs<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.259> note<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.369> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
other specs I could note but I know you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.070 
other specs I could note but I know you
care<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.939> performance<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.600> let's<00:01:24.810> talk

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
care about performance so let's talk

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
care about performance so let's talk
about<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.490> pretty<00:01:26.759> good

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
about that there are pretty good

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
about that there are pretty good

offset<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> basically<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.270> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
offset and basically just get out of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
offset and basically just get out of
your<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.689> during<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> workouts<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:35.130> running

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
your way during the workouts for running

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
your way during the workouts for running
they<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.700> fine<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> wouldn't<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:36.930> them

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they are fine but I wouldn't use them

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
they are fine but I wouldn't use them
for<00:01:37.320> long<00:01:37.530> distances<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.700> weight<00:01:38.909> lifting

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for long distances for weight lifting

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
for long distances for weight lifting
they're<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.600> too<00:01:39.840> especially<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.680> CrossFit

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
they're good too especially for CrossFit

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
style high rep workouts but they just

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260 
style high rep workouts but they just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
definitely some of the best shoes I've

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
definitely some of the best shoes I've
tried<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.060> workout<00:01:51.479> style<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.380> I'm

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
tried out for this workout style but I'm

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530

not<00:01:52.770> without<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.130> few<00:01:53.399> complaints<00:01:53.729> they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
not without a few complaints they

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.539 
not without a few complaints they
probably<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> expensive<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.310> for

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
probably are on the expensive side for

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
probably are on the expensive side for

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shoes but we will no doubt see the price

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340

shoes mold to your foot they also have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
shoes mold to your foot they also have
an<00:02:09.810> odd<00:02:09.989> heel<00:02:10.349> cup<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.679> has

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
an odd heel cup that has

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.910 
an odd heel cup that has
patting<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.270> instead<00:02:12.600> uses<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> design<00:02:13.560> trick

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
patting and instead uses a design trick

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to lock your heel in and that's all

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
to lock your heel in and that's all
great<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.680> think<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> shoes<00:02:17.340> could

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
great but I just think the shoes could

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.340 
great but I just think the shoes could
use<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:18.060> more<00:02:18.270> padding<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.990> didn't

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
use a little more padding here I didn't

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.199 
use a little more padding here I didn't
get<00:02:19.470> blisters<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:20.190> at<00:02:20.310> first<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.640> transition

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
get blisters but at first a transition

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
get blisters but at first a transition
from<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.569> shoes<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.050> quite<00:02:22.290> drastic<00:02:22.830> in

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
from other shoes was quite drastic in

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.860 
from other shoes was quite drastic in
this<00:02:23.160> area<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.580> particular<00:02:23.730> other<00:02:24.420> than<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
this area in particular other than that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.420 
this area in particular other than that
I<00:02:25.050> thought<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> shoes<00:02:25.590> pretty<00:02:25.830> much<00:02:26.040> checked

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I thought the shoes pretty much checked

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.640 
I thought the shoes pretty much checked
every<00:02:26.910> box<00:02:27.120> style<00:02:27.750> functionality<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
every box style functionality and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.590 
every box style functionality and
comfort<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.520> should<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.850> run<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.510> buy

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
comfort but should you run out and buy

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.750 
comfort but should you run out and buy
them<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.530> answer<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.890> maybe<00:02:32.160> my

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
them and the answer is maybe my

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.340 
them and the answer is maybe my
recommendation<00:02:33.450> actually<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> keep

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
recommendation actually is that you keep

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.260 
recommendation actually is that you keep
your<00:02:34.470> eye<00:02:34.530> out<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:34.770> deals<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.090> know

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
your eye out for deals because we know

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.390 
your eye out for deals because we know
the<00:02:36.420> price<00:02:36.630> will<00:02:36.870> drop<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the price will drop I like them for a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979 
the price will drop I like them for a
hundred<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.790> ten<00:02:38.910> dollars<00:02:39.300> but<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.810> them

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
hundred and ten dollars but I like them

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.740 
hundred and ten dollars but I like them
more<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.680> 80<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.250> doubt<00:02:41.970> they'll<00:02:42.209> replace<00:02:42.569> my

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
more for 80 I doubt they'll replace my

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
more for 80 I doubt they'll replace my
nanos<00:02:43.170> or<00:02:43.410> energy<00:02:43.830> boost<00:02:44.100> running<00:02:44.430> shoes<00:02:44.640> but

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
nanos or energy boost running shoes but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.150 
nanos or energy boost running shoes but
I<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.360> see<00:02:45.540> myself<00:02:45.720> regularly<00:02:46.500> using<00:02:47.040> them

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
I could see myself regularly using them

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
I could see myself regularly using them
as<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> gym<00:02:47.700> shoe<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.239> plyometric<00:02:49.020> shoe<00:02:49.290> or<00:02:49.590> a
