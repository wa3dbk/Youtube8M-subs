00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.550
 I welcomed the invitation with great pleasure 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.660
 to present my kitchen this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.190
 evening 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.420
 then after leaving piazza della 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.279
 scale I make this early evening here 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.200
 because I consider it a very place 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 interesting and innovative 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.780
 this place they created because 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.400
 however there is the possibility of finding 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 then the raw materials directly here 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.480
 go down in the market below you choose 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600
 raw materials can be realized 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600
 installations 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.280
 a very interesting situation for 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.400
 who does this job tonight 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.739
 I will present say of my dishes 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.890
 fairly known that I am a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.430
 very fresh raw Sicilian shrimp 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.940
 with a salted lemon cream a ball 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.100
 of ricotta with emulsified nutmeg 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.200
 with a little extra virgin olive oil and then 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.750
 lightened and I created a cold sphere 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.390
 which acts as a union with all the others 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.070
 ingredients and then towards the top of the pa 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.860
 of tomato so I find the taste 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.899
 Mediterranean we know then 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.790
 I make a risotto using the rice in 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.580
 a classic way known with 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.380
 of the Taggiasca olives and what they are 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.570
 precisely the olives of Liguria therefore 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.910
 have these scents a couple given one 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.950
 caper powder and fresh herbs 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.470
 put on that give the feeling of 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.200
 of garden vegetable garden 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.890
 then I make a bottle of lamb 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.120
 coming from Sardinia with a sauce 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.180
 alla cacciatora but very light 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.810
 then a little fresh tomatoes and olives 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.380
 basil peppers with a fried potato 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.760
 which has a non-classical preparation 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.800
 directly fried in oil but comes 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.420
 cooked first in a little butter and water e 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.400
 then later it is cooled and fried 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.820
 therefore it remains very soft inside 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.229
 extremely crunchy or in combination 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.680
 there will also be an avocado cream 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.330
 then by heidi waka modena as sweet 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 I'll make a lemon cake with wild strawberries 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.160
 di bosco is a yoghurt ice cream 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.650
 then at the end I will serve an oil macaron 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.500
 extra virgin olive oil with a small one 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.350
 shock that you drink made of lemon lime 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.350
 mint and Maldon salt 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.319
 this evening we did a 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.319
 pairing wines thinking the dishes a bit 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.519
 at the season we will start with a con 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.769
 appetizer 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.480
 in my opinion one of the most important in 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.930
 Italy as a bubble that they maria 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.599
 elements of ca of the forest 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.090
 with rice we will serve an Alsace wine 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.180
 so a nice wine that goes with it 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.700
 much to the scents of this risotto with 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.400
 lamb a Tuscan wine 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.600
 a red a new farm of palazzone 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.750
 of 2009 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.530
 to conclude a muscat d'asti of 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.530
 on the skin
