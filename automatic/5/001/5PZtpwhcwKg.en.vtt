less money in their pockets which is
always<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.509> problem<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> recession

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
always a problem in the recession

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
always a problem in the recession
there's<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> less<00:01:35.520> costly<00:01:35.700> ribbon<00:01:36.540> microphone

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
there's a less costly ribbon microphone

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
there's a less costly ribbon microphone
called<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> r14<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.490> looking<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.180> the

called the r14 for and looking at the
price<00:01:39.420> point<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.900> seems<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> least

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
price point it seems to be the least

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
price point it seems to be the least
costly<00:01:40.890> ribbon<00:01:41.490> mic<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> market<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> would
