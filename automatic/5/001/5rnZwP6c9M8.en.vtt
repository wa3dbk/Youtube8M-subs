00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.700
 really show you something and that 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.700
 a didgeridoo 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:28.680
 that looks like a suitcase and that is 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:32.110
 just a box of wood 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.710
 you yourself relatively quickly 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.150
 can assemble and that's easy 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.150
 only afford from the hardware store 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.930
 that is so spruce the instructions it 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.869
 then on my side that would be now too 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.379
 the whole thing takes a long time and so on 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:55.470
 continue to enumerate and here you can 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.960
 to take a look 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.280
 So the whole thing is shaped inside 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.689
 designed as one 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.850
 tidy pipe is practically in it 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.880
 and now to see the mouthpiece 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.970
 that it is made of beech I have with one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.009
 or router works for it here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.740
 including the tube fits on it and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.579
 which here in other diameters 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.929
 I lived as I therefore had two 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.679
 different diameters because so pure 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.569
 mill 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.969
 but it was relatively easy and I am 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.679
 So no table so it was 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.649
 actually for everyone 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.579
 an upper freese costs 30 euros or so 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.920
 is not expensive 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.090
 if you do not have one already and that is 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 a major it is 14 o'clock 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.179
 And this is a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.179
 extension like this 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.859
 I can pull that out of here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.690
 there you can see that here are so notched 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.970
 inside the hook the 1 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.180
 and by the fact that I have one now 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.280
 have different length of air column 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.280
 I have just different low tones 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.670
 So I have now so well 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:43.180
 measuring instrument that indicates the pitch 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.530
 So now I seem to be talking and ing 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.319
 so that's the shortest now 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.470
 air column so the highest sound with 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:56.859
 didgeridoo see what this case 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.859
 shown there 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.430
 So a d is a classic 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.150
 Didgeridoo the deepest when I completely 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.150
 out target 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 e 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.850
 I do not even play that bad 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.990
 have it now on the highest tone 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.990
 set to rise 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.730
 the overtones we are fine now 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.120
 So the voice effects are you 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.120
 also very nice 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.630
 These double strokes are also very much 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 Nice that I need only a pulse 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.950
 give that comes sometimes two and two 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.950
 to be like this 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.110
 practically with the same use twice 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.110
 to fastest 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.910
 moist-happy 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:23.400
 so for a little money you can get there 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:28.289
 So fast that itself tinker what have 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.490
 I paid a total of 30 euros at risk 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.039
 handle and the pipe 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.620
 That's why I think eight euros cost 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.110
 And you do not need that either 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.039
 necessarily because the tower can not 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.590
 so big, that's enough 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.110
 you sit directly on the plot 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.770
 stop it without it will still be 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:54.979
 more compact and the instruction is then does 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.979
 If the types of the website
