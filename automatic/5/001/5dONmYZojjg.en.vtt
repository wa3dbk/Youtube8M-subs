which<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.260> our<00:00:22.410> first<00:00:22.650> film<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.699> used<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
which was our first film we used a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
which was our first film we used a
Barbie<00:00:24.779> Dreamhouse<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:26.189> borrowed<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
Barbie Dreamhouse that was borrowed and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
Barbie Dreamhouse that was borrowed and
we<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.269> back<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> wanted

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
we had to give it back so then we wanted

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
we had to give it back so then we wanted
to<00:00:28.590> make<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:29.640> films<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.750> decided<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to make more films we decided to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
to make more films we decided to
construct<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> set<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> cardboard<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.090> just

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
construct a set out of cardboard we just

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
construct a set out of cardboard we just
use<00:00:33.329> recycled<00:00:33.840> cardboard<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.070> Korea

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
use recycled cardboard that was Korea

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
use recycled cardboard that was Korea
girl<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> film<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.559> terrible

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
girl the film that was a really terrible

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860 
girl the film that was a really terrible
idea<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.640> set<00:00:38.820> didn't<00:00:39.120> stand<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
idea because the set didn't stand up and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.209 
idea because the set didn't stand up and
it<00:00:39.960> didn't<00:00:40.200> support<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> weight<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.980> anything

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it didn't support the weight of anything

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
it didn't support the weight of anything
and<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> throw<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.649> after<00:00:44.010> we

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and we had to throw it out after we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
and we had to throw it out after we
finished<00:00:44.370> filming<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.510> decided<00:00:45.780> we

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
finished filming so when we decided we

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
finished filming so when we decided we
wanted<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> make<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> lot<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.800> films<00:00:47.280> we

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
wanted to make a lot more films we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
wanted to make a lot more films we
needed<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:49.370> set<00:00:50.370> ID<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.780> reusable<00:00:52.739> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
needed a set ID that was reusable so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
needed a set ID that was reusable so
that<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.489> build<00:00:53.879> many<00:00:54.539> different<00:00:55.079> sets

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that we could build many different sets

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.279 
that we could build many different sets
using<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> backing

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
using just the one kind of backing

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
using just the one kind of backing
because<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.129> didn't<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:01:00.000> taking<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
because we didn't want to be taking up a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.869 
because we didn't want to be taking up a
whole<00:01:00.930> bunch<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> storage<00:01:01.649> space<00:01:01.949> because

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
whole bunch of storage space because

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
whole bunch of storage space because
when<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.140> making<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.680> lot

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
when you were going to be making a lot

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.890 
when you were going to be making a lot
of<00:01:05.339> rooms<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.729> Barbie's<00:01:06.000> Dreamhouse<00:01:06.299> because

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of rooms in Barbie's Dreamhouse because

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
of rooms in Barbie's Dreamhouse because
she's<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.320> massive<00:01:07.619> house<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
she's got massive house so this is the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
she's got massive house so this is the
idea<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.330> came<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.110> decided<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
idea we came up with we decided to get a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
idea we came up with we decided to get a
really<00:01:12.960> big<00:01:13.619> plank<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> wood<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
really big plank of wood it's just a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
really big plank of wood it's just a
really<00:01:15.210> thin<00:01:15.299> piece<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.840> wood<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
really thin piece of wood from a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
really thin piece of wood from a
hardware<00:01:17.340> store<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.330> divided<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.869> into

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
hardware store and we divided it into

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.910 
hardware store and we divided it into
three<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:20.460> sections<00:01:21.470> I'll<00:01:22.470> show<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
three even sections I'll show you the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
three even sections I'll show you the
scale<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> metric<00:01:24.659> system

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
scale with if you know the metric system

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.249 
scale with if you know the metric system
it's<00:01:25.500> 40<00:01:25.860> centimeters<00:01:26.430> across<00:01:26.549> yep<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's 40 centimeters across yep and I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
it's 40 centimeters across yep and I
don't<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> inches<00:01:29.520> neither<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
don't know that in inches neither do I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.499 
don't know that in inches neither do I
so<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.619> divided<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.430> three<00:01:32.670> even<00:01:32.790> pieces<00:01:32.909> we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so we divided into three even pieces we

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.670 
so we divided into three even pieces we
cut<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> door<00:01:34.409> frame<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.070> each<00:01:35.509> panel<00:01:36.680> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
cut out a door frame on each panel so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
cut out a door frame on each panel so
that<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.070> door<00:01:38.340> options<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.270> here

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that we have door options like over here

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
that we have door options like over here
where<00:01:39.570> we've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.720> Barbie's<00:01:40.290> front<00:01:40.470> doors<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
where we've got Barbie's front doors or

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
where we've got Barbie's front doors or
we<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.579> window<00:01:41.880> options<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.720> in

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
we have window options as well like in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
we have window options as well like in
the<00:01:42.960> kitchen<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.500> windows<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.100> um<00:01:44.960> no<00:01:45.960> no
