00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.359
 In short, what is anesthesia anesthesia first 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.269
 all this is a dream here too 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.420
 human difference man may not be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.160
 more and he can not sleep at the same time it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.760
 so -called local anesthesia but it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.500
 no anesthesia is the surgeon introduces into the area 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.619
 operations local cinema plants all 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.840
 known him to and we fly at it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 the person who is undergoing surgery is not sleeping 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.530
 but he sees everything and hears everything on him 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 it hurts quite the case when they say 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.750
 that the operation is under anesthesia 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.719
 anesthesia means that the first person 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.780
 naturally and it is possible in itself 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.370
 taken for granted and the second to man 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 it is completely asleep at this time does not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.870
 present recruit accordingly 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.309
 such an effect can be achieved 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 anesthesiology is achieved by 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.320
 introducing certain apparatus first 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.890
 turn it is to perish subject this group 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 drugs 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 they are so called and carpenters thanks 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.200
 which person is with him 2 groups 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240
 drugs and analgesics is a drug 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 thanks to which we will not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.399
 operation because any surgical 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.649
 the operation is of course very 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.909
 traumatic because no one can 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.189
 suggest that a person can transfer 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 operation without anesthesia and so 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.060
 man sleeps during anesthesia to man 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 absolutely not painful there are additional 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 groups of drugs that pray time 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 places flaws in the first place so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 called muscle relaxant this drugs 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.979
 which provide complete relaxation 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 skeletal muscle to 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 muscle contraction so that the muscles themselves in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 surgery time surgeons did not interfere with this three 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.830
 the main groups of drugs that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.690
 used for almost any 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.759
 drug and additionally at 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 need if necessary then are found 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.310
 during anesthesia or transpose 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.890
 antibiotics 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 In addition, there are medications affecting 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.729
 blood coagulability did not go away full-time 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.720
 bleeding time we have is being held 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.640
 announced 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.290
 this is which this effect is somewhat 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.780
 eliminates can be found natural 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
 fusion and and medium intravenously so time 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.470
 any operation occur some 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.370
 losses 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.190
 minor blood loss and then all 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 still you have to somehow compensate 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.380
 thus praying large enough 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.980
 number of drugs to ensure 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.159
 adequate 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.090
 anesthesia during surgery and these 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.049
 drugs in fact they are very 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 great progress occurred in 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.489
 use of these drugs in themselves 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.260
 drugs too because very 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.120
 a short time ago there were drugs 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.519
 visions that accompanied her 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 significant side effects like 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.879
 heavy and not so heavy in 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.200
 postoperatively everyone remembers 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:49.290
 preparations calypsol for example or ketamine 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.940
 after which were very pronounced 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.970
 hallucination well what if they gave 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.980
 good it could cry they were 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.030
 Could be terrible some 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.379
 hallucinations in addition 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.549
 postoperative nausea that's what 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.890
 pursued accompanied by any anesthesia 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.079
 very short time supervision now 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.410
 thanks because a little bit all 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.790
 changed for the better pharmacology 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.609
 provided such drugs that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 very quickly excreted 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.480
 anesthesiology more and more 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.590
 approaching to be 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.870
 ambulatory drugs very quickly 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.930
 excretion period 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.880
 they are very small and they render 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.110
 minimal impact due to the fact that they 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.200
 quickly removed from the body 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.580
 systems of the human body in everyday life 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.900
 what we see when a person 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.830
 wakes up on the operating table he 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.840
 wakes up and says 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.480
 before the operation has already ended can not 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.300
 be and really it is so it is not a myth 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.740
 and no exaggeration when giving patient 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.260
 that your operation is over 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.730
 you see on the evolution of wonder is of course 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.000
 always happy this is the highest score 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.130
 the story of the log and always happy with it 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.350
 fact but this is primarily due to 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.830
 Such a range of medical preparations 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.830
 which we have
