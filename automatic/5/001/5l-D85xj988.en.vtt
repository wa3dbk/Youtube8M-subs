00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello here thierry farmers 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.979
 today I will introduce you 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.979
 manure spreading 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 so here behind me you can see 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 loading a manure spreader 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 so what is the manure it is a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 mixture of animal excrement so the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 excrement of animals that are mixed 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.480
 usually with straw this is the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 case often for cattle and horses 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 once the cleaning is done boxes of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.449
 stables we bring it to the end of the field and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 there we are taking it back for 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.440
 go hang them so why the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.910
 put in the fields right already it's a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 way to get rid of it if we had to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.610
 put it in a dump that would 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 pure loss 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.769
 and in addition to an unimaginable cost and in 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.170
 plus this manure can enrich the 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.120
 soils here me for example we manure after 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 analysis I can calculate that I have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.940
 about five to six units of nitrogen per 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 ton it's the same in phosphorus and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 potash but in addition to that there is also 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 a lot of organic matter which 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 helps to lighten my balance enrich it and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 so give it more value 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.869
 spreading is done with the help of a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 spreader is the device that you 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.460
 can see behind me that being able 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.400
 work here so it's made up of a 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 carpet of a crate and also of a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 hedgehog 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 there are modern spreaders who 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 are at vertical hedgehogs so the carpet 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 allows to drive manure to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.230
 the back while the hedgehog 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.650
 turn and steer the manure 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.180
 level of singing 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:44.060
 where manure wall that is well scattered 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:45.680
 in the field it's off the ground 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 see that it's well exploded right there it's 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.700
 sure about the green manure so the fertilizer 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.230
 green will take advantage of the manure the manure is going 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 enjoy a little green cover 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:02.060
 green manure to avoid clearing 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.580
 too much smell and we will have a floor that will be 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.410
 better because with more 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.530
 of amendments and more material 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.530
 organic 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.880
 I wanted to take the opportunity to make you 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 part of a little anecdote that comes from 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.209
 happen to be no more than half an hour 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.420
 so we were going out so 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.280
 with a trailer and manure on the road 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 so of course there have been solutions 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.209
 because in singing the trailer 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 goes into the manure so is the catch 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.770
 roux is so in general we try to 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.540
 put on the side to speed up a good 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.280
 blow to say to clean the wheels and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.709
 Then I go with the telescopic 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.150
 in order to clean all that so I have 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.080
 not had time to spend to clean 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.630
 so much is it clearly that came 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.430
 just to go out and a lady went 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.440
 stopped she began to express to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 to express oneself because open by saying yeah 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.690
 it's unacceptable it's disgusting 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.560
 it's disgusting you realize 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.260
 so I still had trouble 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.269
 understand that a person can not 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 admit that we can dirty good knowing 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.560
 that I was going to clean after certainly this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.850
 was not done yet but we have 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.880
 less and less tolerance compared 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.230
 to these problems there then certainly we 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.360
 have to be careful we farmers 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.100
 to avoid serving the roads is 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.150
 however went clean when we can 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.980
 so there 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.569
 on the fact right after I passed 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.750
 with the telescopic to clean 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.709
 certainly there are traces on the ground but 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.959
 it's no longer dangerous for the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.519
 traffic 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.950
 so the means have been put for the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.110
 do I think it's an effort that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.260
 must be done by everyone and it must 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.689
 everyone can torment the other ourselves 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.280
 we have to clean and that's what 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.730
 we try to do more and more 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.099
 I think 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.530
 but individuals must also 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.970
 understand that the activity can have 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.439
 nuisance is sure that we and pan of 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.060
 manure is because we have more 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.680
 nice it's true that the smell is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.510
 not nice but at the same time it makes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.069
 part of life 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.389
 everyone goes to the toilet and well it takes 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.209
 know that the droppings must be 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.500
 have to be processed be used so 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.879
 that's just what I 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.480
 wanted to tell you by telling you about 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.480
 this little anecdote 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.100
 so having talked a bit about 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.450
 nuisances that we could cause 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.060
 to talk to you a little about salt 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.670
 can also suffer when we when we 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.350
 works on periurban areas you 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.270
 can see a little here the remains that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.250
 were picked up in the plot then 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.450
 we wonder what people do 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.230
 even waste dumps that are 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.840
 disposition 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.750
 not very far from us so between 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.580
 the remains of canes is eventually 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.580
 broken glasses pieces of polystyrene 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.950
 plastic bags and then suddenly we 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.390
 found in a tin can a 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.640
 piece of plastic or a piece of 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.230
 glass and then we we what is it 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.210
 causes us problems 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.800
 very important in terms of 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.910
 of loss because the truck can be 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.259
 refused but to the dump and without 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.870
 mention the risks that may beings 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.360
 that can happen of course to 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.460
 consumers when he has 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.650
 something like that in his in his 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.830
 tin can or in his basket of 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.830
 vegetables 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.090
 so here it is a heat 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.410
 extraordinary I am at the foot of the volcano 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.530
 is there you can see there is lava 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.759
 which is flowing at my feet 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.270
 no, we're going to go I'm kidding it's 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:22.340
 just sludge that's it 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.350
 part of the video anyway 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.210
 so these are just sludge 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.320
 and so these products will come 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.850
 good both to clutter the station 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.729
 treatment plant or 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.949
 the m 2 where anaerobic digestion and then come 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.440
 enrich the soil so it's a winner 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.740
 winner for everyone and it allows 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.360
 to also reprocess residues with a 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.520
 monitoring of course quite important 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.620
 heavy metal analyzes of things 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.490
 like that good it's all about 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.810
 products of vegetable origin of remains of 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.430
 potato fries 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.870
 maybe a little bit of oil I do not know 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.300
 but all products are good 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.919
 of vegetable origin so there is no ya not 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.540
 of danger is so these are sub 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.500
 products that are also used at 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.590
 we to accompany them finally for 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.380
 to enrich the soil and come from 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.900
 to clutter the plain I was going to say that 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.090
 a role also of a useful role to this 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.410
 level man and here we come 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.090
 so at the end of this video 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.699
 I hope you learned a little 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.950
 more about today's farmer I 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.419
 invite you to put your comments 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.210
 possibly your remarks 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.280

 youtube the twitter account or even 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.060
 come do not see me on farmers 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.520
