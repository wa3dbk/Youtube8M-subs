00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
a challenge throughout the day I would

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.310 
a challenge throughout the day I would
have<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.790> find<00:02:28.060> out<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> scale<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.780> 1<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.290> 10

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
have to find out on a scale of 1 to 10

how<00:02:29.650> much<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.489> wife<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.970> enjoying<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:32.050> you

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
looking forward to this if I could get

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
looking forward to this if I could get
it<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.959> say<00:02:35.110> eight<00:02:35.350> or<00:02:35.620> more<00:02:35.650> I'd<00:02:36.519> win<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it to say eight or more I'd win the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.960 
it to say eight or more I'd win the
challenge<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.530> aileron<00:02:39.010> which

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
challenge so this is the aileron which

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.229 
challenge so this is the aileron which
actually<00:02:40.150> changes<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.110> way<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.470> roll

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
actually changes the way that we roll

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.690 
actually changes the way that we roll
when<00:02:43.239> we're<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.600> flight<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.550> come

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
when we're in in flight and if you come

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.660 
when we're in in flight and if you come
and<00:02:45.820> have<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> look<00:02:45.970> round<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:48.519> we've

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and have a look round here there we've

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.870 
and have a look round here there we've
got<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:49.480> big<00:02:49.660> shock<00:02:49.959> absorbers<00:02:50.440> and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
got really big shock absorbers and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.810 
got really big shock absorbers and
I<00:02:52.410> don't<00:02:53.410> think<00:02:53.440> talking<00:02:53.800> technical<00:02:54.550> work

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
I don't think talking technical work

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.970 
I don't think talking technical work
it's<00:02:55.150> all<00:02:55.330> okay<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:56.230> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.470> pull<00:02:56.830> us

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it's all okay it's going to pull us

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.590 
it's all okay it's going to pull us
through<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> air<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.560> it's<00:03:00.210> then<00:03:01.210> we've<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
through the air so it's then we've got a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.570 
through the air so it's then we've got a
fantastic<00:03:01.780> engine<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.650> here<00:03:02.800> as<00:03:02.890> well<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.340> don't

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
fantastic engine in here as well I don't

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.690 
fantastic engine in here as well I don't
want<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.090> right<00:03:04.870> when<00:03:05.050> we<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.700> just

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
want to see it right when we get in just

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.100 
want to see it right when we get in just
make<00:03:06.850> sure<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.030> hold<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.660> handheld

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.960 
make sure you hold on to that handheld
okay<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.740> then<00:03:08.980> pull<00:03:09.160> yourself<00:03:09.520> up<00:03:09.670> there<00:03:09.820> was

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
okay and then pull yourself up there was

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.480 
okay and then pull yourself up there was
some<00:03:10.270> logic<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.720> picking<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.200> pa-28<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.220> seems

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
some logic to picking a pa-28 it seems

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.980 
some logic to picking a pa-28 it seems
that<00:03:12.580> people<00:03:12.730> think<00:03:13.060> aircraft<00:03:13.570> with<00:03:13.720> lower

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
that people think aircraft with lower

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.890 
that people think aircraft with lower
wings<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.530> more<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.130> real<00:03:15.460> planes<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.750> they

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
wings a more like real planes so they

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.840 
wings a more like real planes so they
feel<00:03:17.050> safer<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:17.920> even<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.280> didn't<00:03:18.610> seem<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
feel safer but even that didn't seem to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.180 
feel safer but even that didn't seem to
be<00:03:18.970> working<00:03:19.120> here<00:03:19.600> how<00:03:20.500> much<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.800> enjoying

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
be working here how much you enjoying

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.000 
be working here how much you enjoying
this<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> scale<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:21.940> 1<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.420> 10<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.900> have<00:03:23.860> to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
this on a scale of 1 to 10 I have to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.540 
this on a scale of 1 to 10 I have to
answer<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.310> yet<00:03:25.590> I'm<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.800> quite<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.190> yet

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.920 

it<00:03:30.550> seemed<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.880> make<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.060> lot<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.300> sense<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.720> take

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it seemed to make a lot of sense to take

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.290 
it seemed to make a lot of sense to take
some<00:03:32.140> travel<00:03:32.560> tablets<00:03:33.010> one<00:03:33.610> person<00:03:34.000> advised

some travel tablets one person advised

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.120 
some travel tablets one person advised
me<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.630> at<00:03:34.900> worst<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.470> would<00:03:35.590> ease<00:03:35.710> any<00:03:35.950> air

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
me that at worst it would ease any air

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.980 
me that at worst it would ease any air
sickness<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.820> best<00:03:37.480> would<00:03:37.720> make<00:03:37.870> my

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
sickness and the best would make my

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.170 
sickness and the best would make my
passenger<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.710> drowsy<00:03:39.040> they'd<00:03:39.610> stop<00:03:40.000> their

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
passenger so drowsy they'd stop their

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:51.600 
passenger so drowsy they'd stop their
whinging<00:03:40.600> when<00:03:40.750> they<00:03:40.870> fell<00:03:41.020> asleep
