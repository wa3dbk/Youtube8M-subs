00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.740
 Good morning my name is the gestapo 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.119
 I am a project manager at the company 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.160
 grimme for the self-driving 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.300
 Potato harvesting technology and we are here 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.739
 on potato europe 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 So it's been the last few days 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.850
 properly rained we want today 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.780
 drive a show yesterday 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.790
 everything set 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.820
 and I would like to just that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.699
 baritone 470 four rich potato harvest 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.190
 machine with a roll separate in it 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.370
 and 1 7 tons of bunker begins shortly the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.500
 machine through from front to back 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.500
 tell something about it so let's do it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.070
 start at the beginning of the plaintiff 14 rich 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.049
 plaintiff who is so structured that one 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.549
 the wave has with 1 up for band and that 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.960
 herb from side to side so i 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.420
 do not process that into the machine 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.369
 must and I have two grind on 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.869
 each side one where i get the deep ones 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.540
 participate in leadership so that fits 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.549
 constantly accurate to the height of the time 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.070
 that is completely independent on two 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.750
 I can go over the front axle 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.610
 I have the left and right adjustment 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 autopilots I do not know about the lakes 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.090
 can that behind it in any case that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 of course, the driver's too 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 relieve 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 when driving so he always on the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.530
 red organs can concentrate like that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.189
 that he always optimal attitude 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.770
 can drive 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.999
 the large steering angle is typical for 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.499
 So this machine is the one 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.619
 relatively for such a big one 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:41.179
 machine very manoeuvrable what you too 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.689
 again looks with the rear axle 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.069
 you can also rotate 19 degrees so that 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.070
 I give him a very big small turning circle 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.450
 have 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.060
 to write from the front axle 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.950
 recording so we have the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.510
 loop into the deep leadership of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.490
 that means I have red organs 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.500
 no more pressure in the steam 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 what condenses what again means that me 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.159
 in wet conditions like we do now 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.050
 today have no education in the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.030
 dam havers or nothing is running on the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.260
 dam that soon on the band so beautiful 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.420
 apart are clearly driven 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.160
 what the better promotion outside wall 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.610
 accomplished and no blockages 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.709
 Here forward to follow so we did have 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.410
 three knocker in the whole machine a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.700
 rotor knocker thus four roll then 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.980
 we have a panning knocker 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.959
 it almost makes the product swing 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.060
 or break the product up and down 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.070
 third band we have one again 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 red button the same principle as we did 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.750
 move here so we have one 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.150
 recording tape a first signal and a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.030
 second band before we on the train 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.560
 come on good as we otherwise still 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.870
 a shaker in that it for all 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.200
 extreme conditions around the product still 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.030
 to break apart again 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.290
 we need that in these conditions 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.480
 not really so we have already 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 extreme but not so extreme that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.519
 we need the device so what now 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.739
 Extremely striking is this machine 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.299
 the one through the sieve channel has 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.829
 that means we did not find any medium 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.750
 a metal band always ensures 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.640
 constipation and I have less of them 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.260
 surface and this is from the front up 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.239
 behind this machine completely 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.400
 all the time so I have a camera 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.170
 pro for the whole channel i see 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.209
 do not need a better two cameras 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.950
 Survey less expectations in the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.390
 So no center in the middle 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.579
 all continuous waves 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 what a simpler again 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.329
 Maintenance then we come from 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.519
 first victory with the vibrating beater at 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.950
 the palatinate we have in this machine 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.450
 A roller against you can see how she can 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.980
 I drive the structurally up and down 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.950
 so I always have the best 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.079
 attitude at many machines is 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.760
 I have to work very hard in the middle 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.769
 from the channel I have to screw the two 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.870
 then I turn this down and up 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.000
 and the experiences we have is 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.410
 if you have a lot of effort 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.850
 you do that less so they stand 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.459
 always round and is the cloud separation 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.200
 not optimal because it can do that 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.150
 I 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.280
 Just look from the cabin like 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.140
 she stands tall and walks like me 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.480
 she wants to have within three 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.190
 in seconds this is a button andré wheel 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.620
 At the terminal that is actually very 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.300
 just here you can see the roll 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.709
 So separator from the position as 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.109
 that's probably pretty little 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.030
 a true roll separator that is 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.530
 i can do the distances i can 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.239
 pushing apart can not get bigger 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.889
 or make smaller with what the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.440
 Normally, aggression can be regulated 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.970
 in conventional systems you have the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.950
 you have to swap roles so I have to 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.330
 you remove and reinstall and at 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.560
 These systems do not even that of the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.510
 Cabin off again with over one 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.880
 drive apart so that apart 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.090
 I am aggressive during the ride 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.800
 the train device can stop 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.050
 He was then each a degree elevator 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.419
 are so that the hedgehog band stand with 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.729
 relegated on top of which the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.620
 potatoes in the relays châteaux com the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.260
 rings laptop the becks that's one 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.120
 bag that's what we call that and this one has 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.830
 holes so that I first less 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.530
 Adhesive surface so have the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.080
 potatoes do not stick in there to 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.090
 stuck in it and I have extra 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.620
 additional deportation was very important 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.919
 is at this point that I again 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.750
 the loose earth gets away so we are 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.729
 arrived in the bunker so the bunker 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.770
 command band comes here the 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.350
 optimizing the refilling optimization over 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.789
 Of course, ultrasonic sensors are not 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.820
 more the difference from the day and 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.410
 night so photosensitivity and then 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.389
 actually the essential point in 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.340
 one in the bunker we have at one 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.139
 through bunker floor but that 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.660
 problem with me from the top during the 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.550
 Ride always stays here in stripes 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.070
 potato 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.330
 as well that I do not have the whole bunker 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.440
 can do full 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.480
 something we have to be careful 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.930
 Now you can run the booker backwards 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.910
 to let 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.220
 For this we have the chain a left 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.110
 side of the machine we have high running 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.960
 Leave the strip of potatoes 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.940
 almost as high as she thinks she always is 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.560
 the gentle we know or that is 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.900
 gently the potato the light here 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.660
 always and the rolls here quite loose 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.190
 Rolled around here so the engine in 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.600
 490 hp mercedes benz at 465 and that 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.300
 It's always nice about this engine 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.150
 in normal operation with 1250 turns 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.770
 so it runs very sparingly and he saves 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.570
 takes only the speed high was the 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.220
 really needs that too 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.720
 Everything is monitored electronically and goes 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.290
 Fully automatic the driver needs it 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.770
 do nothing 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.690
 we have two here in the machine 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.330
 one of them is for driving 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.940
 one of them is for the red technique and 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.370
 then we have two video monitors where we are 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.140
 each eight cameras can show where 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.490
 a visual protect in it is the macbook 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.990
 every day ensures that you are somewhere 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.960
 error is or i have a machine 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.240
 function operator automatically the 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.620
 monitor to the right camera blows up and 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.070
 Do not adjust them like me 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.070
 himself wants 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.160
 the technical equipment of this 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.290
 specific machine of the name was itron 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.970
 says yes already have the machine in very 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.750
 many different equipment me 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.000
 call a few 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.760
 we have a crawler machine where you 2 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.130
 rappen instead of the rear wheels we get 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.070
 have different devices multis 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.620
 double multis double enemies father so 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:24.190
 very versatile more information 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.570
 Find them on www.twitter.com 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.030
 all information about the machine 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.300
 including videos and so on 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.300
 can
