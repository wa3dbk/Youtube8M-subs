created quite a lot of them at the
beginning<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:06.590> always<00:01:06.799> made<00:01:06.979> sure

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
beginning and they always made sure

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.279 
beginning and they always made sure
there<00:01:07.340> was<00:01:07.369> less<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.760> look<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.210> think<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
it one way you call a three bets on the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.270 
it one way you call a three bets on the
button<00:01:19.969> will<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.420> i<00:01:20.509> was<00:01:20.659> looking<00:01:20.929> to<00:01:20.960> get

people's<00:01:22.280> hand<00:01:22.490> ranges<00:01:22.909> with<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.210> which<00:01:23.539> is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
people's hand ranges with that which is

elaborate with tons and tons of
information<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.210> there<00:01:29.359> but<00:01:29.840> i<00:01:29.899> did<00:01:30.079> that<00:01:30.289> on

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
information on there but i did that on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.020 
information on there but i did that on
purpose<00:01:30.499> so<00:01:31.219> that<00:01:31.249> he<00:01:31.520> could<00:01:31.700> get<00:01:31.939> an

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
purpose so that he could get an

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.399 
purpose so that he could get an
understanding<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:33.670> lot<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.729> these

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
understanding of how a lot of these

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.239 
understanding of how a lot of these
variables<00:01:36.409> work<00:01:37.840> but<00:01:38.840> even<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:39.229> once<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.740> made

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
variables work but even so once I made

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.020 
variables work but even so once I made
all<00:01:40.399> these<00:01:40.609> badges<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.479> fly<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:43.030> realized

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
all these badges to fly that I realized

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.520 
all these badges to fly that I realized
it<00:01:44.149> was<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.420> too<00:01:44.569> much<00:01:44.600> information<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.350> i

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
it was just too much information that i

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.469 
it was just too much information that i
was<00:01:45.979> actually<00:01:46.130> game<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.640> not<00:01:47.270> enough

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
was actually game and not enough

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.050 
was actually game and not enough
information<00:01:47.749> that<00:01:48.319> was<00:01:48.469> kind<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.369> relevant<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
information that was kind of relevant a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090 
information that was kind of relevant a
lot<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.630> times<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.319> i<00:01:51.350> was<00:01:51.530> everything<00:01:51.859> i<00:01:51.920> go

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
lot of times so i was everything i go

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.469 
lot of times so i was everything i go
scan<00:01:52.399> these<00:01:52.520> badges<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.060> time<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.389> try

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
scan these badges all the time to try

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.539 
scan these badges all the time to try
and<00:01:53.600> find<00:01:53.749> something<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.549> relevance

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
and find something that was a relevance

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.419 
and find something that was a relevance
i'll<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.270> was<00:01:56.359> not<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.659> wasn't<00:01:56.929> good<00:01:57.049> so

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
i'll just it was not it wasn't good so

i'll just it was not it wasn't good so
and<00:01:58.429> then<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> knew<00:01:59.509> there<00:01:59.689> was<00:01:59.810> some<00:02:00.049> kind<00:02:00.289> of

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and then I I knew there was some kind of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.929 
and then I I knew there was some kind of
way<00:02:00.499> where<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.829> could<00:02:00.979> get<00:02:01.310> these<00:02:01.490> badges<00:02:01.670> to

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
way where you could get these badges to

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.289 
way where you could get these badges to
show<00:02:02.119> up<00:02:02.679> when<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:03.979> relevant<00:02:04.490> ie<00:02:04.850> when<00:02:05.270> a

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
show up when the I relevant ie when a

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.680 
show up when the I relevant ie when a
player<00:02:07.929> goes<00:02:08.929> out<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.350> like<00:02:09.560> an<00:02:10.480> optimal<00:02:11.480> tight

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
player goes out of like an optimal tight

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.410 
player goes out of like an optimal tight
range<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.190> get<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.700> color

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
range then you can get a color

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.500 
range then you can get a color
definition<00:02:15.080> not<00:02:15.200> no<00:02:15.470> definition<00:02:16.130> or

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
definition not no definition or

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.140 
definition not no definition or
these<00:02:16.689> colored<00:02:17.049> shoes<00:02:20.849> these<00:02:21.849> are<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.030> bit

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
these colored shoes these are a bit

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.190 
these colored shoes these are a bit
different<00:02:22.180> I'm<00:02:22.659> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.870> show<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.049> how<00:02:23.110> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
different I'm going to show you how to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.449 
different I'm going to show you how to
make<00:02:23.319> these<00:02:23.409> call<00:02:23.620> definitions<00:02:24.099> now<00:02:24.250> because

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
make these call definitions now because

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.710 
make these call definitions now because
they're<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.610> bit<00:02:24.819> bit<00:02:25.000> they're<00:02:25.180> different<00:02:25.629> in

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
they're a bit bit they're different in

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.059 
they're a bit bit they're different in
our<00:02:25.870> definitions<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.650> they're<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.799> lot<00:02:27.010> more

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
our definitions and they're a lot more

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.569 
our definitions and they're a lot more
useful<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:29.200> i<00:02:29.230> said<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:30.159> i<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.400> just

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
useful like i said like i was just

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.880 
useful like i said like i was just
saying<00:02:30.790> when<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> player<00:02:32.019> goes<00:02:32.290> out<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.680> an

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
saying when a player goes out of an

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.380 
saying when a player goes out of an
optimal<00:02:33.310> range<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.849> can<00:02:33.909> get<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> color

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
optimal range you can get a color

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.420 
optimal range you can get a color
definition<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.049> flag<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.799> then<00:02:36.010> this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
definition to flag this and then this

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.220 
definition to flag this and then this
core<00:02:36.670> definition<00:02:36.879> will<00:02:37.329> only<00:02:37.569> appear<00:02:38.140> when

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
core definition will only appear when

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.330 
core definition will only appear when
somebody's<00:02:41.230> getting<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.829> line<00:02:42.069> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
somebody's getting out of line and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.559 
somebody's getting out of line and
that's<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.730> only<00:02:42.879> time<00:02:43.030> when<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.269> really

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
that's the only time when you really

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.500 
that's the only time when you really
need<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.290> information<00:02:44.590> anywhere<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:46.060> before

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
need this information anywhere so before

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.690 
need this information anywhere so before
I<00:02:46.540> made<00:02:46.840> these<00:02:46.959> no<00:02:47.319> definitions<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.310> made<00:02:48.670> a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
I made these no definitions and I made a

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.000 
I made these no definitions and I made a
ton<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:48.970> batches<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.629> there<00:02:49.870> another<00:02:50.829> thing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
ton of batches and there another thing

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.800 
ton of batches and there another thing
that<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.280> realizes<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:52.090> when<00:02:52.329> you<00:02:52.450> make<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.629> no

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
that it realizes that when you make a no

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.360 
that it realizes that when you make a no
definition<00:02:53.290> make<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> budget<00:02:53.709> out<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.129> here

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
definition make a budget out of it here

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.190 
definition make a budget out of it here
I'm<00:02:54.730> running<00:02:55.030> through<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.239> database<00:02:55.720> take

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
I'm running through the database take

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020 
I'm running through the database take
some<00:02:56.379> toulon<00:02:56.829> took<00:02:57.040> an<00:02:57.340> absolute<00:02:57.549> ton<00:02:57.909> of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
some toulon took an absolute ton of

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.750 
some toulon took an absolute ton of
space<00:02:58.389> and<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.290> did<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> base<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> best

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
space and you did a base so the best

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.460 
space and you did a base so the best
thing<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.299> actually<00:03:01.510> when<00:03:02.139> you<00:03:02.170> making

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
thing to do is actually when you making

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.539 
thing to do is actually when you making
you<00:03:02.530> know<00:03:02.680> definition<00:03:03.159> is<00:03:03.250> give<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.489> a

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
you know definition is give it a

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.030 
you know definition is give it a
priority<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:04.030> 0<00:03:04.389> and<00:03:04.629> don't<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.409> budget<00:03:05.620> yet

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
priority of 0 and don't put a budget yet

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.199 
priority of 0 and don't put a budget yet
you<00:03:06.129> can<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.730> use<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:07.030> color

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
you can you can use this color

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.789 
you can you can use this color
definition<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.810> budge<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.290> everything<00:03:08.769> and

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
definition to budge on everything and

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.339 
definition to budge on everything and
it's<00:03:09.069> just<00:03:09.340> tons<00:03:10.030> quicker<00:03:10.450> anybody<00:03:11.109> if<00:03:11.290> you

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
it's just tons quicker anybody if you

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.569 
it's just tons quicker anybody if you
need<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.560> change<00:03:11.739> anything<00:03:12.069> that's<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> whole

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
need to change anything that's a whole

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.460 
need to change anything that's a whole
lot<00:03:12.790> quicker<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.780> do<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.900> put<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.109> badge<00:03:14.319> on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
lot quicker so do you put a badge on

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.229 
lot quicker so do you put a badge on
these<00:03:14.620> no<00:03:14.739> definitions<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.849> just<00:03:16.030> seems<00:03:16.150> to

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
these no definitions it just seems to

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.030 
these no definitions it just seems to
slow<00:03:16.450> everything<00:03:16.659> down<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.440> then<00:03:17.889> if<00:03:17.980> you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
slow everything down and then if you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.009 
slow everything down and then if you
create<00:03:18.310> quite<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.519> lot<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.819> no<00:03:19.389> definition<00:03:19.900> view

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
create quite a lot of no definition view

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.409 
create quite a lot of no definition view
badges<00:03:20.170> then<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.519> really<00:03:21.699> affect<00:03:21.849> the

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
badges then it can really affect the

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.720 
badges then it can really affect the
performance<00:03:22.540> not<00:03:23.019> cut<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.579> ridiculous

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
performance not cut it just a ridiculous

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.539 
performance not cut it just a ridiculous
amount<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:26.319> I've<00:03:26.530> actually<00:03:26.799> gone<00:03:27.099> through<00:03:27.340> all

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
amount so I've actually gone through all

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.000 
amount so I've actually gone through all
my<00:03:27.790> note<00:03:28.030> definitions<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.989> tip<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.590> taking

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
my note definitions and tip and taking

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.409 
my note definitions and tip and taking
the<00:03:30.069> budget<00:03:30.430> often<00:03:30.639> basically<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.209> have

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
the budget often basically you just have

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.059 
the budget often basically you just have
to<00:03:31.510> set<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.690> back<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.049> none<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.769> run<00:03:32.949> it

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
to set it back to none and then run it

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.349 
to set it back to none and then run it
through<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.250> day<00:03:33.280> basic<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.030> took<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.269> long

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
through a day basic and it took a long

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.449 
through a day basic and it took a long
time<00:03:34.419> but<00:03:34.810> now<00:03:35.019> my<00:03:35.500> not<00:03:35.680> cut<00:03:35.889> is<00:03:36.010> running<00:03:36.280> like

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
time but now my not cut is running like

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.610 
time but now my not cut is running like
10<00:03:37.389> times<00:03:37.720> quicker<00:03:37.989> than<00:03:38.109> what<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.349> was<00:03:38.379> before

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
10 times quicker than what it was before

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.430 
10 times quicker than what it was before

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
problems that kind of thing would bring

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.780 
problems that kind of thing would bring
up<00:03:43.840> when<00:03:44.109> I<00:03:44.139> did<00:03:44.349> he<00:03:44.410> originally<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.459> yeah<00:03:45.669> if

you if you've got not cutting you've
created<00:03:48.099> badges<00:03:48.519> like<00:03:48.669> I<00:03:48.699> said<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.569> do<00:03:49.720> bit<00:03:49.930> in

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
created badges like I said to do bit in

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.589 
created badges like I said to do bit in
their<00:03:50.230> previous<00:03:50.440> video<00:03:50.859> then<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.609> would<00:03:51.760> change

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
their previous video then I would change

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.580 
their previous video then I would change
it<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.049> then<00:03:53.560> look<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.889> worm<00:03:55.349> create<00:03:56.349> no

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
it and then look to worm create no

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.229 
it and then look to worm create no
definitions<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.280> color<00:03:57.519> definitions<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
definitions and color definitions in the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.640

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
is much better where the not definitions

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.229 
is much better where the not definitions
are<00:04:03.190> great<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:04.949> making<00:04:05.949> you<00:04:06.250> nursed<00:04:06.579> put<00:04:07.150> on

usually no definitions to be changed

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.020 
usually no definitions to be changed
into<00:04:13.060> cooler<00:04:13.269> definitions<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.989> flag<00:04:15.030> certain

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
getting out of line that's kind of the

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.020 
getting out of line that's kind of the
best<00:04:19.840> way<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.079> do<00:04:20.349> it<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.650> mean<00:04:21.430> before<00:04:21.579> that
