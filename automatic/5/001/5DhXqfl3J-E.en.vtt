any Wow alright so I'm just gonna head

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
any Wow alright so I'm just gonna head
right<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> cannot<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.809> hit<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.950> die<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
if I get hit once I guess that counts to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
if I get hit once I guess that counts to
fail<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.449> we'll<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> start<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
fail and we'll have to start from the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
fail and we'll have to start from the
beginning<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> level<00:00:56.840> this<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
beginning of the level this one and I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
beginning of the level this one and I
don't<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.370> did

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

very<00:01:06.210> few<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.049> we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
very few of you and this was one that we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 
very few of you and this was one that we
actually<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.920> three<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.760> chango

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
actually had all three of us me chango

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually had all three of us me chango
and<00:01:12.360> Nelly<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.090> skipped<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and Nelly and we actually skipped this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.160 
and Nelly and we actually skipped this
level<00:01:16.049> altogether<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.869> actually<00:01:18.869> looking

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
level altogether so actually looking

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.530 
level altogether so actually looking
back<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> probably<00:01:19.530> should<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:19.979> stayed<00:01:20.159> mini

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
where does that seems because then Mario

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.200 
where does that seems because then Mario
is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.130> smaller<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> lesser

is a little smaller and I have a lesser

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.630 
is a little smaller and I have a lesser
chance<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> getting<00:01:57.840> hit<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.020> these<00:01:58.170> things

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
chance of getting hit by these things

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
chance of getting hit by these things
it's<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> cool<00:02:01.610> well<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.000> saying

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it's kind of cool well what I was saying

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.389 
it's kind of cool well what I was saying
is<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.869> did<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> lpo<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.650> we<00:02:04.950> actually

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
is when we did the lpo this we actually

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the shortcut and we basically just skip

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.350 
the shortcut and we basically just skip
through<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.110> entire<00:02:34.470> level<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.330> is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
through this entire level so this is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.090 
through this entire level so this is
really<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> first<00:02:36.900> time<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> channel

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
this was a game that once the three of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.649 
this was a game that once the three of
us<00:03:37.430> started<00:03:37.579> playing<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.120> was<00:03:38.360> actually

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659

really<00:03:39.110> really<00:03:39.530> fun<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.510> unfortunately<00:03:41.510> we

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
really really fun and unfortunately we

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.360 
really really fun and unfortunately we
only<00:03:41.659> had<00:03:42.019> Nellie<00:03:42.230> for<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> path<00:03:42.950> for

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
only had Nellie for like the path for

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.559 
only had Nellie for like the path for
the<00:03:43.459> last<00:03:43.670> stone<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:46.220> one<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.120> half<00:03:47.150> rolls

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
the last stone like one and a half rolls

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.360 
the last stone like one and a half rolls
of<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> game<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.799> would<00:03:48.980> be<00:03:49.099> really<00:03:49.250> cool

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
of the game so it would be really cool

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.429 
of the game so it would be really cool
to<00:03:49.519> see<00:03:49.640> NLP<00:03:49.970> with<00:03:50.299> all<00:03:50.599> of<00:03:50.810> us<00:03:50.930> playing<00:03:51.200> for
