00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.059
 O 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:31.029
 ah 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.029
 ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:28.850
 is where they saw a game their team against 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.570
 counter- lux is a very 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.300
 compact to use good good speed well 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.300
 quality is in the rhythm of competition 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.390
 we talk a lot with the technical committee 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 and also talked to the players 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.400
 that we wanted from each one 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 the way we work the goal 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.110
 which we wanted very well, very well clear 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.020
 we explain the work that we 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.229
 we will have to train as if it were a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.830
 game with very close to the rhythm game 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.170
 dynamic pressure emotional side because 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.489
 When we get on the field we go 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 facing opponents who wanted and 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.190
 They want to hit Brazil at every moment. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.010
 each training has a very clear objective 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.540
 well defined what we want from the player 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.820
 that the Brazilian player 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.560
 he is smart when you make a 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.090
 training it to adapt fast 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.739
 then you have to do another 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.560
 rule already has to change the training 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.930
 another good momentum is for him 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.950
 can strive more in the traditional already 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.850
 Can you capture Brazil well? 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.580
 have top players 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.480
 the players who want to play 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.480
 they like to play
