00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.090

 We're going over there 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.290
 then now 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.290
 with the uploads 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.530
 filling 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:21.989

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:29.550
 I knew where the hole was 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.550
 this is done 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.320

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.989
