00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
protein powder I have them in between a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
protein powder I have them in between a
lot<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.829> different<00:01:55.860> proteins<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:57.240> now

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
lot of different proteins right now

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.730 
lot of different proteins right now
that's<00:01:57.600> another<00:01:57.930> question<00:01:58.140> I'll<00:01:58.500> I'll

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that's another question I'll I'll

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
that's another question I'll I'll
address<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> question<00:02:00.000> too<00:02:00.149> but

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
address that in this question too but

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.859 
address that in this question too but
right<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.590> quest<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.969> SF<00:02:03.509> agne

that<00:02:30.520> since<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:30.910> they've<00:02:31.060> taken<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
that since then they've taken out the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.620 
that since then they've taken out the
faedron<00:02:32.320> was<00:02:32.560> what<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.670> made<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:34.030> heart<00:02:34.210> go<00:02:34.330> so

then that was the only time in my life
that<00:02:39.490> actually<00:02:40.030> tried<00:02:40.240> something<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.290> was

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
that actually tried something it was

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.560 
that actually tried something it was
just<00:02:41.800> something<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.520> experiment<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.270> um

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
just something in the experiment but um

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.720 
just something in the experiment but um
I<00:02:43.780> don't<00:02:44.320> believe<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.650> detox<00:02:44.950> heat<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.400> believe

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
I don't believe in detox heat I believe

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.820 
I don't believe in detox heat I believe

going<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> combine<00:02:52.330> into<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.070> what<00:02:54.070> are<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
going to combine into one what are the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.150 
going to combine into one what are the
first<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.870> was<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.170> first<00:02:56.380> thing<00:02:56.620> you
