ATS inspect is a visual defect tracking

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.540 
ATS inspect is a visual defect tracking
tool<00:00:07.220> that<00:00:07.910> allows<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.570> inspector<00:00:09.440> to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
tool that allows the inspector to

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.740 
tool that allows the inspector to
identify<00:00:10.550> and<00:00:10.880> record<00:00:12.070> quality<00:00:13.070> defects<00:00:13.790> the

system<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.200> quite<00:00:15.320> simple<00:00:15.830> to<00:00:15.860> use<00:00:15.980> and<00:00:16.550> that

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
system is quite simple to use and that

I'll press ok with my finger and then

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.069 
I'll press ok with my finger and then
we'd<00:00:44.450> identify<00:00:45.050> for<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> list<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.800> views<00:00:47.079> where

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
we'd identify for a list of views where

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.810 
we'd identify for a list of views where
we<00:00:48.410> would<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.710> inspect<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:49.430> let's

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
we would like to inspect so let's

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.300 
we would like to inspect so let's
imagine<00:00:49.970> I'm<00:00:50.360> checking<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.220> inspecting<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
imagine I'm checking the inspecting the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.729 
imagine I'm checking the inspecting the
top<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.760> car<00:00:52.970> I<00:00:53.210> simply<00:00:54.170> touch<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:54.620> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
top of the car I simply touch it and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.950 
top of the car I simply touch it and
then<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.370> front<00:00:55.579> of<00:00:55.700> me<00:00:55.820> I'm<00:00:55.910> faced<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:56.390> three

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
then in front of me I'm faced with three

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.430 
then in front of me I'm faced with three
areas<00:00:57.440> which<00:00:57.620> are<00:00:57.770> shaded<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.720> roof<00:00:59.720> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
areas which are shaded the roof the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.119 
areas which are shaded the roof the
bonnet<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.220> course<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.800> boots<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:03.950> well

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
bonnet and of course the boots as well

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.780 
bonnet and of course the boots as well
so<00:01:04.489> if<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:05.540> then<00:01:06.290> select<00:01:06.710> an<00:01:06.950> area<00:01:07.340> where<00:01:07.580> find

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
so if we then select an area where find

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.020 
so if we then select an area where find
a<00:01:07.850> defect<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:09.260> give<00:01:09.500> us<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
a defect it will then give us a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.610 
a defect it will then give us a
selection<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.240> concerns<00:01:11.720> which<00:01:12.170> are<00:01:12.350> relevant

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
selection of concerns which are relevant

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.160 
selection of concerns which are relevant
to<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:12.920> particular<00:01:13.130> area<00:01:13.670> as<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.140> says<00:01:15.140> here

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
to that particular area as it says here

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.399 
to that particular area as it says here
top<00:01:16.040> roof<00:01:16.400> we'd<00:01:17.180> say<00:01:17.390> we<00:01:17.510> find<00:01:17.750> perhaps<00:01:18.049> found

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
top roof we'd say we find perhaps found

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.770 
top roof we'd say we find perhaps found
a<00:01:18.500> crater<00:01:19.030> I've<00:01:20.030> consider<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.570> be<00:01:20.690> a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
a crater I've consider that to be a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.420 
a crater I've consider that to be a
major<00:01:20.990> defects<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.650> if<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.830> wanted<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.250> we

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
major defects and if you wanted to we

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.670 
major defects and if you wanted to we
could<00:01:22.460> even<00:01:22.729> capture<00:01:23.270> an<00:01:23.420> image<00:01:23.840> or<00:01:24.350> acquire

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
could even capture an image or acquire

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.110 
could even capture an image or acquire
an<00:01:24.920> image<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.420> we<00:01:26.420> select<00:01:26.750> ok<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:28.120> then

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
an image of that we select ok and then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.719 
an image of that we select ok and then
we<00:01:29.270> will<00:01:29.390> given<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.930> flag<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.680> where<00:01:31.610> that

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
we will given a flag of where that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.550 
we will given a flag of where that
defect<00:01:32.119> occurred<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.110> actually<00:01:33.229> change

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
defect occurred we can actually change

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.359 
defect occurred we can actually change
that<00:01:33.920> into<00:01:34.159> more<00:01:34.610> like<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:35.000> measles

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
that into more like a measles

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.710 
that into more like a measles
identification<00:01:37.369> if<00:01:37.549> depending<00:01:38.299> upon<00:01:38.540> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
identification if depending upon the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.560 
identification if depending upon the
graphics<00:01:39.080> preferred<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:41.000> we're<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.360> looking

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
graphics preferred if we're now looking

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.600 
graphics preferred if we're now looking
at<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.110> bite<00:01:42.260> area<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.979> maybe<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:43.310> find<00:01:43.460> an

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
at the bite area and maybe we find an

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.039 
at the bite area and maybe we find an
area<00:01:43.820> where<00:01:44.299> defect<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.869> located<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.490> then

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
area where defect is located we can then

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.289 
area where defect is located we can then
select<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.530> relevant<00:01:48.950> area<00:01:49.490> as<00:01:49.700> best<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.060> can

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
select the relevant area as best we can

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.780 
select the relevant area as best we can
with<00:01:50.540> our<00:01:50.570> finger<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:52.130> might<00:01:52.340> be<00:01:52.549> for

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
with our finger and that might be for

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.539 
with our finger and that might be for
example<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:53.390> clear<00:01:53.630> coat<00:01:53.840> sag<00:01:54.200> that's<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.310> fairly

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
example a clear coat sag that's a fairly

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.690 
example a clear coat sag that's a fairly
major<00:01:55.820> defect<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:56.840> click<00:01:57.110> OK<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.710> then<00:01:58.490> we'll

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
major defect but click OK and then we'll

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060 
major defect but click OK and then we'll
have<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> representation<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.439> defect<00:02:00.860> on

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
have a representation of the defect on

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.430 
have a representation of the defect on
