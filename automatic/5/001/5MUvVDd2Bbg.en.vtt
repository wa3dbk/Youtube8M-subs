this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> mock<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.060> Maytag<00:00:03.659> washing<00:00:03.959> machine

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
this is a mock a Maytag washing machine

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.970 
this is a mock a Maytag washing machine
its<00:00:04.920> model<00:00:05.370> numbered<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:08.000> 882<00:00:09.139> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.620> saw<00:00:10.800> this

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
its model numbered a 882 and I saw this

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.039 
its model numbered a 882 and I saw this
in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> trash<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.730> morning<00:00:12.120> there<00:00:12.929> was

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
in the trash this morning there was

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.799 
in the trash this morning there was
another<00:00:13.670> that<00:00:14.670> was<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.820> Kenmore<00:00:15.059> dryer<00:00:15.570> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
another that was a Kenmore dryer that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.090 
another that was a Kenmore dryer that
was<00:00:15.929> sitting<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> side<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
was sitting on the side of it at the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.880 
was sitting on the side of it at the
same<00:00:17.250> garbage<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.600> usually<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:19.619> somebody

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
same garbage and usually if somebody

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.700 
same garbage and usually if somebody
throws<00:00:20.310> away<00:00:20.460> both<00:00:20.869> either<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.680> other

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
throws away both either one of the other

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.240 
throws away both either one of the other
has<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> good<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:25.320> thought<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
has to be good and I thought of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.920 
has to be good and I thought of
scrapping<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.660> picked

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
scrapping this because I just picked

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.050 
scrapping this because I just picked
them<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> scrap<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.130> since<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
them up for a scrap but since it was a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.380 
them up for a scrap but since it was a
Maytag<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.660> made<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.019> exception<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.700> far<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Maytag I made an exception and so far so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.979 
Maytag I made an exception and so far so
good<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.630> put<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> spin<00:00:34.590> cycle<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.989> only

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
good I put it on the spin cycle and only

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
good I put it on the spin cycle and only
when<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.290> put<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> spin<00:00:37.980> cycle<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
when I put it on the spin cycle the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
when I put it on the spin cycle the
timer<00:00:38.790> move<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.290> good<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
timer move so I know that's good and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
timer move so I know that's good and
know<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.610> running<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.030> through<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.300> cycle<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
know I'm running it through a cycle of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
know I'm running it through a cycle of
its<00:00:43.170> own<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> garden<00:00:44.190> hose<00:00:44.370> hooked<00:00:44.579> up

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
its own I got the garden hose hooked up

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.779 
its own I got the garden hose hooked up
to<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.770> gutter<00:00:46.770> guard<00:00:46.980> close<00:00:47.160> enough<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to the gutter guard close enough to this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.680 
to the gutter guard close enough to this
cold<00:00:48.090> terminal<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> took<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:50.690> Russian

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cold terminal and then I took my Russian

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.970 
cold terminal and then I took my Russian
fill<00:00:51.930> cap<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.949> GMC<00:00:53.489> van<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.230> put<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
fill cap on my GMC van and I put it on

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.119 
fill cap on my GMC van and I put it on
hot<00:00:56.520> terminal<00:00:57.300> temporarily<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
hot terminal temporarily because if you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
hot terminal temporarily because if you
don't<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> cab<00:00:59.910> they'll<00:01:00.239> start<00:01:00.570> leaking

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
don't got a cab they'll start leaking

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.460 
don't got a cab they'll start leaking
the<00:01:01.020> water<00:01:01.199> will<00:01:01.379> start<00:01:01.530> leaking<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:02.270> but

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
the water will start leaking out but

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.630 
the water will start leaking out but
yeah<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.830> far<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.129> good

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
yeah so far so good

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
yeah so far so good
the<00:01:06.540> timer<00:01:06.810> works<00:01:07.170> great<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.890> water<00:01:08.100> level

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the timer works great the water level

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
the timer works great the water level
works<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.630> small<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
works good I had it on small and now I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
works good I had it on small and now I
got<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.549> extra-large<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> don't

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
got it on on extra-large so I don't

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.370 
got it on on extra-large so I don't
spill<00:01:13.020> enough<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:15.170> there's<00:01:16.170> no

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
spill enough all right and there's no

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
spill enough all right and there's no
leaks<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> drum<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.610> drum<00:01:17.640> sweating<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
leaks in the drum the drum sweating a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
leaks in the drum the drum sweating a
little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.290> probably<00:01:19.530> probably

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
little bit because probably probably

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.870 
little bit because probably probably
because<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> water<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.860> ice<00:01:23.070> cold<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because the water is ice cold and the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
because the water is ice cold and the
drum<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:25.400> there's<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.549> pump<00:01:26.850> leaks<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.740> yeah

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
drum and there's no pump leaks and yeah

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
drum and there's no pump leaks and yeah
the<00:01:28.979> co<00:01:29.220> leak<00:01:29.520> underneath<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> drum<00:01:30.840> it's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the co leak underneath the drum it's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130 
the co leak underneath the drum it's
pretty<00:01:31.380> solid<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> thing<00:01:33.869> looks<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pretty solid and this thing looks like

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
pretty solid and this thing looks like
it<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> newer<00:01:34.829> motor<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.270> that's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it has a newer motor in it and that's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.090 
it has a newer motor in it and that's
cool<00:01:37.460> yeah<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.900> rarely<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.290> old<00:01:40.560> mate<00:01:40.829> eggs

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cool yeah I rarely see old mate eggs

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.969 
cool yeah I rarely see old mate eggs
honor<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> garbage<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.770> got<00:01:43.799> one

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
honor to garbage we got one we got one

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.910 
honor to garbage we got one we got one
in<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.340> basement<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> 1984<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.649> got

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
in our basement that's a 1984 my my got

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.480 
in our basement that's a 1984 my my got
it<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.299> 10<00:01:48.600> years<00:01:48.630> old<00:01:49.310> back<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it when I was like 10 years old back in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.330 
it when I was like 10 years old back in
1984<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> thing<00:01:51.960> still<00:01:52.290> runs<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.860> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
1984 and that thing still runs good it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370 
1984 and that thing still runs good it's
noisy<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.880> hell<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.329> cabinets<00:01:54.780> frosty<00:01:55.170> with

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
noisy as hell the cabinets frosty with

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.419 
noisy as hell the cabinets frosty with
that<00:01:56.369> thing

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
that thing

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.569 
that thing
I've<00:01:57.909> won<00:01:58.149> forever<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.500> probably<00:01:59.740> has<00:01:59.950> as<00:02:00.340> much

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
I've won forever it probably has as much

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.179 
I've won forever it probably has as much
miles<00:02:00.909> with<00:02:01.149> my<00:02:01.329> GMC<00:02:01.869> van<00:02:02.109> like<00:02:02.649> maybe<00:02:03.100> even

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
miles with my GMC van like maybe even

yeah there's no leaks and underneath the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.730 
yeah there's no leaks and underneath the
key<00:02:23.850> underneath<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.290> underneath<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> washer

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
key underneath the underneath the washer

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.200 
key underneath the underneath the washer
I<00:02:26.770> put<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> piece<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.310> cardboard<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.970> there's

no like no drips or anything so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.080 
no like no drips or anything so
everything's<00:02:31.930> perfect<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:33.760> that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
everything's perfect so I think that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.700 
everything's perfect so I think that
Kenmore<00:02:34.540> dryer<00:02:34.840> was<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.110> piece<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.680> that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
Kenmore dryer was a piece of that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.380 
Kenmore dryer was a piece of that
was<00:02:35.920> thrown<00:02:36.100> on<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> garbage<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.000> they<00:02:37.150> just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
was thrown on the garbage and they just

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.030 
was thrown on the garbage and they just
decided<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> new<00:02:38.260> pair<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.710> people

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
decided to get a new pair the people

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.870 
decided to get a new pair the people
that<00:02:39.190> threw<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> salt<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.370> washer<00:02:42.730> was

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
that threw the salt and the washer was

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.240 
that threw the salt and the washer was
probably<00:02:43.210> good<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.480> begin<00:02:43.720> with<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.920> they<00:02:45.070> just

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
probably good to begin with so they just

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.330 
probably good to begin with so they just
replace<00:02:45.640> both<00:02:45.970> both<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.840> washer<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.290> dryer

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.830

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.670 
so because everybody wants things
