00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.089
 Hello everyone welcome to ixtem motorcycle 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.889
 for a new video 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.990
 so today the products that I have 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.549
 with me these are pants for motorcycles 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 from the brand dsquared a brand 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.840
 French who devoted himself to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.300
 develop a range of pants that 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.980
 uses the aesthetic codes of jeans 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.810
 but who offers protection 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.640
 equivalent to or even greater than 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.990
 leather type pants for motorcycle then 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.490
 you have to know that the squad has 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.710
 developed to arrive at this result there 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.130
 a particular fiber called 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.720
 art told me patented fiber and which are 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.850
 totally or partially 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.590
 happened then the first product 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 that I have with me is precisely the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.210
 produces a little emblematic of the brand 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.850
 it's the strong model so it's the one 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 it is realized entirely in weapons 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.900
 to it so this famous fiber 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.560
 reinforced you see that in terms 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.480
 aesthetic 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.310
 it looks like you can be mistaken for jeans 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 we find plenty of pockets everywhere a 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:05.650
 urban style quite contemporary to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.680
 inside you'll see we're going 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.110
 find small pockets 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.970
 and if at the knees and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.229
 hips that are intended to accommodate 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.479
 approved protections 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.690
 if you still want to increase the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.280
 level of protection and then on this 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 model but as on the others we have 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.950
 reinforced seams which allows in 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.600
 fall case that the pants do not 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.000
 share not play because you can 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.860
 have a very strong fiber but if 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270
 the pants parents piece when you 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.520
 fall it does not matter much 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.380
 So that's the strong 100% to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.040
 malta then we have a version a little 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.820
 little more light 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.500
 in the quads it's polonium then 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.540
 it's a product here that's going to be 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.159
 composed for half of weapons to it and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.320
 for half of traditional cotton 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.850
 so obviously tears at it's 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.380
 positioned at strategic locations 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 more exposed in the event of a fall on 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.430
 knees and hips and buttocks 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.650
 there is a little protection 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 at the buttocks in nomex which 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.400
 protects the diffusion of heat 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.390
 since when you fall it is not 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.040
 rare that they warm up to the level 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 buttocks 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.470
 hop here for the interior we find 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.360
 again our little pockets at the level 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 knees and hips here for 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 accommodate approved protections 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 this and always our seams reinforced 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.150
 one sees well all that runs apart 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.370
 the pants so that's the polonium 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.030
 and last come in the jeans range 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.800
 squad 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.740
 this is my third and last model 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.280
 it's the wrong trip so here we are on 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 a more traditional product in the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.800
 meaning where it is not composed of weapons has 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 says so this is a product that is 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.810
 made entirely of NÃ®mes cotton and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.360
 risk areas where they squad has 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.100
 added kevlar costs 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.180
 so here we are on a more construction 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.440
 traditional that we will be able 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.270
 find at other manufacturers 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.670
 but here it comes to complete the range 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.959
 squad and we always find that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.280
 it's a constant before their products 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.610
 small locations for 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.739
 hip and knee protection here 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.470
 that was the wrong trip I 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.290
 put backwards but it does not matter 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.670
 so here with these three products then 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.050
 we must expect unfortunately it is 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.300
 lower body protection which is a 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.380
 rarely neglected so with the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.090
 products of the sco what is cool 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.459
 that you can keep an urban look 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 with a product type jean and have 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 really effective protection so 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.950
 must not deprive 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.549
 thank you for your attention and see you soon 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.549
 for new videos
