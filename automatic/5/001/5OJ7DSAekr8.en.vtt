00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
gun like this one and I'm going to get

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.770 
gun like this one and I'm going to get
into<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.890> why<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.909> best<00:03:06.090> gun<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.540> let's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
into that why it's the best gun so let's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 
into that why it's the best gun so let's
let's<00:03:06.989> talk<00:03:07.230> about<00:03:07.379> its<00:03:07.739> it's<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.190> damaged<00:03:09.150> and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
let's talk about its it's a damaged and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.899 
let's talk about its it's a damaged and
whatnot<00:03:09.890> first<00:03:10.890> off<00:03:11.069> its<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.370> semi-automatic

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
whatnot first off its a semi-automatic

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.490 
whatnot first off its a semi-automatic
gun<00:03:12.209> meaning<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.050> hit<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> trigger

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
gun meaning you have to hit the trigger

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
gun meaning you have to hit the trigger
every<00:03:13.800> time<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.099> want<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> shoot<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.780> you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
every time you want to shoot it and you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.390 
every time you want to shoot it and you
know<00:03:15.810> obviously<00:03:16.110> these<00:03:16.560> guns<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
know obviously these guns have a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.880 
know obviously these guns have a
weakness<00:03:17.670> because<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.930> semi-automatic<00:03:19.769> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
weakness because it's semi-automatic and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670 
weakness because it's semi-automatic and
you<00:03:20.849> have<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.090> shoot<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.650> know

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
you have to shoot it but you know

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.110 
you have to shoot it but you know
obviously<00:03:23.099> these<00:03:23.489> guns<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.909> a<00:03:23.940> higher

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
obviously these guns have a higher

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.580 
obviously these guns have a higher
damage<00:03:24.420> because<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.110> they<00:03:25.290> would<00:03:25.319> have<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
damage because then they would have to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.309 
damage because then they would have to
balance<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.569> guns<00:03:27.569> like<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.959> they

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
balance that out so guns like this they

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.110 
balance that out so guns like this they
are<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.709> complete<00:03:29.099> beast<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.879> game

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
are just complete beast in this game

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.710 
are just complete beast in this game
first<00:03:30.810> off<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.379> damage<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.519> does<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.060> it's

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
first off the damage it does is it it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.660 
first off the damage it does is it it's
a<00:03:33.840> two-bit<00:03:34.170> kill<00:03:34.409> at<00:03:34.650> any<00:03:34.830> range<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.430> map

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
a two-bit kill at any range in this map

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.910 
a two-bit kill at any range in this map
aventa<00:03:36.120> which<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.420> why<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.629> is<00:03:36.959> best<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:37.650> small

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
aventa which is why it is best for small

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250 
aventa which is why it is best for small
maps<00:03:38.159> like<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.640> even<00:03:39.330> though<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
maps like this even though it is a it's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.949 
maps like this even though it is a it's
still<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.620> two<00:03:40.890> or<00:03:40.920> three<00:03:41.310> hit<00:03:41.519> kill<00:03:42.330> any<00:03:42.659> range

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
still a two or three hit kill any range

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.140 
still a two or three hit kill any range
even<00:03:43.500> really<00:03:44.010> really<00:03:44.250> far<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.790> three<00:03:45.000> get

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
even really really far it's a three get

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.570 
even really really far it's a three get
kill<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.680> guns<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.310> are

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
kill and you know guns like this are

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.869 
kill and you know guns like this are
beast<00:03:47.819> but<00:03:48.269> its<00:03:49.200> best<00:03:49.500> it's<00:03:49.980> best<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.519> maps

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
beast but its best it's best on maps

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.729 
beast but its best it's best on maps
like<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.330> Havana<00:03:51.720> because<00:03:52.140> no<00:03:52.290> matter<00:03:52.439> where

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
like this Havana because no matter where

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.320 
like this Havana because no matter where
the<00:03:52.950> enemy<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.280> you'll<00:03:53.640> still<00:03:53.879> hit<00:03:54.060> them<00:03:54.180> with

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
the enemy is you'll still hit them with

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.119 
the enemy is you'll still hit them with
two<00:03:54.480> bullets<00:03:54.629> and<00:03:54.989> you'll<00:03:55.650> still<00:03:55.860> kill<00:03:56.040> them

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
two bullets and you'll still kill them

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.300 
two bullets and you'll still kill them
so<00:03:56.909> my<00:03:57.180> suggestion<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.409> guys<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.950> to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
so my suggestion is to you guys up to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.399 
so my suggestion is to you guys up to
use<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.909> on<00:04:00.030> smaller<00:04:00.330> maps<00:04:00.569> such<00:04:00.810> as<00:04:00.989> firing

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
use it on smaller maps such as firing

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.280 
use it on smaller maps such as firing
range<00:04:01.620> or<00:04:01.819> Havana<00:04:02.819> like<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.269> map<00:04:03.450> because

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
range or Havana like this map because

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.020 
range or Havana like this map because
they<00:04:04.470> cut<00:04:04.650> out<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.920> two<00:04:05.099> things<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
they cut out the two things it's not the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.420 
they cut out the two things it's not the
full<00:04:06.180> size<00:04:06.450> map<00:04:06.750> but<00:04:07.409> uh<00:04:07.439> you<00:04:07.860> know<00:04:07.950> use<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:08.310> on

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
full size map but uh you know use it on

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.399 
full size map but uh you know use it on
guns<00:04:08.640> use<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.209> all<00:04:09.299> maps<00:04:09.480> like<00:04:09.689> this<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.140> gun

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
guns use it all maps like this this gun

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.170 
guns use it all maps like this this gun
will<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.830> tear<00:04:11.040> tear<00:04:11.459> stuff<00:04:11.670> up<00:04:11.879> in<00:04:12.030> this

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
will just tear tear stuff up in this

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.229 
will just tear tear stuff up in this
Matt<00:04:12.530> second<00:04:13.530> tip<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.280> m14<00:04:14.760> would<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.060> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
Matt second tip for the m14 would be to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.840 
Matt second tip for the m14 would be to
use<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.829> grip<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.009> it<00:04:17.040> because<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.459> has<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.609> lot

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
use the grip on it because it has a lot

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.810 
use the grip on it because it has a lot
of<00:04:17.880> recoil<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:19.889> know<00:04:20.009> it<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.609> bounce

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
of recoil and you know it can bounce

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.909 
of recoil and you know it can bounce
pretty<00:04:21.150> high<00:04:21.269> up<00:04:21.299> there<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.810> stuff<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:22.860> that

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
pretty high up there and stuff like that

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.740 
pretty high up there and stuff like that
so<00:04:23.250> i<00:04:23.280> would<00:04:23.610> suggest<00:04:23.820> using<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.360> grip<00:04:24.570> that's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
so i would suggest using a grip that's

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.690 
so i would suggest using a grip that's

what I'm using here I slapped a grip on

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.470
