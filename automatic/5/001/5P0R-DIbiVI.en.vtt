00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the puzzle that you get the turning is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
the puzzle that you get the turning is
fantastic<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.940> smooth<00:00:24.270> but<00:00:24.540> punchy<00:00:24.930> feel

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
fantastic with a smooth but punchy feel

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500 
fantastic with a smooth but punchy feel
on<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.440> outer<00:00:25.620> layers<00:00:25.950> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.060> because<00:00:27.360> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
on the outer layers this is because the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.029 
on the outer layers this is because the
ridges<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.930> been<00:00:28.080> removed<00:00:28.440> on<00:00:28.620> the<00:00:28.680> edges

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
ridges have been removed on the edges

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.770 
ridges have been removed on the edges
which<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.520> what<00:00:29.730> makes<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.120> cube<00:00:30.420> different

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
which is what makes this cube different

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.229 
which is what makes this cube different
from<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> version<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.730> second<00:00:33.059> layers

Cuban future versions the corner kerning

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
Cuban future versions the corner kerning
is<00:00:52.649> remarkable<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> version<00:00:53.579> 5<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
is remarkable in the version 5 well the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
is remarkable in the version 5 well the
full<00:00:54.960> piece<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.739> fluid<00:00:56.070> corner-cutting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
full piece of easy fluid corner-cutting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
full piece of easy fluid corner-cutting
the<00:00:57.030> fluorine<00:00:57.360> mana<00:00:57.570> isn't<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.110> needed

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the fluorine mana isn't really needed

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.979 
the fluorine mana isn't really needed
for<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:58.710> however<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.820> barely<00:01:00.270> reverse<00:01:00.690> cuts

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
for once however it barely reverse cuts

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.690 
for once however it barely reverse cuts
so<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.070> cube<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.460> top-notch

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
so if you want your cube to be top-notch

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700 
so if you want your cube to be top-notch
you<00:01:03.239> might<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> fluorine<00:01:04.350> mod<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you might want to do the fluorine mod to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
you might want to do the fluorine mod to
the<00:01:04.829> corners<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.759> cube<00:01:06.000> does<00:01:06.210> occasionally

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the corners the cube does occasionally

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
the corners the cube does occasionally
lock<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.590> enough<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.009> really<00:01:08.219> screw

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
lock up but not enough to really screw

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.929 
lock up but not enough to really screw
you<00:01:08.759> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you up

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.699 
you up
another<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> found<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> inner

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:10.709 
another thing I found is that the inner

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:12.559 
another thing I found is that the inner
mechanisms<00:01:11.219> can<00:01:11.429> surmount<00:01:11.789> alignment<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
mechanisms can surmount alignment I

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.330 
mechanisms can surmount alignment I
wasn't<00:01:13.139> able<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.499> it<00:01:13.679> happen<00:01:14.009> in<00:01:14.219> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
wasn't able to have it happen in the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.669 
wasn't able to have it happen in the
video<00:01:14.579> that<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.929> my<00:01:16.049> cube<00:01:16.499> dough

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
video that could just be my cube dough

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.230 
video that could just be my cube dough
so<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.249> subtle<00:01:17.459> happen<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so I don't know subtle happen to you

explosions but other than that the cube

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
explosions but other than that the cube
is<00:01:24.569> fine<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.469> size<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.889> this<00:01:25.950> puzzle<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.399> the

is fine the size of this puzzle is the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
is fine the size of this puzzle is the

the stock stickers were dull and boring
as<00:01:33.450> usual<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.469> course<00:01:34.649> I<00:01:34.829> replaced<00:01:35.159> them

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
as usual so of course I replaced them

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.949 
as usual so of course I replaced them

cube<00:01:47.789> is<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> step<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.719> version<00:01:48.959> 4<00:01:49.349> if

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
cube is a step up from the version 4 if

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.589 
cube is a step up from the version 4 if
shangzhou<00:01:50.249> were<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.849> pre<00:01:51.090> cast<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.539> out

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
shangzhou were to just pre cast them out

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.389 
shangzhou were to just pre cast them out
therefore<00:01:51.659> f-4s<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.859> cube<00:01:53.159> would<00:01:53.279> be

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
therefore f-4s this cube would be

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.789 
therefore f-4s this cube would be
perfect<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:54.959> all<00:01:55.200> I've<00:01:55.289> got<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.469> say<00:01:55.590> in
