00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hi today I'm gonna show you how 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.410
 makeup look makes with all of them 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.940
 budgetproof products that you simply buy 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.440
 the etos can buy 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 it is namely make-up mania at etos 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 the fact that there are many actions 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.920
 a check the website below for the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 let's start current actions 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 I start with basic products and as 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.550
 first I bring this skin smoothing 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 primer of etos own brand to this is 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 a kind of charlie product and it is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.320
 transparent and it spreads over mine 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.660
 entire face 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.670
 as a basis under my foundation 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 before all lines are filled 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 that the skin becomes completely smooth so you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 also no longer sees the pores completely 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 clear because this product ensures it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.500
 that it is all totally beautiful and smooth 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 so this is the basis on my 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 face also apply it under the eyes 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 and then i go eye shadow base 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.020
 applying this is the other eyeshadow 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 base of etos own brand and I bring this 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 on my eyelids and all the way down 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 my eyebrow some eye shadow all the way 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.559
 stays in place now sits 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.390
 basically it was all about it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.340
 and by using these products week 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 everything is fine I now continue with the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 maxfactor facefinity all day flawless 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.990
 foundation I use it very often 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 video is really my favorite 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 foundation example because yes on photos 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 my video makes my skin look super smooth 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 when I use this and I bring this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 just put my fingers on the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 base I just applied 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 and you will see that it is very nicely even 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.150
 and smooth applying which makes me a beautiful 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.520
 airbrush the finish and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.259
 and now I'm going to apply concealer this is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 the bright non concealer of etos own 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 brand and this is kind of touche eclat 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 great product but just a lot 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.650
 keywords and apply under my eyes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.970
 but also worth something in my corner of the eye 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.740
 is darker 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.899
 and I kind of pat my finger on it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.829
 it blurs nicely in the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.329
 foundation de see there equal frichard 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.820
 then you going to apply a cream blush 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.950
 from bourjois and this is a nice peachy 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.329
 color and I just apply it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 dab a little with my fingers 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.420
 and over the apples from my cheeks 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.790
 going in that takes a bit 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.740
 half-smiling you see just right 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.420
 where the color should and you can do a whole 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.829
 easy to assemble so a little bit 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 and it immediately gives a nice one 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.960
 fresh peecher look now an eye shadow 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.760
 of rimmel in a beautiful 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.860
 slightly tinted and I bring it with it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 sponge on my eyelid 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.390
 is above the eyelashes and also a small one 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.940
 bit under the eyebrow as 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.890
 highlighter and when I'm in a hurry you sit 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.060
 however easiest favorite way of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 just apply your eye shadow 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.410
 highlighter eyelid under the eyebrow and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.660
 then a darker color in this case 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.830
 this purple hue from the box of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.420
 l'orÃ©al 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.430
 I use a bit of a fluffy brush 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.840
 that cock in it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.840
 then go into my arcade arch 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.500
 what I do more recently what I do 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 personally very nice is that i like it 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.130
 a bit fade to the left to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.140
 right to left and right and keep going 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.790
 do something more to my nose and if I do 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.320
 think i'm ready to take us in a go 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.870
 a little bit further is even more 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.040
 fade towards my nose 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.780
 at first it seems a bit 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.850
 crazy that feels crazy but it is that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.850
 pretty nice that way 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.630
 paul a difference where with left and 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.370
 right corner of the eye also briefly 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.610
 then I will take you and the sponge applicator 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.140
 I put a line under my eye and 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.150
 he might have noticed that I 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.760
 warm and cool actually combine in 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.200
 purple eye shadow and warm piet showbiz 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.920
 but that is fine that is quite nice 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.130
 but you have to be very careful and me 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 now continue with eyeliner and this is the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.360
 eyeliner from maybelline called master 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.430
 duo and they have a kind of spain chips 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.590
 you work with a bullet on it 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.510
 easy and eyeliner gives something 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.430
 you will only see extra depth on the right 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.490
 with eyeliner and here I have on both 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.440
 my eyes fallopian tube now the lip gloss this is 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.290
 from etos own brand lip gloss in one 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.850
 peachy color and especially do not want here 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.260
 to bright orange color my then goes 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.000
 it is really cursing but this way 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.880
 it just soft and 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 is it cute than the mascara de mac 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.880

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.340
 hypo-allergenic mascara from etos own 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.840

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.360
 nice and affordable 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.160
