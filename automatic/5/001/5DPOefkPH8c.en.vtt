00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.679 

it<00:00:02.340> wasn't<00:00:02.610> girls<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> was<00:00:03.300> thinking<00:00:03.629> about

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
it wasn't girls so I was thinking about

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.690 
it wasn't girls so I was thinking about
the<00:00:03.990> fact<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.380> people<00:00:04.620> are<00:00:04.799> graduating<00:00:05.069> now

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the fact that people are graduating now

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.870 
the fact that people are graduating now
and<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.690> made<00:00:06.990> me<00:00:07.200> think<00:00:07.230> back<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.250> when<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
and it made me think back to when I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640 
and it made me think back to when I
graduated<00:00:09.599> both<00:00:09.870> high<00:00:10.080> school<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.410> college

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
it but we definitely go through the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.590 
it but we definitely go through the
