00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
and I try to do thin line because I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.550 
and I try to do thin line because I
always<00:01:15.800> mess<00:01:16.010> up<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:17.050> always<00:01:18.050> have<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.470> it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
always mess up so I always have to do it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:30.940 
always mess up so I always have to do it
thicker

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.480 

and<00:01:31.610> then<00:01:31.969> towards<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.450> end<00:01:32.950> I'm<00:01:33.950> at<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.130> little

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
and then towards the end I'm at a little

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.749 
and then towards the end I'm at a little
bit<00:01:34.610> more<00:01:34.729> product<00:01:38.860> towards<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.039> end<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.750> just

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229

line and I just lift it up sorry I

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.779

really<00:01:49.640> do<00:01:49.819> not<00:01:49.939> know<00:01:50.119> how<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.299> explain<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.780> I

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:16.720 

have<00:01:55.789> trouble<00:01:56.060> myself<00:01:56.360> with<00:01:56.780> eyeliner

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.089 

I<00:02:16.819> think<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:17.810> one<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.019> thinner<00:02:18.470> than<00:02:18.620> this

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
I think this one is thinner than this

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:42.070 
I think this one is thinner than this
one

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:03:08.050 

I'm<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:42.800> gonna<00:02:42.980> leave<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.580> that

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.949 

I<00:03:08.120> know<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:09.050> definitely<00:03:09.890> not<00:03:10.040> straight<00:03:10.520> but

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
I know it's definitely not straight but

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.460 
I know it's definitely not straight but
like<00:03:11.959> i<00:03:12.080> said<00:03:12.110> i<00:03:12.319> do<00:03:12.440> have<00:03:12.709> trouble<00:03:13.099> myself<00:03:14.470> now

collects<00:04:23.560> stick<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.220> because<00:04:24.430> if<00:04:24.460> it's<00:04:24.850> not

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
it all like lift up and then I'll have

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:48.660 
it all like lift up and then I'll have
more<00:04:27.100> trouble<00:04:27.370> with<00:04:27.550> it

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.130 

I'm<00:04:49.670> going<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:49.940> try<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.180> add<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.660> because<00:04:50.810> i

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
I'm going to try to add it because i

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.030 
I'm going to try to add it because i
only<00:04:51.290> have<00:04:51.500> six<00:04:51.770> minutes<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:52.340> my<00:04:52.550> memory<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.620> I

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
only have six minutes on my memory and I

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.560 
only have six minutes on my memory and I
just<00:04:55.280> grabbed<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.850> tweezers<00:04:56.090> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
just grabbed it with the tweezers and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.790 
just grabbed it with the tweezers and
again<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.500> looked<00:04:57.770> down<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:59.690> that's<00:05:00.590> how<00:05:00.770> I

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.710 
again I looked down and I that's how I
know<00:05:00.950> what<00:05:01.340> where<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.670> middle<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.570> I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
know what where the middle is and I

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.110 
know what where the middle is and I
always<00:05:08.810> add<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:10.130> first<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:12.010> then<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.220> always

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
always add this first and then I always

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:28.050 
always add this first and then I always
feel<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.600> inner<00:05:15.020> corner<00:05:15.560> for<00:05:15.800> last

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.920
