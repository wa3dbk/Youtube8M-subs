00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
well I can't define it as a competitive

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.320 
well I can't define it as a competitive
battle<00:02:03.189> because<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.670> know<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.909> doesn't<00:02:04.060> I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
battle because you know it doesn't I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.480 
battle because you know it doesn't I
mean<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.049> was<00:02:05.110> kind<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.439> random<00:02:05.770> fun<00:02:06.130> battle

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
mean it was kind of a random fun battle

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.509 
mean it was kind of a random fun battle
so<00:02:06.720> there<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.869> really<00:02:07.900> no<00:02:08.530> predictions

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
so there was really no predictions

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.789 
so there was really no predictions
really<00:02:09.939> there<00:02:10.119> was<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.269> couple<00:02:10.599> but<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.230> know

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
really there was a couple but you know

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.679 
really there was a couple but you know
it's<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.159> the<00:02:12.430> natural<00:02:12.760> switching<00:02:13.599> around

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
it's just the natural switching around

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.809 
it's just the natural switching around
because<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.439> type<00:02:14.650> disadvantages<00:02:15.400> but

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
because it will type disadvantages but

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.940 
because it will type disadvantages but
hey<00:02:16.510> that's<00:02:16.959> pretty<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:17.349> how<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:17.769> go

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
hey that's pretty much how they all go

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.250 
hey that's pretty much how they all go
anyway<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.459> there's<00:02:19.090> what's<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.599> difference

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
anyway so there's what's the difference

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.789 
anyway so there's what's the difference
what<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:22.090> anyways<00:02:22.480> I'm<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.169> gonna<00:02:23.379> go<00:02:23.769> for

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
what but anyways I'm just gonna go for

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.739 
what but anyways I'm just gonna go for
the<00:02:24.069> swords<00:02:24.459> dance<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:25.329> ditching<00:02:25.569> him<00:02:25.659> to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
the swords dance for ditching him to

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.270 
the swords dance for ditching him to
switch<00:02:26.019> out<00:02:26.409> into<00:02:26.859> something<00:02:27.219> else

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
switch out into something else

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.770 
switch out into something else
and<00:02:28.400> he<00:02:28.670> goes<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.940> krookodile<00:02:29.480> which

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and he goes to krookodile which

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890 
and he goes to krookodile which
intimidates<00:02:30.380> me<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.950> yeah<00:02:31.850> getting<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.630> plus

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
intimidates me so yeah getting up a plus

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.960 
intimidates me so yeah getting up a plus
two<00:02:33.170> swords<00:02:33.560> ends<00:02:33.740> will<00:02:33.920> help<00:02:34.100> rectify<00:02:34.520> that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
two swords ends will help rectify that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
two swords ends will help rectify that
problem<00:02:35.030> though<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.810> plus<00:02:36.740> now<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.130> plus

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
problem though and plus now I'm a plus

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000 
problem though and plus now I'm a plus
one<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.300> negated<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.020> drop<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.620> got

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
one because it negated the drop and got

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.730 
one because it negated the drop and got
one<00:02:40.370> extra<00:02:40.730> attack<00:02:41.060> boost<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.410> go<00:02:42.590> over<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
one extra attack boost so I go over the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.190 
one extra attack boost so I go over the
EQ<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.430> see<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.030> actually<00:02:44.390> saved<00:02:44.720> him<00:02:44.989> there

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
EQ and see that actually saved him there

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
EQ and see that actually saved him there
that<00:02:45.410> inhibited<00:02:45.920> actually<00:02:46.220> saved<00:02:46.550> him<00:02:46.850> there

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that inhibited actually saved him there

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.990 
that inhibited actually saved him there
so<00:02:47.690> he<00:02:47.930> revered<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.230> Dragon<00:02:48.650> Claw<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.850> he

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
so he revered the Dragon Claw and so he

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.280 
so he revered the Dragon Claw and so he
shows<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.450> off<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:50.989> actually<00:02:51.080> gonna

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
shows that off and I was actually gonna

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
shows that off and I was actually gonna
curious<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.830> why<00:02:52.040> he<00:02:52.069> stayed<00:02:52.550> in<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:53.150> mean<00:02:53.930> I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
curious as to why he stayed in I mean I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.330 
curious as to why he stayed in I mean I
thought<00:02:54.200> he<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.590> guess<00:02:54.890> he<00:02:55.010> didn't<00:02:55.190> have

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
thought he I guess he didn't have

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.280 
thought he I guess he didn't have
anything<00:02:55.700> else<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.060> switch<00:02:56.270> to<00:02:56.480> him<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:56.930> he

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
anything else to switch to him then he

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.680 
anything else to switch to him then he
had<00:02:57.620> Dragon<00:02:58.069> Claw<00:02:58.250> now<00:02:58.940> I'm<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.390> duel

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
had Dragon Claw now I'm this duel

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.090 
had Dragon Claw now I'm this duel
chopped<00:03:00.050> because<00:03:00.230> i<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.620> actually<00:03:00.769> putting

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
him to switch back to elect ross because

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.180 
him to switch back to elect ross because
electrons<00:03:04.519> has<00:03:04.790> levitate<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.750> i<00:03:06.290> wouldn't<00:03:06.980> be

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
electrons has levitate and i wouldn't be

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.400 
electrons has levitate and i wouldn't be
able<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.489> hit<00:03:07.700> him<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.480> that's<00:03:08.690> what<00:03:08.900> my<00:03:09.110> mind

process was at the time and he does go
back<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.620> electrons<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.459> time<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.030> with<00:03:14.390> eq

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
back to electrons this time so I with eq

back to electrons this time so I with eq
am<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.019> dang<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:16.190> friggin<00:03:16.580> brought<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.090> in

much how it works and since that freakin

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.069 
much how it works and since that freakin
electrons<00:03:40.670> has<00:03:40.820> levitate<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.690> only<00:03:41.930> way<00:03:42.019> you

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
electrons has levitate the only way you

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.789 
electrons has levitate the only way you
can<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:42.260> hit<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.799> is<00:03:42.950> if<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.310> use<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.579> move

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
can really hit it is if you use a move

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.229 
can really hit it is if you use a move
if<00:03:45.799> he<00:03:45.920> was<00:03:46.040> like<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.160> mold<00:03:46.489> breaker<00:03:46.670> Pokemon

if he was like a mold breaker Pokemon
and<00:03:47.540> then<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:47.900> uses<00:03:48.140> earthquake<00:03:48.739> but<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.640> know

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790

and then it uses earthquake but you know
that's<00:03:50.120> pretty<00:03:51.049> much<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.350> but<00:03:51.410> anyways<00:03:51.920> he

thing<00:04:40.820> I'm

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
thing I'm

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.780 
thing I'm
getting<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.170> Wi-Fi<00:04:42.560> booster<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:43.040> think<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.430> found

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
getting a Wi-Fi booster I think I found

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.970 
getting a Wi-Fi booster I think I found
one<00:04:44.060> online<00:04:44.240> for<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.900> linksys<00:04:45.440> wireless

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
one online for the linksys wireless

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.440 
one online for the linksys wireless
connection<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:48.130> my<00:04:49.130> alternate<00:04:49.700> solution<00:04:50.240> for

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
connection and my alternate solution for

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.260 
connection and my alternate solution for
now<00:04:50.480> would<00:04:50.990> be<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.170> move<00:04:51.500> out<00:04:52.160> of<00:04:52.220> my<00:04:52.670> room<00:04:52.730> and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
now would be to move out of my room and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.000 
now would be to move out of my room and
into<00:04:53.600> like<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> front<00:04:54.170> office<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.680> my<00:04:54.800> home

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
into like the front office of my home

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.360 
into like the front office of my home
and<00:04:55.430> then<00:04:56.300> pretty<00:04:56.600> much<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:57.130> battle<00:04:58.130> there

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
and then pretty much a battle there

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.520 
and then pretty much a battle there
because<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.760> Wi-Fi<00:04:58.940> seem<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.630> stay<00:05:00.260> at<00:05:00.320> its

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
because the Wi-Fi seem to stay at its

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.080 
because the Wi-Fi seem to stay at its
highest<00:05:00.980> peak<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.460> it<00:05:01.550> doesn't<00:05:01.910> seem<00:05:02.030> to

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
highest peak and it doesn't seem to

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.720 
highest peak and it doesn't seem to
disconnect<00:05:02.810> or<00:05:03.020> if<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.830> does<00:05:04.100> it's<00:05:04.370> probably

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
disconnect or if it does it's probably

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.910 
disconnect or if it does it's probably
just<00:05:04.910> nintendo<00:05:05.540> Wi-Fi<00:05:05.720> being<00:05:06.260> a<00:05:06.410> dick<00:05:06.710> or

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
just nintendo Wi-Fi being a dick or

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.940 
just nintendo Wi-Fi being a dick or
anything<00:05:07.040> stuff<00:05:07.730> but<00:05:08.170> yeah<00:05:09.170> that's<00:05:09.620> pretty

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
anything stuff but yeah that's pretty

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.670 
anything stuff but yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:10.070> my<00:05:10.460> plan<00:05:10.760> there<00:05:11.090> now<00:05:11.690> as<00:05:11.840> far<00:05:12.080> as<00:05:12.140> like<00:05:12.440> if

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
much my plan there now as far as like if

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.150 
much my plan there now as far as like if
i'm<00:05:13.100> going<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.610> like<00:05:13.790> streams<00:05:14.480> i'm<00:05:15.470> probably

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
i'm going to like streams i'm probably

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.540 
i'm going to like streams i'm probably
not<00:05:16.940> sure<00:05:17.510> what<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.810> do<00:05:17.960> about<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.550> because

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
not sure what to do about that because

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.460 
not sure what to do about that because
you<00:05:19.910> know<00:05:19.940> some<00:05:20.240> people<00:05:20.600> chat<00:05:21.050> while<00:05:21.290> they're
