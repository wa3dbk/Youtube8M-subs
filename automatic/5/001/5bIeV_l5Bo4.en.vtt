00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
really cheap and full of flavor but you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.310 
really cheap and full of flavor but you
have<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.030> cook<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.360> right<00:00:35.480> because<00:00:35.750> if<00:00:36.050> you

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
have to cook it right because if you

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.500 
have to cook it right because if you
cook<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.649> too<00:00:37.399> much<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:38.030> cut<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.360> wrong

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
cook it too much and you cut it wrong

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
it's getting really tough and chewy so

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.060 
it's getting really tough and chewy so
as<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.000> few<00:00:41.270> things<00:00:41.420> need<00:00:41.630> to<00:00:41.690> follow<00:00:41.950> that<00:00:42.950> if

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
as a few things need to follow that if

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.710 
as a few things need to follow that if
you<00:00:43.160> can<00:00:43.310> see<00:00:43.490> but<00:00:43.700> there's<00:00:43.880> a<00:00:44.000> grain<00:00:44.450> running

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
you can see but there's a grain running

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.390 
you can see but there's a grain running
through<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.080> meat<00:00:45.260> very<00:00:45.740> important<00:00:46.250> that

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
through the meat very important that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.650 
through the meat very important that
when<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.610> cut<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.970> that<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.120> shorten<00:00:47.570> the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
when you cut it that you shorten the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.630 
when you cut it that you shorten the

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
grain this is basically shortening the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.400 
grain this is basically shortening the
protein<00:00:50.000> strands<00:00:50.300> which<00:00:50.780> make<00:00:50.990> it<00:00:51.020> much<00:00:51.260> more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
protein strands which make it much more

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.560 
protein strands which make it much more
