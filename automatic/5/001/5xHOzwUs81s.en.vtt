00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
pictures look like this is from JPL and
you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> calibration<00:01:07.920> tool<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.610> oh

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you can see the calibration tool here oh

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
you can see the calibration tool here oh
man<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> looked<00:01:09.540> much<00:01:09.659> cleaner<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.439> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
right there it's the moly calibration

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.359 
right there it's the moly calibration
target<00:01:18.890> alright<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.009> let<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> little

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it's helping to bring some new people in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
it's helping to bring some new people in
the<00:01:31.290> channel<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> anomaly

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the channel to see some of the anomaly

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
the channel to see some of the anomaly
videos<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.630> said<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:33.960> go

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
videos and like I said here we go

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.190 
videos and like I said here we go
Miley<00:01:34.920> camera<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> mal<00:01:36.030> chili<00:01:36.450> calibration

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
Miley camera the mal chili calibration

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
Miley camera the mal chili calibration
target<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> ultraviolet<00:01:38.400> light<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
target and ultraviolet light now this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.929 
target and ultraviolet light now this
was<00:01:39.810> press<00:01:40.380> release<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
was press release was from I think it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
best pictures have been from this as

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.699 
best pictures have been from this as
it's<00:02:29.550> come<00:02:29.790> from<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> actual<00:02:30.420> rover<00:02:30.870> there's

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
it's come from the actual rover there's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.199 
it's come from the actual rover there's
a<00:02:31.769> couple<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.310> were<00:02:32.430> kind<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.760> skewed

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
a couple that were kind of skewed

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.610 
a couple that were kind of skewed
because<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.810> head<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> thing<00:02:34.470> was

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
because the head of the thing was

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.170 
because the head of the thing was
pointed<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.099> way<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.910> some

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
pointed this way and we got some

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270 
pointed this way and we got some
pictures<00:02:36.360> from<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.080> horizon<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.739> was

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
pictures from it of the horizon I was

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
pictures from it of the horizon I was
very<00:02:38.640> impressed<00:02:38.879> with<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.660> makes

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
very impressed with it and this makes

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 
very impressed with it and this makes
sense<00:02:39.959> now<00:02:40.319> why<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.739> looks<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.160> good<00:02:41.459> when<00:02:41.640> you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
sense now why it looks so good when you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
sense now why it looks so good when you
when<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> turn<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.629> around<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.110> looked

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
when you turn it around so it looked

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.670 
when you turn it around so it looked
good<00:02:43.819> see<00:02:44.819> here<00:02:45.120> curiosity<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> rover<00:02:46.500> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
engineering canvas that's why a lot of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.619 
engineering canvas that's why a lot of
that<00:02:54.690> stuff<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.050> don't<00:02:55.200> get<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> good<00:02:55.709> stuff

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
that stuff we don't get the good stuff

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.509 
that stuff we don't get the good stuff
let's<00:02:57.629> see<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.110> basically<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.159> is<00:02:59.310> more

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
let's see here basically this is more

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.070 
let's see here basically this is more
and<00:02:59.610> more<00:02:59.670> alright<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> penny<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and more alright the penny is on the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.199 
and more alright the penny is on the
Molly<00:03:01.260> calibration<00:03:01.920> target<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> tip<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
hat to geologists in formal practice or

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.080 
hat to geologists in formal practice or

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
informal practice of placing a coin or

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.030 
informal practice of placing a coin or
other<00:03:09.269> object<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.110> known<00:03:10.290> scale<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.950> their

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
other object of a known scale and their

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.130 
other object of a known scale and their
photographs<00:03:11.550> that's<00:03:12.090> also<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> scale<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.050> we

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
photographs that's also a scale so we

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.809 
photographs that's also a scale so we
know<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.500> there<00:03:13.739> we<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.069> how<00:03:14.190> big<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
know it's there we know how big it is a

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.000 
know it's there we know how big it is a
more<00:03:15.300> formal<00:03:15.510> practice<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.349> use<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.830> object

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
more formal practice is use an object

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.770 
more formal practice is use an object
with<00:03:17.340> scale<00:03:17.670> marked<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.239> millimeters

with scale marked in millimeters

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.290 
with scale marked in millimeters
centimeters<00:03:19.050> or<00:03:19.560> meters<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.790> says<00:03:21.030> of

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
centimeters or meters and it says of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.869 
centimeters or meters and it says of
course<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.530> penny<00:03:22.769> can't<00:03:23.099> be<00:03:23.280> moved<00:03:23.519> around

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
course this penny can't be moved around
