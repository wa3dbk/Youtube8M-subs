with<00:04:20.880> swivels<00:04:21.449> is<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.810> sometimes<00:04:22.139> you

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
with swivels is like sometimes you

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.110 
with swivels is like sometimes you
listen<00:04:22.470> for<00:04:22.590> drop<00:04:22.800> shock<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.340> when<00:04:23.789> your<00:04:23.910> drop

the<00:04:25.740> water<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.220> extremely<00:04:26.820> clear<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.630> having

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
a big ball bearing swivel is not the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.430 
a big ball bearing swivel is not the
best<00:04:30.000> idea<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.510> one<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.840> made<00:04:31.320> out

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
best idea so this one is made out

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.689 
best idea so this one is made out
fluorocarbon<00:04:31.740> tuna<00:04:32.070> so<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.340> would<00:04:32.430> be<00:04:32.490> nice

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
fluorocarbon tuna so it would be nice

and<00:04:32.880> clear<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.210> water<00:04:33.389> so<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.380> get<00:04:34.440> a

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
and clear in the water so you can get a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.050 
and clear in the water so you can get a
closer<00:04:34.770> look<00:04:35.010> at<00:04:35.130> those<00:04:35.340> hopefully<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:35.970> can

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
closer look at those hopefully you can

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.750 
closer look at those hopefully you can
see<00:04:36.270> both<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.600> them<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.470> those<00:04:38.160> go<00:04:38.310> for<00:04:38.340> five
