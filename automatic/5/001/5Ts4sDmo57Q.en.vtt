00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
the one you're going to use first mm-hmm

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.470 
the one you're going to use first mm-hmm
the<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:12.070> farthest<00:02:12.580> from<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:12.910> hand<00:02:13.120> up<00:02:13.300> at<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the one farthest from my hand up at the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.850 
the one farthest from my hand up at the
top<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.290> gonna<00:02:14.440> actually

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
top is the one that's gonna actually

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.450 
top is the one that's gonna actually
fold<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.250> Halfmoon<00:02:15.760> over<00:02:16.300> okay<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.710> put

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
fold that Halfmoon over okay so you put

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.570 
fold that Halfmoon over okay so you put
your<00:02:18.490> crimp<00:02:18.940> tube<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:20.340> bringing<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
your crimp tube in there bringing that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.560 
your crimp tube in there bringing that
down<00:02:22.170> firmly<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.910> we're<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.300> turn

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
down firmly and then we're going to turn

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.810 
down firmly and then we're going to turn
that<00:02:26.250> sideways<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.640> our<00:02:28.060> Halfmoon<00:02:29.820> is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
that sideways so that our Halfmoon is

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.280 
that sideways so that our Halfmoon is
facing<00:02:31.330> up<00:02:31.540> or<00:02:31.900> down<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.510> bring<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:35.050> around

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
facing up or down and bring that around

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.040 
facing up or down and bring that around
again<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.240> see<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.690> gives<00:02:37.930> a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
again and you can see that that gives a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.680 
again and you can see that that gives a
nice<00:02:38.230> rounded<00:02:38.830> shape<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.670> very<00:02:39.700> finished

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
nice rounded shape to it a very finished

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.600 
nice rounded shape to it a very finished
look<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.170> also<00:02:41.320> very<00:02:41.620> very<00:02:41.800> secure<00:02:42.220> okay

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
look and it's also very very secure okay

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.670 
look and it's also very very secure okay
now<00:02:43.300> most<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> time<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.960> recommend<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.580> we

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
now most of the time I recommend that we

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
now most of the time I recommend that we
slide<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.710> bead<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:48.610> two<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.300> cover<00:02:49.480> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
slide a bead on or two to cover that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
slide a bead on or two to cover that
little<00:02:50.050> piece<00:02:50.290> that's<00:02:50.500> hanging<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:51.010> there<00:02:51.190> in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
little piece that's hanging on there in

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.900 
little piece that's hanging on there in
this<00:02:51.700> case<00:02:51.940> we're<00:02:52.150> using<00:02:53.400> coral<00:02:54.400> beads<00:02:54.610> and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
this case we're using coral beads and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.790 
this case we're using coral beads and
pearl<00:02:55.630> beads<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.050> these<00:02:56.170> are<00:02:56.350> all<00:02:56.470> hand

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
pearl beads and these are all hand

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.550 
pearl beads and these are all hand
drilled<00:02:57.610> they're<00:02:58.390> very<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:58.959> small<00:02:59.230> holes

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
drilled they're very very small holes

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
drilled they're very very small holes
and<00:02:59.830> we're<00:03:00.280> not<00:03:00.400> gonna<00:03:00.580> be<00:03:00.670> able<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.910> get<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
and we're not gonna be able to get this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.270 
and we're not gonna be able to get this
through<00:03:01.570> there<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:02.320> could<00:03:02.590> go<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.920> lighter

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
through there we could go with a lighter

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.170 
through there we could go with a lighter
cable<00:03:04.000> strand<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> bracelet<00:03:06.400> really<00:03:06.880> needs

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
cable strand but a bracelet really needs

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.670 
cable strand but a bracelet really needs
to<00:03:07.270> have<00:03:07.420> some<00:03:07.600> strength<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.590> if

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
to have some strength to it so that if

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.170 
to have some strength to it so that if
you<00:03:08.770> catch<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.310> something<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:09.820> not<00:03:10.000> going

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
you catch it on something it's not going

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.690 
you catch it on something it's not going
to<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.420> break<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.459> case

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
to just break on you so in this case

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.840 
to just break on you so in this case
we're<00:03:13.300> going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.690> take<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.260> wire<00:03:15.190> cutters<00:03:15.520> and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
we're going to take the wire cutters and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.800 
we're going to take the wire cutters and
just<00:03:16.600> trim<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.959> flush<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.480> crimp

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
just trim that flush to the the crimp

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.530 
just trim that flush to the the crimp
bead<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:26.140> we're<00:03:26.380> going<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:27.540> start

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
bead I see and then we're going to start

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.420 
bead I see and then we're going to start
stringing<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:30.269> any<00:03:31.269> pattern<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.400> might

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
stringing in any pattern that you might

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.070 
stringing in any pattern that you might
choose

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.320 

I<00:03:37.670> really<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:38.850> these<00:03:40.820> coral<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:41.970> pearls

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
I really like these coral and pearls

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.620 
I really like these coral and pearls
together<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.710> elegant<00:03:44.340> yet<00:03:44.640> casual<00:03:45.330> I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
together it's it's elegant yet casual I

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.170 
together it's it's elegant yet casual I
think<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.230> very<00:03:46.350> pretty<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.610> at<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.880> point

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
think it's very pretty so at this point

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.670 
think it's very pretty so at this point
you<00:03:48.270> would<00:03:48.330> just<00:03:48.480> design<00:03:48.810> however<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.350> wanted

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you would just design however you wanted

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.100 
you would just design however you wanted
to<00:03:49.860> have<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.310> beads<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:51.030> there<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.480> what<00:03:51.990> I've

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
to have the beads on there and what I've

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.940 
to have the beads on there and what I've
got<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:53.430> here<00:03:54.060> that's<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> finished

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
got is one here that's to the finished

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.580 
got is one here that's to the finished
length<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.960> for<00:03:58.110> your<00:03:58.260> bracelet

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
length that you want for your bracelet

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.130 
length that you want for your bracelet
and<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:03:59.880> going<00:04:00.240> to<00:04:00.300> show<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.720> how<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.930> other

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
and I'm going to show you how the other

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.560 
and I'm going to show you how the other

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
end is attached okay

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.090 
end is attached okay
so<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.630> bring<00:04:04.020> on<00:04:04.230> your<00:04:04.580> crimp<00:04:05.580> tube<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:07.100> then

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
so you bring on your crimp tube and then

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.670 
so you bring on your crimp tube and then
we're<00:04:08.190> gonna<00:04:08.280> slide<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.270> other<00:04:10.140> end<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.590> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
we're gonna slide the other end of the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.980 
we're gonna slide the other end of the
toggle<00:04:10.890> clasp<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.640> there<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.660> can<00:04:12.810> see

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
toggle clasp on there and you can see

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.720 
toggle clasp on there and you can see
why<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.200> recommend<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.490> little

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
why I recommend that we have a little

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.400 
why I recommend that we have a little
extra<00:04:14.910> length<00:04:15.360> because<00:04:15.660> if<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.930> were<00:04:16.049> working

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
extra length because if you were working

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.720 
extra length because if you were working
with<00:04:16.440> something<00:04:16.739> very<00:04:17.040> very<00:04:17.190> short<00:04:17.519> it'd<00:04:17.640> be

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
with something very very short it'd be

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.539 
with something very very short it'd be
very<00:04:17.940> frustrating<00:04:18.690> oh<00:04:18.930> yeah<00:04:19.170> go<00:04:19.859> back<00:04:20.100> through

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
very frustrating oh yeah go back through

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.780 
very frustrating oh yeah go back through
your<00:04:20.580> crimp<00:04:21.000> tube<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.420> in<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.690> case<00:04:22.790> since

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
your crimp tube and in this case since

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.310 
your crimp tube and in this case since
they<00:04:24.000> won't<00:04:24.300> fit<00:04:24.600> through<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> hole<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.290> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
they won't fit through the hole of the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.310 
they won't fit through the hole of the
bead<00:04:25.560> we're<00:04:25.890> going<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.130> go<00:04:26.480> outside<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:28.110> bead

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
bead we're going to go outside the bead

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.250 
bead we're going to go outside the bead
and<00:04:30.470> one<00:04:31.470> way<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.770> get<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.190> snugged<00:04:33.080> you<00:04:34.080> can

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
and one way to get this snugged you can

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.160 
and one way to get this snugged you can
do<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.530> with<00:04:34.650> your<00:04:34.860> fingers<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.900> works

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
do it with your fingers and that works

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.990 
do it with your fingers and that works
but<00:04:37.500> sometimes<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:38.220> little<00:04:38.490> wire<00:04:38.670> just

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
but sometimes this little wire just

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.670 
but sometimes this little wire just
doesn't<00:04:39.300> want<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.510> hold<00:04:39.720> together<00:04:39.900> very<00:04:40.440> well

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
doesn't want to hold together very well

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.000 
doesn't want to hold together very well
don't<00:04:41.070> he<00:04:41.220> doesn't<00:04:41.520> want<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.700> cooperate<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:43.010> if

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
don't he doesn't want to cooperate so if

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.630 
don't he doesn't want to cooperate so if
you<00:04:44.160> use<00:04:44.700> your<00:04:45.000> tool<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.980> this<00:04:46.980> just<00:04:47.190> takes<00:04:47.460> a

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
you use your tool and this just takes a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.250 
you use your tool and this just takes a
little<00:04:48.000> bit<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.210> practice<00:04:48.770> mm-hmm<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:51.510> you

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
little bit of practice mm-hmm and you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.020 
little bit of practice mm-hmm and you
can<00:04:52.440> see<00:04:52.710> how<00:04:52.980> I'm<00:04:53.130> bringing<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.760> wire

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
can see how I'm bringing that wire

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.540 
can see how I'm bringing that wire
through<00:04:54.600> there<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:55.830> it's<00:04:55.950> still<00:04:56.070> leaving<00:04:56.370> a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
through there but it's still leaving a

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.740 
through there but it's still leaving a
little<00:04:56.730> bit<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.060> gap<00:04:57.270> okay<00:04:59.300> then<00:05:00.300> we<00:05:00.450> go<00:05:00.570> back

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
little bit of a gap okay then we go back

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.159 
little bit of a gap okay then we go back
