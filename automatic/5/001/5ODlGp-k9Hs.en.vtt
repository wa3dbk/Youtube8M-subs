you're gonna fold it on a diagonal once

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.160 
you're gonna fold it on a diagonal once
you<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.000> triangle<00:01:39.510> shape<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:39.990> just

you have a triangle shape you're just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.930 
you have a triangle shape you're just
gonna<00:01:40.320> snip<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> corner<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
gonna snip off the corner because you

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.390 
gonna snip off the corner because you
don't<00:01:42.120> need<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.770> we're<00:01:43.770> gonna<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.250> by

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
don't need it we're gonna start by

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.610 
don't need it we're gonna start by
cutting<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.880> triangle<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.630> from<00:01:45.900> our<00:01:46.050> piece<00:01:46.290> so

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
cutting a triangle out from our piece so

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.320 
cutting a triangle out from our piece so
that<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:46.920> resembles<00:01:47.070> an<00:01:47.580> arrowhead

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
that it resembles an arrowhead

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.000 
that it resembles an arrowhead
then<00:01:48.690> we're<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:48.900> snip<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.410> tip<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
then we're gonna snip off the tip and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.980 
then we're gonna snip off the tip and
make<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.250> slits<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.970> either<00:01:51.210> side<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
make two slits on either side of the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.960 
make two slits on either side of the
arrow<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> we'll<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.369> cutting<00:01:56.700> two

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
arrow then we'll also be cutting two

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.210 
arrow then we'll also be cutting two
slits<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.810> inside<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> arrow<00:01:58.800> on

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
slits on the inside of the arrow on

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.620 
slits on the inside of the arrow on
either<00:01:59.460> side

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.990 

once<00:02:06.229> all<00:02:06.470> cuts<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:07.040> been<00:02:07.070> made<00:02:07.250> then<00:02:07.759> your

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
once all cuts have been made then your

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.870 
once all cuts have been made then your
snowflake<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.660> done

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.590
