00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.660 

the<00:00:18.900> first<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> our<00:00:19.380> pixelate<00:00:19.949> filters<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the first of our pixelate filters the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.150 
the first of our pixelate filters the
color<00:00:20.910> halftone<00:00:21.240> filter<00:00:21.980> simulates<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
color halftone filter simulates the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.599 
color halftone filter simulates the
effect<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.150> color<00:00:24.840> halftone<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.890> there's<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
effect of a color halftone so there's a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
effect of a color halftone so there's a
simulation<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> breakdown<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
simulation of the breakdown of the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
simulation of the breakdown of the
pixels<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.400> dots<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.150> cyan<00:00:30.630> magenta<00:00:30.900> yellow

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
pixels into dots of cyan magenta yellow

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.190 
pixels into dots of cyan magenta yellow
and<00:00:31.890> black<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and black that is and this is the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.510 
and black that is and this is the
important<00:00:34.649> point<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.399> about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
important point I want to make about

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
important point I want to make about
this<00:00:35.790> filter<00:00:36.260> assuming<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.860> convert

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
this filter assuming that you convert

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
this filter assuming that you convert
the<00:00:38.579> image<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> CMYK<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.280> that's<00:00:41.280> an

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the image to CMYK and that's an

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.920 
the image to CMYK and that's an
important<00:00:41.879> point<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.780> apply

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
important point because if you apply

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.869 
important point because if you apply
this<00:00:43.230> filter<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.190> an<00:00:44.309> RGB<00:00:45.059> image<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
this filter to an RGB image you get a

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
this filter to an RGB image you get a
halftone<00:00:47.879> pattern<00:00:48.360> made<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> dots<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
halftone pattern made up of dots that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
halftone pattern made up of dots that
are<00:00:49.829> red<00:00:50.100> green<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.610> blue<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.360> doesn't

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
are red green and blue and that doesn't

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.770 
are red green and blue and that doesn't
exist<00:00:52.309> I'm<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> move<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
exist I'm going to move over now to my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.560 
exist I'm going to move over now to my
starting<00:00:55.590> image<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.250> before<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> apply<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
starting image and before I apply the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450 
starting image and before I apply the
color<00:00:57.989> halftone<00:00:58.260> filter<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
color halftone filter I'm just going to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.619 
color halftone filter I'm just going to
brighten<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> little<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.449> because

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
brighten it a little bit because

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
brighten it a little bit because
applying<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> filter<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> gonna<00:01:02.039> make<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
applying this filter is gonna make it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
applying this filter is gonna make it
look<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.820> darker<00:01:03.239> I'll<00:01:03.989> convert<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
look a bit darker I'll convert it to a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.480 
look a bit darker I'll convert it to a
smart<00:01:05.280> object<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.830> let's<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
smart object and let's just see how this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
smart object and let's just see how this
will<00:01:08.790> look<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.330> apply<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> filter<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
will look if I apply the filter to the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
will look if I apply the filter to the
image<00:01:11.280> while<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> still<00:01:12.090> an<00:01:12.299> RGB<00:01:12.960> image<00:01:14.780> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
image while it's still an RGB image so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
image while it's still an RGB image so
here's<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> dialog<00:01:16.500> box<00:01:16.909> maximum<00:01:17.909> radius

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
here's the dialog box maximum radius

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
here's the dialog box maximum radius
that's<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> size<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> dot<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> these<00:01:20.040> are

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that's the size of the dot and these are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
that's the size of the dot and these are
the<00:01:20.490> angles<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.689> cyan<00:01:22.140> magenta<00:01:22.350> yellow

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the angles of the cyan magenta yellow

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.240 
the angles of the cyan magenta yellow
and<00:01:23.340> black<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> change<00:01:24.509> these<00:01:24.750> angles

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
and black you can change these angles

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
and black you can change these angles
sometimes<00:01:26.250> people<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> filter<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
sometimes people use this filter to just

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
sometimes people use this filter to just
have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> black<00:01:29.130> halftone<00:01:29.729> dot<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.240> an

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
have a black halftone dot as an

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
have a black halftone dot as an
alternative<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> halftone<00:01:32.790> filter

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
alternative to the halftone filter

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.859 
alternative to the halftone filter
that's<00:01:33.810> part<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.619> sketch<00:01:35.430> group<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's part of the sketch group and if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420 
that's part of the sketch group and if
you<00:01:37.020> were<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.130> all

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you were to do so you would have all

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.960 
you were to do so you would have all
four<00:01:38.759> channels<00:01:39.030> being<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> same<00:01:39.960> angle<00:01:40.970> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
four channels being the same angle so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.660 
four channels being the same angle so
when<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> apply<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.799> zoom<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.490> I'm

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
when I apply that and we zoom in I'm

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
when I apply that and we zoom in I'm
going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> double<00:01:45.149> click<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.509> zoom<00:01:46.229> tool<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
going to double click on my zoom tool to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
going to double click on my zoom tool to
go<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> 100%<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> dot

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
go to 100% you can see that the dot

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
go to 100% you can see that the dot
pattern<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.610> an

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pattern that we have there is not an

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.950 
pattern that we have there is not an
accurate<00:01:51.000> reflection<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:52.140> how<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.710> CMYK

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
accurate reflection of how a CMYK

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
accurate reflection of how a CMYK
halftone<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.170> look<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> now

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
halftone will look and I'm going to now

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.310 
halftone will look and I'm going to now
switch<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.820> two-up<00:01:59.820> vertical<00:02:00.719> arrangement

switch to a two-up vertical arrangement

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.929 
switch to a two-up vertical arrangement

the<00:02:17.670> filter<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.510> RGB<00:02:19.110> image<00:02:19.519> we<00:02:20.519> need<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the filter to an RGB image we need to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.850 
the filter to an RGB image we need to
come<00:02:21.000> back<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.360> our<00:02:21.900> RGB<00:02:22.500> image<00:02:24.110> let's<00:02:25.110> undo

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
come back to our RGB image let's undo

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
come back to our RGB image let's undo
what<00:02:26.129> we<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.459> did<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.620> convert<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:29.040> CMYK<00:02:29.549> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
what we just did and convert to CMYK and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
what we just did and convert to CMYK and
the<00:02:31.319> best<00:02:31.560> way<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.799> do<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.159> is<00:02:32.370> actually

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the best way to do that is actually

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.899 
the best way to do that is actually
using<00:02:33.319> convert<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.650> profile<00:02:35.190> rather<00:02:35.579> than

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
using convert to profile rather than

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.449 
using convert to profile rather than
image<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.569> mode<00:02:37.110> convert<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.769> profile<00:02:38.220> gives

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
image and mode convert to profile gives

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.920 
image and mode convert to profile gives
you<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.730> chance<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.120> changing<00:02:39.720> your

how<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.609> gonna<00:02:53.730> look

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
how it's gonna look

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.309 
how it's gonna look
according<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.690> what<00:02:55.139> rendering<00:02:55.829> intent<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.400> use

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
according to what rendering intent I use

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.330 
according to what rendering intent I use
generally<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.680> toss-up<00:02:58.920> between

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
generally it's a toss-up between

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.440 
generally it's a toss-up between
perceptual<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.540> relative<00:03:01.409> colorimetric

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
perceptual and relative colorimetric

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.059 
perceptual and relative colorimetric
when<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> choose<00:03:03.810> colorimetric<00:03:04.409> there<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
when I choose colorimetric there is a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.729 
when I choose colorimetric there is a
slight<00:03:05.549> shift<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.870> sure<00:03:07.079> one<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.530> better

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
slight shift I'm not sure one is better

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.920 
slight shift I'm not sure one is better
than<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.040> other<00:03:08.359> they're<00:03:09.359> just<00:03:09.569> slightly

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
than the other they're just slightly

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.349 
than the other they're just slightly
different<00:03:10.489> whichever<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.700> looks<00:03:11.909> best

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
different whichever one looks best

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.110 
different whichever one looks best
that's<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.109> one<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.470> use<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:14.790> going<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.000> go

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that's the one to use I'm going to go

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.460 
that's the one to use I'm going to go
with<00:03:15.269> perceptual<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
with perceptual I think so we now have a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.500 
with perceptual I think so we now have a
CMYK<00:03:20.069> image<00:03:21.199> tells<00:03:22.199> us<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.889> there

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
CMYK image tells us that right there

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.979 
CMYK image tells us that right there
let's<00:03:24.510> go<00:03:24.930> back<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.440> our<00:03:25.470> fit<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.129> window<00:03:26.519> view

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
let's go back to our fit in window view

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.479 
let's go back to our fit in window view
the<00:03:27.989> next<00:03:28.319> thing<00:03:28.470> I'd<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.799> do<00:03:29.069> before

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the next thing I'd like to do before

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.089 
the next thing I'd like to do before
applying<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.060> filter<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:31.199> open<00:03:31.799> up<00:03:31.889> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
applying the filter is just open up the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.640 
applying the filter is just open up the
shadows<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> bit<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:33.900> gonna<00:03:34.019> do<00:03:34.290> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
shadows a bit and I'm gonna do that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.610 
shadows a bit and I'm gonna do that
through<00:03:35.239> shadows<00:03:36.239> highlights<00:03:36.690> adjustment

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
through shadows highlights adjustment

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.520 
through shadows highlights adjustment
and<00:03:37.799> since<00:03:38.639> I've<00:03:38.790> converted<00:03:39.389> this<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.169> smart

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and since I've converted this to a smart

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.280 
and since I've converted this to a smart
object<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.819> do<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.150> non<00:03:42.599> destructively

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
object I can do that non destructively

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.349 
object I can do that non destructively
and<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.799> gonna<00:03:43.980> act<00:03:44.340> as<00:03:44.669> if<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.209> were<00:03:45.329> a

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
and it's gonna act as if it were a

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.900 
and it's gonna act as if it were a
filter<00:03:45.870> I'll<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.769> use<00:03:46.980> these<00:03:47.190> values<00:03:47.430> of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
filter I'll just use these values of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.550 
filter I'll just use these values of
opening<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.660> shadows<00:03:49.109> by<00:03:49.319> 35%<00:03:51.049> then<00:03:52.049> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
opening up the shadows by 35% then to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.009 
opening up the shadows by 35% then to
the<00:03:52.680> filter<00:03:52.980> menu<00:03:53.120> color<00:03:54.120> halftone<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.810> last

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
the filter menu color halftone the last

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.599 
the filter menu color halftone the last
one<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.379> used<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:55.829> going<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.040> use<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.370> same

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
one we used I'm going to use the same

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.159 
one we used I'm going to use the same
values<00:03:57.000> again<00:03:57.299> so<00:03:57.449> I'm<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.659> going<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.900> choose

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
values again so I'm just going to choose

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.220 
values again so I'm just going to choose
it<00:03:58.349> right<00:03:58.680> there

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
it right there

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.580 
it right there
and<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.489> now<00:04:02.730> look<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.510> 100%<00:04:04.349> view

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
and if we now look at that of 100% view

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.520 
and if we now look at that of 100% view
size<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:05.849> see<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.480> rosette<00:04:07.139> pattern

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
size and we see that rosette pattern

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.530 
size and we see that rosette pattern
which<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.919> far<00:04:08.220> more<00:04:08.250> accurate<00:04:08.549> simulation

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
