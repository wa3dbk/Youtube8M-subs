00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.850
 girls hello everyone today i want 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.029
 with you to do the styling using 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.239
 cone curling i'm finally and 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.329
 I got from a ruby something like that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 cone curling and I want to show you how 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.530
 I twist her hair and what is the result 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.820
 effect is obtained 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.880
 if you're interested, go ahead 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.280
 look and I'll start with the fact that a little bit 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.350
 I want to talk to you about this curling 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.170
 chose rowenta because we have 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.129
 stores honestly not a big choice 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.890
 that's it ration of such a plan it goes 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.020
 white this pottery is also here 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.299
 there is a control panel there is 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.330
 small screen where indicated 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.600
 temperature and also indicated included 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.190
 on or off key plus or minus 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.070
 to do 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.850
 the temperature is bigger and smaller 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.970
 Naturally the power button 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.060
 off the curler itself warms up from 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 I think up to 200 degrees I usually 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 I warm up the curling iron well , somewhere around 150 degrees 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.259
 160 of them went to this board 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 these are the interesting things they are 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.040
 put on the finger cheholchiki possible 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.900
 say but I think the best done 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.780
 the glove is usually a standard glove 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.210
 it would be much more convenient here two of them 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.950
 pieces on the right to the left hand if you 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.040
 only then you will also have the opportunity 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.890
 use them but I use them 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.170
 absolutely not convenient and I do not use them 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 only very smooth hair to her not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 stick it cools very quickly 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.130
 heats up very quickly told you 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.770
 a little bit a curling and now let's 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.159
 let's get down to it in application so for 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.540
 start i comb my hair 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:14.689
 they are pure to me only today we 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.269
 los when i do styling whether it is 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:20.599
 hair straightening whether this curling 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:25.640
 hair is always hair divided by several 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:28.760
 parts in today's hair styling and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.970
 will be divided into three parts lower middle 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.000
 and the top is more accurate hair that us 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.730
 she doesn't need them now 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.980
 so that they do not interfere with the divide into two 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 strands once again comb only mine 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.349
 I will warm up I will not take strands 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.769
 small and not very large such 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:59.439
 mediocre and in this way 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.269
 spin hair 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.099
 hold curling in this position because 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.169
 so much more convenient to fix 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.159
 hair in just a few seconds 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:14.599
 I clean here such curls turn out 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.569
 I'm already the second time I will 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.010
 use this curler and i already have 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.609
 there was some such 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.079
 they are first impressions i don't me first 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.239
 it was not very comfortable to turn 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.180
 I have her hair but then I got it 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.199
 I realized that the most convenient to keep curling 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.840
 exactly in this position 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:41.329
 just a couple of seconds is also important 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.810
 that the tip goes plastic he's not 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.280
 heats up and conveniently remove hair 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.280
 also wind them up 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.859
 now I will do the same with the other 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.859
 parties 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.920
 see what 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.920
 springy curls are obtained 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:26.370
 but from this side too curls are ready 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:31.630
 back again to our hair and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.120
 I divide into two more halves and now 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.600
 in the same way strand by strand we wind 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.600
 hair 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.690
 slimes already turns curls bye 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.210
 that leaving them in this form with nothing 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.520
 I do not do them and continue to turn everything 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:01.480
 the rest of the hair so well and now I will 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.630
 twist the last part of the hair comb 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.050
 I have them and here is the rest of my hair 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.930
 connected together with a long bangs bangs 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.840
 I twist this way I will not 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.000
 stack it a little different therefore 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.980
 separate hair from bangs 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.030
 left quite a bit fu when on 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.130
 the street is very hot better than this styling 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.000
 do not engage or have under 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:34.030
 air conditioning because i am very hot and 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.880
 occupation is not fast 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.250
 spend a lot of time to 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.950
 screw the whole head especially if u 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.340
 your hair is long if your hair is shorter 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.950
 then it will be easier and faster last 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.400
 part of the hair i always twist this way 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.330
 his comb-over I have them forward to face Peru 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.280
 hide and seek 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:05.070
 take a small curling as usual 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:05.070
 curl hair hold a couple of seconds 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:19.320
 and tidy up here and so strand back and so 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:23.700
 I will do with all the hair now 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.880
 I will bang and and divide into 2 parts and 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.400
 then I will do a bang on one side and fill 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.550
 I do the same thing on the face of another 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.530
 hand but here's the principle all hair is all 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.590
 screwed you can leave them so 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.370
 way but I prefer to curls 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.300
 We have a little time I do combed 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.520
 it's using your fingers like this then 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.280
 I think the hair is more 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:07:00.060
 spectacular still love to tilt hair 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:03.780
 down about the trumpet that's all you see 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.520
 the result is bombed I if 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.800
 I honestly look at myself and I think I 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.000
 like a redhead girl from a cartoon 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.600
 brave Heart 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.640
 because curls turn out fine 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.130
 it turns out a lot of them and if here's another 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.530
 comb their comb no fingers like me 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.750
 it made a comb then it turns out 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.420
 In general, this way and the pilot seems to me 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.260
 on my head but i'm happy because 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.990
 sometimes I want to have this 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.360
 the effect is what i can recommend this 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.450
 cheating if you see in your shop 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.370
 you know that she's not bad to see 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.470
 the only thing you need to get the hang of it 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.420
 a little bit to use it 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:47.310
 Well, the hair is obtained and I like it 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.470
