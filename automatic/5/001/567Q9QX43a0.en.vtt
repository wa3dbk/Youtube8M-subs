you to do this when you use this set um
that's<00:01:32.549> totally<00:01:32.880> fine<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.540> speed<00:01:33.960> really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that's totally fine this speed really

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
that's totally fine this speed really
doesn't<00:01:34.619> matter<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> speed

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
doesn't matter you can take that speed

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
doesn't matter you can take that speed
out<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.960> could<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.530> attack<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
out you could put it in attack which I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
out you could put it in attack which I
would<00:01:39.090> probably<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
would probably do because that's just

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.450 
would probably do because that's just
gonna<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.770> brave<00:01:40.920> bird<00:01:41.130> hit<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> little
