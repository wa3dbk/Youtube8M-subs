00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.860
 Brussels 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.859
 it's an organized city 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.130
 and its cathedral is heavily visited 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.550
 its architecture blends with modern designs 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.980

 But she leaves my city. 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.790
 all my memories are here 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.720
 in this school 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.240
 It was my first kiss. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 The first time I go out 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.220
 it's still worse 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 I spent a lot of time with my horse 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.490
 when I was not at school 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310
 my horse 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 trying 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 in competitions during the course 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.900

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 and holidays 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.920
 and also played 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 my friends 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.420
 there it is very important to have a contact with animals when you are 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.349
 small 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.349
 it's very intuitive 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.019
 communicative 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.389

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.869
 patients

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.180
 with the intention of enriching dora on the same day 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.999
 however we should do more 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.999
 many very strange comparisons 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.919

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.799

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.839
 state to direction 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.129
 You can test driving. 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.129

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.199
 for animals 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.669
 I remember when I was little I was afraid 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.189
 fear of speed 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.649
 tall 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.619
 I did not have the courage to do anything. 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.279
 Then when you're a teenager. 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.629

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.369
 with the contact with nature and animals 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.219
 balance for a profession the technique 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.769
 precision 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.639

 the little dry weather 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.559
 but that's what happens 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.509
 It's important to be part of the day. 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.300
 if the viewer 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.040
