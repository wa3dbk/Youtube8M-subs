00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I think everyone can express their opinion 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 except 'progressive' left-wing students. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 They should be spared a platform as part of their training, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 so that they also feel what that is like. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 This is called equality and honesty. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Can it be even more "progressive"? 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I say this because it seems like we hear about it every week 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 someone who is banned or knocked down in one of those 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 "progressive" bubbles full of justified intolerance 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 which we still dare to call universities. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 In fact, a recent report has shown that freedom of expression no longer exists 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 in four of the five British universities 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 because 'progressive' students are too intellectually delicate 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 for ideas that don't make them comfortable 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 by attacking their prejudices and hurting their feelings. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 So they demand, and get, what they call 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 the right to be comfortable, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 the right to a safe place for all students, 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 which means the right to never prejudice their half-baked prejudices 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 be contradicted, and the right to be pampered 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 like little princes and princesses, in a cocoon of home-made 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 'progressive' performances. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 This right to be comfortable is of course 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 very selective, and only extends that far 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 to those who share the same opinion. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Everyone else can expect not to be comfortable at all 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 because she is being silenced - or simply banned, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 or knocked down by militant "progressive" bias 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 they think in slogans, and they think it's more heroic 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 to be "progressive" than to be accurate or morally correct, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 or to have something that looks like an open mind. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It is bad enough that this is happening in our society at all 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 in the 21st century, but on top of that it happens at universities, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 where our society is made, 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 and that makes it many times more dangerous and damaging. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And yet the authorities just let it happen 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 for reasons that know their 'common goal' (whatever that may mean) best 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 and they don't do their job. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Even someone like me knows the main purpose of one 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 education is to teach people to develop 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 with a curious mind, to introduce them to new ideas 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 and information, and make them think for themselves. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 If it doesn't, it's not education, 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 no matter how many letters you have after your name. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It is then just a kind of valet parking of the memory. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And that is what apparently counts as education today, 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 not only in England, but throughout the western world, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 because today, apart from religion, a university is the only place where 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 you find people with unthinking, strange ideas, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 deaf to reason and blind to proof, 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 and they appear to be hypnotized to the point where they seriously believe 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 that the rights and freedoms of others are secondary to their feelings. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 What does it say about someone's character? 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 as the only way he or she can be comfortable 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 can be undermined by the rights of others? 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Not that it matters, because they don't listen anyway. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 They have not learned to listen or think, 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 just to absorb and agree to "progressive" propaganda, 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 and playing, censoring, and suppressing justice 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 from anyone who does not agree. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Not at all curious and totally sure 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 in a way that only makes real stupid people. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Certainly enough to want to have control over everyone's opinions 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 but lying enough to call it a safe place 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 for all students. Yeah, right ... 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Except those with whom you disagree, don't you, "progressives"? 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 There is no safe place for students to express opinions that you do not like, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 for example for a democratic Europe, 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 or express an opinion before Israel (and yes, there is certainly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 but you don't know them again). 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And there is no safe place for students who have other arguments 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 want to hear different opinions. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 You know, good students who are there for the right reason, 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 to deal with other people's ideas so that they can expand their knowledge, 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 to evaluate arguments and to think for themselves. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 There is no safe place for those people, 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 and your intolerant militants are the reason why. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Are you afraid to hear the arguments 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 in case you are convinced and have to change your mind? 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It is not as bad as it sounds, I can assure you. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 But if you are not even open to the possibility 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 (and if you knock people down you certainly don't) 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 then you will not be properly trained. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 You are brainwashed and lied to 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 just like a devout religious. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 You are even too arrogant to see that 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 every time you let someone shut up you harm yourself. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 You show your measles and your fear, 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 and you generate disapproval of yourself as an individual 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 that you will carry forever as a mark on your character 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 for the rest of your life, because when you finally grow up 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 in ten, twenty or thirty years 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 and decide that you want to renounce this horrible behavior, 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 don't you like that? The crime is too big. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 The betrayal too fundamental. 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 We can now see exactly who you are 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 and how low you are willing to sink. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And we can see that from your sheltered and privileged position 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 of closed spirits you voluntarily 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 the rights of everyone, 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 whose importance you do not seem to understand 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 because you learned that. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 You are undermining the foundations of our society, 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 the principle that gives us all freedom 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 to be who we are, and that gives you freedom 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 to exploit that freedom and the intolerant 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 to be the intellectual and moral murmur that you are. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The joke is that you claim to act from a moral point of view. 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 In reality you are on the same moral level as war collaborators. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 You do real harm to people, and you will not be forgiven. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 In the places where tomorrow's enlightened leadership 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 should arise, are you just like pesticides. 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 You bring shame on universities 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 who pollute you with your presence, and whose soil 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 occupy you with false pretensions. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And that applies to students, teachers, 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 administrators or professors. If you contribute to this, 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 this facilitates or actively participates in the suppression of 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 free views on a campus of a university, 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 are you a cheater, and are you the problem.
