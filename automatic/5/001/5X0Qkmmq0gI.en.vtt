well<00:00:01.439> it's<00:00:01.620> been<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.829> while<00:00:02.040> since<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.370> time<00:00:02.550> of

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
well it's been a while since the time of

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.460 
well it's been a while since the time of
videos<00:00:02.970> I've<00:00:03.270> had<00:00:03.419> many<00:00:03.659> other<00:00:03.780> things<00:00:04.049> there

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
videos I've had many other things there

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.769 
videos I've had many other things there
so<00:00:04.980> now<00:00:05.130> I've<00:00:05.220> got<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.490> Ltd<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.480> strip

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
so now I've got this Ltd here to strip

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.220 
so now I've got this Ltd here to strip
the<00:00:07.589> things<00:00:07.830> ruined<00:00:08.780> don't<00:00:09.780> ask<00:00:09.929> me<00:00:10.139> about

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the things ruined don't ask me about

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.759 
the things ruined don't ask me about
that

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
that

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.609 
that
and<00:00:11.840> behind<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:14.809> an<00:00:15.809> essence

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.230 

well<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.890> mission<00:00:20.310> seems<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> few

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
well this mission seems to have a few

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
well this mission seems to have a few
problems<00:00:21.619> like<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> stardom<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.460> routed

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
problems like the stardom that is routed

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
problems like the stardom that is routed
the<00:00:24.210> fuel<00:00:24.449> pump<00:00:24.689> relay<00:00:24.840> stuff<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.710> fuel<00:00:25.920> pump

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the fuel pump relay stuff and fuel pump

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
the fuel pump relay stuff and fuel pump
itself<00:00:26.430> stopped<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> doesn't<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.410> go

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
itself stopped so it doesn't really go

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.459 
itself stopped so it doesn't really go
anywhere<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.990> cut<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.980> off<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> battery

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
anywhere and I cut this off the battery

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.040 
anywhere and I cut this off the battery
it<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.710> completely<00:00:35.190> pointless<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.989> had<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it was completely pointless I had a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
it was completely pointless I had a
negative<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> battery<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.820> positive

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
negative going of the battery a positive

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
negative going of the battery a positive
gearing<00:00:39.570> his<00:00:39.719> battery<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:41.010> went<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
gearing his battery which went to this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.560 
gearing his battery which went to this
relay<00:00:43.070> which<00:00:44.070> went<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.300> wires

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
relay which went to these two wires

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.060 
relay which went to these two wires
which<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:46.020> take<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.410> yellow<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:46.890> go

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
which would take two yellow which go

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
which would take two yellow which go
back<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> relay<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.200> way<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.379> wired

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
back to the relay and the way it's wired

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
back to the relay and the way it's wired
up<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.520> energize<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.360> relay

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
up all it can do is energize the relay

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.790 
up all it can do is energize the relay
but<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> problem<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> way<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.110> wired<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but the problem is the way it's wired it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
but the problem is the way it's wired it
needs<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.309> energized<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> stay<00:00:57.180> energized

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
needs to be energized to stay energized

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
needs to be energized to stay energized
so<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.260> other<00:00:58.379> words<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.829> completely

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
so in other words it was completely

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.820 
so in other words it was completely
pointless<00:01:01.609> we<00:01:05.600> yeah<00:01:06.600> today's<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.290> job<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
pointless we yeah today's little job I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
pointless we yeah today's little job I
put<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> new<00:01:08.729> condenser<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.900> six

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
put a new condenser in this about six

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
put a new condenser in this about six
months<00:01:10.500> ago<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> old<00:01:11.610> series<00:01:11.970> one

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
months ago this is the old series one

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.200 
months ago this is the old series one
and<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.290> failed

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
and it's failed

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.980 
and it's failed
guess<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.390> brand<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.189> hmm<00:01:17.189> yes<00:01:18.150> off<00:01:19.070> so

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
guess what brand it is hmm yes off so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
guess what brand it is hmm yes off so
that<00:01:21.990> doesn't<00:01:22.200> surprise<00:01:22.439> me<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.820> I've

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that doesn't surprise me at all so I've

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
that doesn't surprise me at all so I've
got<00:01:24.119> an<00:01:24.240> American<00:01:24.540> brand<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.220> I'll

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
got an American brand one now and I'll

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
got an American brand one now and I'll
put<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.420> happens<00:01:30.170> these

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
put that in and see what happens these

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
put that in and see what happens these
parts<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.770> were<00:01:31.890> made<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> USA<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.780> for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
parts here were made in the USA and for

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
parts here were made in the USA and for
both<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> points<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:34.710> condenser<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.280> cost

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
both the points then condenser it cost

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.210 
both the points then condenser it cost
me<00:01:35.610> four<00:01:35.850> dollars<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.270> 80<00:01:36.420> cents<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
me four dollars an 80 cents so this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.870 
me four dollars an 80 cents so this
Bosch<00:01:38.490> condenser<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> cost<00:01:39.540> 10<00:01:39.810> dollars<00:01:40.880> we

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
Bosch condenser it cost 10 dollars we

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.350 
Bosch condenser it cost 10 dollars we
know<00:01:42.659> we'll<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.380> happens

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
know we'll see what happens

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.940 
know we'll see what happens
alright<00:01:46.360> there's<00:01:46.900> new<00:01:47.080> points<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.560> condenser

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
alright there's new points and condenser

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.830 
alright there's new points and condenser
installed<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:48.910> hopefully<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.330> don't<00:01:49.540> have<00:01:49.720> to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
installed so hopefully I don't have to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.500 
installed so hopefully I don't have to
do<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.140> again<00:01:50.440> within<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.860> six<00:01:51.070> months<00:01:51.510> it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
do this again within the six months it's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.510 
do this again within the six months it's
quite<00:01:52.720> annoying<00:01:55.500> well<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.530> can<00:01:56.860> answer<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.280> show

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
quite annoying well I can answer to show

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.250 
quite annoying well I can answer to show
of<00:01:57.670> fact<00:01:57.940> these<00:01:58.420> plants<00:01:58.810> were<00:01:58.900> pretty<00:01:59.110> much

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
of fact these plants were pretty much

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.710 
of fact these plants were pretty much
perfect<00:01:59.830> when<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.040> put<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.490> now<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:01.450> can<00:02:01.600> see

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
perfect when I put it in now you can see

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.480 
perfect when I put it in now you can see
that<00:02:01.840> all<00:02:01.960> black<00:02:02.230> is<00:02:02.440> burnt<00:02:02.770> around<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> edges

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
that all black is burnt around the edges

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.700 
that all black is burnt around the edges
and<00:02:04.530> lots<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.760> material<00:02:06.760> transfer<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
and lots of material transfer so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.230 
and lots of material transfer so
sparking<00:02:09.250> at<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.430> points<00:02:09.760> not<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.000> back

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
sparking at the points not this back

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.410 
sparking at the points not this back
legs<00:02:11.040> stupid<00:02:12.040> posh<00:02:12.250> condensers<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:13.000> happens

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
legs stupid posh condensers this happens

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.510 
legs stupid posh condensers this happens
way<00:02:13.630> too<00:02:13.660> often<00:02:16.500> no<00:02:17.500> let's<00:02:17.770> see<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> works

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
way too often no let's see if that works
