now obviously the Vita and PlayStation 4

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
now obviously the Vita and PlayStation 4
share<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> lot<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.820> similarities<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.630> only

share a lot of similarities and not only

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
share a lot of similarities and not only
in<00:01:33.990> terms<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> philosophy<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.979> design<00:01:35.189> but

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
in terms of philosophy of design but

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.010 
in terms of philosophy of design but
also<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.810> idea<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.560> terms<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.040> integration

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
also the idea of in terms of integration

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
also the idea of in terms of integration
both<00:01:40.020> systems<00:01:40.530> were<00:01:40.710> most<00:01:40.920> likely<00:01:41.220> being

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
both systems were most likely being

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
both systems were most likely being
developed<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> 2008<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> ps4<00:01:43.770> was

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
developed in 2008 we know the ps4 was

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.899 
developed in 2008 we know the ps4 was
being<00:01:44.220> developed<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.729> 2008<00:01:45.420> anyway<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:47.369> lot

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
being developed in 2008 anyway and a lot

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.960 
being developed in 2008 anyway and a lot
of<00:01:47.939> their<00:01:48.270> ideas<00:01:48.750> behind<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.740> Vita<00:01:49.970> certainly

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
of their ideas behind the Vita certainly

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.230 
of their ideas behind the Vita certainly
seeped<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.600> ps4<00:01:52.290> development<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:54.210> back

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
seeped into ps4 development now way back

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.160 
seeped into ps4 development now way back
in<00:01:54.720> 2009<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.430> knew<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.240> PlayStation<00:01:57.840> 4

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
in 2009 we knew that the PlayStation 4

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520 
in 2009 we knew that the PlayStation 4
was<00:01:58.560> good<00:01:58.619> sorry<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.570> PlayStation<00:02:01.079> Vita

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
was good sorry that the PlayStation Vita

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
was good sorry that the PlayStation Vita
was<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.549> powerful<00:02:02.759> system

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
was going to be a very powerful system

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
was going to be a very powerful system
indeed<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.649> already<00:02:04.799> news<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
indeed and there was already news that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.320 
indeed and there was already news that
it<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:06.000> were<00:02:06.060> speaking<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.960> various<00:02:07.110> arm

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
it they were speaking to various arm

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
it they were speaking to various arm
manufacturers<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.080> end<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.500> came<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
manufacturers in the end it came down to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.160 
manufacturers in the end it came down to
the<00:02:11.280> fact<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.879> was<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> leak<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the fact that there was a leak that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
the fact that there was a leak that
they<00:02:13.410> were<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.860> utilizing<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> power

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
they were actually utilizing the power

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.860 
they were actually utilizing the power
of<00:02:15.030> VR<00:02:15.420> SGX<00:02:16.130> five<00:02:17.130> four<00:02:17.610> three<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.239> there<00:02:18.780> was

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
of VR SGX five four three and there was

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.110 
of VR SGX five four three and there was
gonna<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.200> quad<00:02:19.770> core<00:02:20.130> configuration<00:02:20.970> which

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
gonna be a quad core configuration which

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.460 
gonna be a quad core configuration which
means<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.569> was<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> very<00:02:22.200> powerful

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
means it was gonna be a very powerful

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.870 
means it was gonna be a very powerful
system<00:02:23.069> indeed<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.750> means<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
system indeed now this means that the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.580 
system indeed now this means that the
final<00:02:26.880> configuration<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> Vita<00:02:28.080> turned

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the Vita as well I guess you could say

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.120 
the Vita as well I guess you could say
that<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> very<00:03:30.090> nature<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.230> very<00:03:31.410> idea<00:03:31.920> of

course Sony and mark Cerny himself

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.599 
course Sony and mark Cerny himself
continued<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.200> call<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.590> PlayStation<00:03:38.130> 4<00:03:38.160> I

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
continued to call the PlayStation 4 I

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.660 
continued to call the PlayStation 4 I
guess<00:03:39.359> you<00:03:39.450> could<00:03:39.630> say<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.590> really

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
guess you could say that they really

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.670 
guess you could say that they really
originated<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.390> first<00:03:42.630> got<00:03:42.810> our<00:03:42.989> hands<00:03:43.530> on

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
originated and we first got our hands on

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.420 
originated and we first got our hands on

them on the PlayStation Vita stock which
is<00:03:47.549> very<00:03:47.790> much<00:03:48.060> very<00:03:48.870> similar<00:03:49.320> design<00:03:49.500> but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
is very much very similar design but

I<00:04:05.130> remember<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> Vita<00:04:06.269> only<00:04:06.630> has<00:04:06.870> 128

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
I remember the Vita only has 128

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.550 
I remember the Vita only has 128
megabytes<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.700> video<00:04:08.880> RAM<00:04:09.299> that's<00:04:09.900> about<00:04:10.200> half

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
megabytes of video RAM that's about half

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.740 
megabytes of video RAM that's about half
of<00:04:10.829> what's<00:04:11.040> inside<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.639> PlayStation<00:04:12.209> 3<00:04:12.569> but

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
of what's inside the PlayStation 3 but

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.219 
of what's inside the PlayStation 3 but
also<00:04:13.170> remember<00:04:13.859> that<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:15.180> screen<00:04:15.569> size<00:04:15.930> which

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
also remember that the screen size which

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.379 
also remember that the screen size which
is<00:04:16.320> about<00:04:16.470> 5<00:04:16.829> inches<00:04:17.130> or<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.120> also

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
is about 5 inches or so is also

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.300 
is about 5 inches or so is also
considerably<00:04:19.019> smaller<00:04:19.530> meaning<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> can

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
considerably smaller meaning you can

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.039 
considerably smaller meaning you can
definitely<00:04:20.579> get<00:04:20.970> away<00:04:21.239> with<00:04:21.510> either<00:04:21.720> lower

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
definitely get away with either lower

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.050 
definitely get away with either lower
resolution<00:04:22.650> textures<00:04:23.070> lower<00:04:23.250> resolution<00:04:23.849> and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
resolution textures lower resolution and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.720 
resolution textures lower resolution and
generally<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.750> much<00:04:25.380> more<00:04:25.620> besides

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
generally and much more besides

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.520 
generally and much more besides
is<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.090> say<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.600> PlayStation<00:04:28.110> Vita<00:04:28.230> is<00:04:28.500> a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
is to say that the PlayStation Vita is a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.070 
is to say that the PlayStation Vita is a
very<00:04:28.800> powerful<00:04:29.040> device<00:04:29.490> for<00:04:30.120> its<00:04:30.240> time<00:04:30.480> sure

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
very powerful device for its time sure

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.180 
very powerful device for its time sure
you're<00:04:31.260> gonna<00:04:31.410> get<00:04:31.650> some<00:04:31.920> crisp

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
you're gonna get some crisp

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.520 
you're gonna get some crisp
cross-platform<00:04:33.090> titles<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.960> for<00:04:34.140> example

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
cross-platform titles that for example

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.780 
cross-platform titles that for example
are<00:04:34.590> going<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.860> running<00:04:35.040> at<00:04:35.220> 30<00:04:35.370> frames<00:04:35.700> a

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
are going to be running at 30 frames a

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.210 
are going to be running at 30 frames a
second<00:04:36.150> or<00:04:36.270> lower<00:04:36.990> levels<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.440> anti-aliasing

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
second or lower levels of anti-aliasing

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.250 
second or lower levels of anti-aliasing
on<00:04:38.370> whatever<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:39.300> it's<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.540> very<00:04:39.960> powerful

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
on whatever but it's a very powerful

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.680 
on whatever but it's a very powerful
device<00:04:40.620> for<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.670> period<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.090> time<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.510> was

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
device for the period of time that was

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.470 
device for the period of time that was
released<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:44.430> think<00:04:44.850> it's<00:04:45.270> gonna

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
released in and I think it's gonna

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.060 
released in and I think it's gonna
become<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.810> lot<00:04:46.140> more<00:04:46.170> essential<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:46.980> people

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
become a lot more essential for people

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.220 
become a lot more essential for people
because<00:04:47.430> there<00:04:47.910> was<00:04:48.000> somewhat<00:04:48.360> boycotted<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
because there was somewhat boycotted the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.010 
because there was somewhat boycotted the
Vita<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.770> mean<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.330> come<00:04:51.630> down<00:04:51.660> to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
Vita I mean I think that's come down to

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.780 
Vita I mean I think that's come down to
some<00:04:52.200> of<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.350> titles<00:04:53.100> maybe<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.490> haven't<00:04:53.670> been

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
some of the titles maybe I haven't been

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.760 
some of the titles maybe I haven't been
as<00:04:54.030> good<00:04:54.060> as<00:04:54.270> what<00:04:54.420> they<00:04:54.570> hoped<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.080> think<00:04:55.590> some

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
as good as what they hoped I think some

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.080 
as good as what they hoped I think some
of<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.920> has<00:04:56.040> got<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:56.670> with<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.910> fact

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
of that has got to do with the fact

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
of that has got to do with the fact
they've<00:04:57.210> not<00:04:57.390> maybe<00:04:57.660> had<00:04:58.440> as<00:04:58.680> many<00:04:58.860> titles<00:04:59.100> and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
they've not maybe had as many titles and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.310 
they've not maybe had as many titles and
development<00:04:59.970> maybe<00:05:00.240> not<00:05:00.480> as<00:05:00.570> many<00:05:00.750> Indies<00:05:01.170> as

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
development maybe not as many Indies as

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.050 
development maybe not as many Indies as
well<00:05:01.500> but<00:05:01.710> we<00:05:02.010> know<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.280> Indies<00:05:02.580> also<00:05:02.880> being

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
well but we know the Indies also being

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.010 
well but we know the Indies also being
pushed<00:05:03.330> heavily<00:05:03.810> towards<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:06.020> PlayStation

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
pushed heavily towards the PlayStation

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.000 
pushed heavily towards the PlayStation

that was that took a whole section of

that was that took a whole section of

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
integration was gonna be between that

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.050 
integration was gonna be between that
and<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.750> PlayStation<00:05:22.260> 4<00:05:22.950> which<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.670> don't

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
and the PlayStation 4 which I don't

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.610 
and the PlayStation 4 which I don't
really<00:05:24.300> mind<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.050> could<00:05:25.260> have<00:05:25.410> some

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
really mind I think it could have some

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.580 
really mind I think it could have some
definite<00:05:25.950> uses<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.900> pity<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.230> course<00:05:28.290> you

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
definite uses it's a pity of course you

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.780 
definite uses it's a pity of course you
can't<00:05:28.800> play<00:05:28.950> over<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.220> internet<00:05:29.550> but<00:05:29.700> of

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
can't play over the internet but of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.400 
can't play over the internet but of
course<00:05:30.000> there's<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.330> latency<00:05:30.750> fact<00:05:31.110> him<00:05:31.290> and

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
course there's that latency fact him and

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.140 
course there's that latency fact him and
I<00:05:31.470> completely<00:05:31.740> understand<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.460> but<00:05:32.700> still

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
I completely understand that but still

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.730 
I completely understand that but still
it's<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.510> be<00:05:33.600> very<00:05:33.720> handy<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.290> think<00:05:34.590> for

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
it's going to be very handy I think for

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.530 
it's going to be very handy I think for
people<00:05:34.860> who<00:05:35.580> only<00:05:35.760> have<00:05:35.850> for<00:05:36.180> example<00:05:36.240> one

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
people who only have for example one

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.720 
people who only have for example one
main<00:05:36.870> screen<00:05:37.290> in<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.500> home<00:05:37.740> or<00:05:38.010> maybe<00:05:38.220> they

main screen in the home or maybe they

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.100 
main screen in the home or maybe they
just<00:05:38.760> fancy<00:05:39.270> playing<00:05:39.510> on<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.690> Vita<00:05:39.870> because

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
just fancy playing on the Vita because

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.560 
just fancy playing on the Vita because

knows what you know goes on in your own
house<00:05:44.340> but<00:05:44.700> regardless<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.750> think<00:05:45.780> it's<00:05:46.080> gonna

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
house but regardless I think it's gonna

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.380 
house but regardless I think it's gonna
be<00:05:46.380> very<00:05:46.560> cool<00:05:46.890> it's<00:05:47.160> very<00:05:47.400> interesting<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.360> me

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
be very cool it's very interesting to me

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.370 
be very cool it's very interesting to me
that<00:05:48.510> mark<00:05:48.870> Cerny

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
that mark Cerny

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.650 
that mark Cerny
was<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:50.220> heavily<00:05:50.670> involved<00:05:51.570> in<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.020> Vitas

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
was so heavily involved in the Vitas

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.480 
was so heavily involved in the Vitas
development<00:05:54.660> but<00:05:55.230> I<00:05:55.320> suppose<00:05:55.680> from<00:05:56.280> the

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
development but I suppose from the

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.160 
development but I suppose from the
design<00:05:56.820> perspective<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.660> makes<00:05:57.930> complete

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
design perspective it makes complete

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.980 
design perspective it makes complete
sense<00:05:58.400> obviously<00:05:59.400> his<00:05:59.880> team<00:06:00.240> had<00:06:00.450> started<00:06:00.870> to

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
sense obviously his team had started to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.200 
sense obviously his team had started to
really<00:06:01.140> heavily<00:06:01.680> -<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:01.860> hear<00:06:02.160> myself<00:06:02.370> forever

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
really heavily - I hear myself forever

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.260 
really heavily - I hear myself forever
it<00:06:03.420> started<00:06:03.810> very<00:06:03.840> heavily<00:06:04.470> focus<00:06:05.400> on<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.910> x86

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
it started very heavily focus on the x86

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.950 
it started very heavily focus on the x86
architecture<00:06:06.690> back<00:06:07.380> in<00:06:07.650> 207<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:10.790> obviously

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
architecture back in 207 so obviously

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360 
architecture back in 207 so obviously
they'd<00:06:12.960> kind<00:06:13.320> of<00:06:13.440> knew<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:13.890> they<00:06:13.980> wanted<00:06:14.250> a

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
they'd kind of knew that they wanted a

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.680 
they'd kind of knew that they wanted a
lot<00:06:14.550> of<00:06:14.640> integration<00:06:15.150> between<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.450> two

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
lot of integration between the two

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.440 
lot of integration between the two
devices<00:06:15.930> it<00:06:16.230> makes<00:06:16.410> sense<00:06:16.680> because<00:06:17.450> well

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
devices it makes sense because well

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.180 
devices it makes sense because well
let's<00:06:18.480> face<00:06:18.690> it<00:06:18.840> they<00:06:19.500> want<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:19.860> to<00:06:19.980> buy<00:06:20.130> as

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
let's face it they want you to buy as

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.530 
let's face it they want you to buy as
many<00:06:20.430> devices<00:06:20.670> as<00:06:20.970> possible<00:06:21.120> which<00:06:21.510> is

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
many devices as possible which is

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.140 
many devices as possible which is
completely<00:06:22.020> utterly<00:06:22.170> understandable<00:06:23.150> anyway

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
completely utterly understandable anyway

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.820 
completely utterly understandable anyway
I<00:06:24.300> think<00:06:24.420> that's<00:06:24.780> just<00:06:25.020> about<00:06:25.320> it<00:06:25.530> for<00:06:25.590> this

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
I think that's just about it for this

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.320 
I think that's just about it for this
particular<00:06:26.070> video<00:06:26.370> hopefully<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.000> found<00:06:27.150> it

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
particular video hopefully you found it

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.090 
particular video hopefully you found it
somewhat<00:06:27.600> interesting<00:06:27.780> Oh<00:06:28.230> we'll<00:06:28.860> see<00:06:29.040> you

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
somewhat interesting Oh we'll see you

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:50.090 
somewhat interesting Oh we'll see you
soon<00:06:29.400> take<00:06:29.910> care<00:06:29.970> bye<00:06:30.240> for<00:06:30.750> now

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.160 

you
