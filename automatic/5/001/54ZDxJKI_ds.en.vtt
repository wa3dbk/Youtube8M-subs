00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.579
 the transmission is composed of three 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.140
 parts the rear axle 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.300
 the mechanical part is the exact if on 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.010
 the back deck we're going to have some 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.449
 cuts that are equipped with weapons 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 These reductions will be slowed down 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.089
 by the hoses you find here 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.010
 a little bit ahead of this bridge we have 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.809
 so a lid that will enclose a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.390
 variable displacement pump 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.610
 this variable displacement pump is 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.610
 managed by regulations that we find 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.220
 here a maximum pressure regulation 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.439
 and the other way and we will find 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.500
 also on this lid the pressure 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.689
 maximum transmission 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.970
 the power of management 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.880
 information load sensing filters 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.820
 you have several types of filters on 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.950
 a tractor we will first find the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 suction filter the one that we 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.940
 captures this pollution 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.120
 in the cart box of the tractor then you 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 will provide this oil to the skin and 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.580
 it will go up in pressure depending on 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.800
 efforts requested of him 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.920
 when this pressure goes up we go 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.860
 so ask to filter again 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.850
 the oil and we'll talk about a hp filter 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.460
 for high pressure this is still a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.220
 time to capture the present pollution 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.580
 in the fluid in order to take this 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.070
 tile to distributors who are 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.070
 quite sensitive to the pollution of the river
