too too too heavy-handed too opaque Lee
and<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> keep<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and you know keep some of that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290 
and you know keep some of that
translucency<00:00:20.340> may<00:00:20.580> keep<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
translucency may keep some of the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
translucency may keep some of the
transparency<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.189> see

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
transparency in there so you can see

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320 
transparency in there so you can see
underneath<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.680> form<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> into<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> line

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
underneath the form and into the line

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:45.900 
underneath the form and into the line
work<00:00:27.480> sometimes

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.810 

there's<00:00:46.870> something<00:00:46.989> magical<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.620> happens

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
something you know knowing how to do

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.090 
something you know knowing how to do
that<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:56.020> be<00:00:56.140> very<00:00:56.590> very<00:00:56.860> powerful<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:59.440> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
that can be very very powerful in in the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.580 
that can be very very powerful in in the
production<00:01:00.430> field<00:01:00.879> in<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.050> visual

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
production field in the visual

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.650 
production field in the visual
production<00:01:02.739> field<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.370> just<00:01:03.610> being<00:01:04.300> able<00:01:04.420> to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
production field it's just being able to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.109 
production field it's just being able to
distinguish<00:01:05.170> materials<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:06.119> really

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
distinguish materials is really

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.940 
distinguish materials is really
important<00:01:07.630> whether<00:01:08.470> you're<00:01:08.619> working<00:01:08.680> on

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
important whether you're working on

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.930

working on on a model of your your
creation<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:33.580> know<00:01:33.700> we'll<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:33.970> able<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.180> see

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
creation you know we'll be able to see

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.690 
creation you know we'll be able to see
those<00:01:35.050> materials<00:01:35.380> for<00:01:35.680> what<00:01:35.800> they<00:01:35.920> are<00:01:35.950> you

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
those materials for what they are you

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.510 
those materials for what they are you
know<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.560> more<00:01:38.740> information<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.250> better

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
know and the more information the better

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.279 
know and the more information the better
for<00:01:39.789> them<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.539> better<00:01:40.720> for<00:01:40.899> you<00:01:41.020> as<00:01:41.140> well

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
for them and the better for you as well

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.850 
for them and the better for you as well
because<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.820> your<00:01:43.330> creation<00:01:43.810> kind<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.710> like

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
because your your creation kind of like

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.910 
because your your creation kind of like
will<00:01:45.100> make<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.430> transition<00:01:45.670> into<00:01:46.149> 3d<00:01:46.920> so

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
will make that transition into 3d so

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.660 
will make that transition into 3d so
it's<00:01:48.280> really<00:01:48.460> important<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:50.310> also<00:01:51.310> like<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.520> use

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
it's really important I also like to use

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's really important I also like to use
the<00:01:51.759> lasso<00:01:52.149> tool<00:01:52.179> and<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:53.110> resize<00:01:53.530> tool<00:01:53.890> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the lasso tool and the resize tool to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.440 
the lasso tool and the resize tool to
scale<00:01:56.860> up<00:01:57.009> things<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.580> then<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.060> use<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.300> Move

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
scale up things and then I use the Move

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.980 
scale up things and then I use the Move
tool<00:01:58.479> as<00:01:58.840> well<00:01:58.869> to<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.390> fix<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.720> drawing

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
tool as well to to fix the drawing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.940 
tool as well to to fix the drawing
sometimes<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.929> it's<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.349> a<00:02:05.560> photo<00:02:05.800> show

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
sometimes so it's it in a photo show

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.490 
sometimes so it's it in a photo show
that's<00:02:06.099> really<00:02:06.310> powerful
