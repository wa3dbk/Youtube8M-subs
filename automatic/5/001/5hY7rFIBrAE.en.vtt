00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
certain user interface elements so that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.580 
certain user interface elements so that
people<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.540> comfortable<00:02:18.900> using<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
people are really comfortable using it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.620 
people are really comfortable using it
and<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.950> feels<00:02:20.160> natural<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.300> android

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and it feels natural so with android

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.030 
and it feels natural so with android
we've<00:02:21.810> done<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> same<00:02:22.260> thing<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.739> taking

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
we've done the same thing and taking

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
we've done the same thing and taking
advantage<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.360> lower<00:02:24.959> level

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
advantage of some of the lower level

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.070 
advantage of some of the lower level
device<00:02:26.010> functionality<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:26.850> well<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.690> create

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
device functionality as well to create

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.110 
device functionality as well to create
some<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.769> features<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.580> we<00:02:29.819> think<00:02:30.030> are

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
some some features that we think are

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
some some features that we think are
pretty<00:02:30.569> pretty<00:02:31.050> nice<00:02:31.290> well<00:02:31.800> i<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.069> say<00:02:32.220> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
pretty pretty nice well i can say that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.120 
pretty pretty nice well i can say that
the<00:02:32.489> application<00:02:32.819> was<00:02:33.060> great<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:34.470> very<00:02:34.620> very

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the application was great it's very very

question is that everybody is talking

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.970 
question is that everybody is talking
about<00:02:39.209> whether<00:02:39.690> or<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.110> android<00:02:40.650> market

will have you know the impact at all of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.470 
will have you know the impact at all of
the<00:02:43.650> app<00:02:44.069> stores<00:02:44.519> had<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.060> apple<00:02:45.390> app<00:02:45.420> store

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480

what<00:02:46.049> do<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.910> inverts<00:02:48.209> going

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
what do you think I think inverts going

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.059 
what do you think I think inverts going
to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.569> really<00:02:48.900> big<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.319> actually<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:49.860> it's

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
to be really big I actually think it's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.850 
to be really big I actually think it's
that<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.560> platform<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.739> be

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
that the it's the platform to be

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.910 
that the it's the platform to be
watching<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.670> next<00:02:53.970> year<00:02:54.410> what<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.590> will

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
see is as I mentioned getting turned on

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.370 
see is as I mentioned getting turned on
in<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> lot<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> new<00:02:58.829> markets<00:02:59.310> and<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:01.019> really

in a lot of new markets and it's really

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.350 
in a lot of new markets and it's really
much<00:03:01.590> more<00:03:01.769> customizable<00:03:02.400> than<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.970> iphone

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
much more customizable than the iphone

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.390 
much more customizable than the iphone
operating<00:03:03.840> system<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.350> example<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.250> we'll

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
operating system for example so we'll

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
operating system for example so we'll
see<00:03:05.579> different<00:03:06.000> kinds<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.360> devices<00:03:06.630> come<00:03:07.079> out

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
see different kinds of devices come out

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.569 
see different kinds of devices come out
that<00:03:07.410> they<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:07.680> into<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.190> Android<00:03:08.489> operating

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
systems well looking forward to seeing

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.580 
systems well looking forward to seeing
