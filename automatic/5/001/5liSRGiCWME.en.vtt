going to line our upper lash line I like
to<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.780> very<00:02:18.170> thin<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> very<00:02:19.910> thin

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
to do very thin I like to do a very thin

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.750 
to do very thin I like to do a very thin
line<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.860> an<00:02:22.010> everyday<00:02:22.190> look

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
line because this is an everyday look

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.809 
line because this is an everyday look
and<00:02:23.120> um<00:02:24.220> normally<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.250> don't<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> lot<00:02:25.790> of

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and um normally I don't have a lot of

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.110 
and um normally I don't have a lot of
time<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.569> spend<00:02:27.400> fussing<00:02:28.400> on<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.580> liner<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.090> I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
time to spend fussing on the liner so I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.259 
time to spend fussing on the liner so I
just<00:02:29.360> do<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.569> really<00:02:30.430> thin<00:02:31.430> line<00:02:31.700> close<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
just do a really thin line close to the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.729 
just do a really thin line close to the
lash<00:02:32.420> line<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:33.019> too<00:02:33.200> difficult<00:02:33.319> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
lash line it's not too difficult and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.350 
lash line it's not too difficult and
then<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:34.100> kind<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.430> thickened<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.000> up<00:02:35.120> here

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
then I just kind of thickened it up here

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.509 
then I just kind of thickened it up here
at<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.480> eye<00:02:35.569> but<00:02:35.900> not<00:02:36.050> by<00:02:36.230> much<00:02:36.410> let's<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.400> to

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
at the eye but not by much let's go to

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.340 
at the eye but not by much let's go to
make<00:02:37.700> sure<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.060> even<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:38.989> for<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
make sure it's all even now for the
