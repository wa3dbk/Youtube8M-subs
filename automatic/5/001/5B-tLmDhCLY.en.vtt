00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.690
 what to eat how I like to eat your own 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.709
 and eat meat 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.709
 I am a carnivore 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.210
 Well, do not excuse me, eating is not a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.730
 addiction can be transformed with some 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.910
 eating foods in a matter 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.669
 repetitious repetitive no nutritional or 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.480
 even in ground wire to 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 displeasure but in an automatic act 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.220
 for which the food was not created 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.210
 depends on the income of a certain type of 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:50.320
 not so not so nutritious nutrients 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.590
 to an organism that was not prepared 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.810
 to receive so much quantity so much 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.620
 repetition of the same so much taste 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.620
 exciting at the level of the palate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.609
 a sometimes pleasurable relationship 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.480
 is guilty 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.170
 depends on 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.390
 as soon as one exceeds oneself and how much good 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.780
 like to be well and healthy things 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.120
 and that hunger that I have makes me 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 return to eat the color makes you choose 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.500
 certain foods very rich meals 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 very rich also have an action on 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.700
 my brain and proteins that are what 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.140
 transmit sensations to the brain 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.830
 of pleasure of serenity then we have 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.570
 good meal is was that 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.930
 he was seeing in recent years have 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 an action equivalent to cocaine 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:55.250
 about brain dopamine generating 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:59.060
 energy and desire and that was sugar 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.460
 would act on through over 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.700
 precursors of serotonin which is another 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.490
 neurotransmitter generating a substance 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.599
 external one very anti-stress 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.599
