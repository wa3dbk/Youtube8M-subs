00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you're going to you know bite into it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.050 
you're going to you know bite into it
you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> brace<00:02:10.289> yourself

something<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.500> all<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:13.920> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
something like that is all I'm going to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
something like that is all I'm going to
do<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.730> my<00:02:14.819> garlic<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.390> don't<00:02:16.050> feel<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> need

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
do for my garlic I don't feel the need

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.460

to<00:02:16.709> mince<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.790> up<00:02:17.880> until<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.360> garlic<00:02:19.260> paste

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
to mince it up until it's garlic paste

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.559 
to mince it up until it's garlic paste
that's<00:02:19.980> pointless<00:02:20.910> because<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.360> way<00:02:21.450> you're

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
that's pointless because that way you're

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.900 
that's pointless because that way you're
hiding<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.959> from<00:02:22.020> somebody<00:02:22.290> or<00:02:22.610> you're<00:02:23.610> hiding

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
hiding it from somebody or you're hiding

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.220 
hiding it from somebody or you're hiding
the<00:02:24.000> ingredient<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.020> agree<00:02:25.170> with

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the ingredient which I don't agree with

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.520 
the ingredient which I don't agree with
so<00:02:25.620> let's<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.520> ahead<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.050> work<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.260> getting

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
so let's go ahead and work on getting

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.960 
so let's go ahead and work on getting
our<00:02:28.739> pot<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.040> ready<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.550> suing<00:02:29.849> off
