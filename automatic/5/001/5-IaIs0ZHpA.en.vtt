00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello good welcome again to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.080
 channel today to make a tutorial a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.849
 little bit more serious about brushes that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.849
 you have asked and we are going to do 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.960
 there is nothing the amount for the market 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.990
 I always recommend the arm 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.750
 I great for me to serve the manes 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.029
 this is the simple one then we have the go 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 behind that is a little bit more complete 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.160
 that this is to say everything is boar of the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 safe house then this one for those who 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.420
 have the hair one more point 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.180
 punished with wicks or is not going to 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 care much better and to prevent it from 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.979
 break the one we are using 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.979
 also brushes 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.530
 years ago that too 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.110
 these your brush have a film 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.059
 come that are resins soaps 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.800
 then the frames never break and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.800
 apart what are the sows 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 here we have the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.550
 movies that are redonditos also 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.430
 for hair that you have 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.290
 you throw me hair with color changes 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.409
 color I always recommend that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.710
 you use brushes 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.049
 of way or resin and with the stones 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.909
 that they walked away because that's going to take care 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.950
 much hair does not part fixing 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.970
 who gives them to us gives us a little bit more 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.800
 memory is what is the finish 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.240
 Hair care especially is a lot 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.040
 more important to get 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 then we have the plastics too 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.720
 on the metal ones on the house 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 thermal also for 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.760
 to smooth and for the will of form 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.610
 of skin has a peculiarity that as 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.580
 they are thermal they heat what I do not 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.440
 I would recommend it a lot is for 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.600
 Y 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.760
 and we put on a mask and we have left 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.760
 but super soft and we have left 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.929
 and then we start to dry the kisses 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.120
 brushes and happened what they have is that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.100
 how it takes a lot of temperature if we 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.330
 we went through many passes 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.940
 then we return the hair to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.340
 to practice 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.200
 I recommend more wood brushes for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 that sometimes is a little punished this 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 more for hair that would be a type of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 more natural hair because they will not wear 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.120
 the reflection title that was a 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.120
 softer reflex 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.450
 we have the little one and we have the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.819
 reality 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.480
 Well, here we have the hair that I eat 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.480
 we say for 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.800
 the father is the natural 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.470
 to ruin others 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.450
 delivery very easily to review this 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 type of mane what we used 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.580
