lens let me show you what I mean in this
particular<00:00:18.359> instance<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.650> UV<00:00:20.369> filter

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
particular instance this is a UV filter

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
particular instance this is a UV filter
and<00:00:21.080> really<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.230> looks<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.800> clear

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
