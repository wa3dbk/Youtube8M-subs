you know that's a good question but it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.540 
you know that's a good question but it's
a<00:00:22.439> loaded<00:00:22.859> question

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a loaded question

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.689 
a loaded question
and<00:00:23.760> let<00:00:24.210> me<00:00:24.330> explain<00:00:24.630> explain<00:00:25.350> why<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.550> know

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and let me explain explain why you know

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
and let me explain explain why you know
in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.660> past<00:00:27.960> years<00:00:28.289> ago<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:28.920> lots<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
in the past years ago there was lots of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.429 
in the past years ago there was lots of
holes<00:00:29.640> filled<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.359> body<00:00:30.599> filler<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.289> would

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
holes filled with body filler you would

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100 
holes filled with body filler you would
use<00:00:31.650> those<00:00:31.859> dent<00:00:32.579> pullers<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.809> had<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
use those dent pullers they had the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.889 
use those dent pullers they had the
screws<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.649> end<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.270> drill<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
screws on the end and you would drill a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.369 
screws on the end and you would drill a
hole<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.910> then<00:00:38.910> pop<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.960> then

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
hole and then pop that out and back then

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.490 
hole and then pop that out and back then
is<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.879> told<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.870> actually

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
is what I was told is that actually

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
is what I was told is that actually
allows<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> body<00:00:44.370> filler<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.879> go<00:00:45.000> through<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
allows the body filler to go through the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.619 
allows the body filler to go through the
hole<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.579> grab<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.510> know

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hole and then grab on to it you know

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
hole and then grab on to it you know
better<00:00:48.960> adhesion<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
better adhesion because it would you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.090 
better adhesion because it would you
know<00:00:50.399> hang<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> metal<00:00:51.960> better<00:00:52.199> but

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
know hang on to the metal better but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
know hang on to the metal better but
that<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.570> there's<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.899> good<00:00:55.140> for

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that also you know there's not good for

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.459 
that also you know there's not good for
corrosion<00:00:55.800> protection<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.289> that's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
corrosion protection and you know that's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.549 
corrosion protection and you know that's
kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> where<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> problem<00:00:59.760> at<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
kind of where you have a problem at is a

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.950 
kind of where you have a problem at is a
poor<00:01:01.820> corrosion<00:01:02.820> protection<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> holes

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
poor corrosion protection with the holes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
poor corrosion protection with the holes
in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> metal<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.619> anyway<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.270> have<00:01:06.270> seen<00:01:06.510> body

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in the metal but anyway I have seen body

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.010 
in the metal but anyway I have seen body
filler<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.350> holes<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.950> lasted<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.610> years

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
filler over holes that lasted for years

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.289 
filler over holes that lasted for years
you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> still<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.850> year<00:01:12.119> we've

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you know I still with this year we've

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.980 
you know I still with this year we've
got<00:01:12.330> into<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:14.119> we<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> one

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
got into some that we got into this one

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.230 
got into some that we got into this one
a<00:01:16.020> student<00:01:16.380> body<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.729> older<00:01:18.060> pickup<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
didn't look that bad at the body line

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
didn't look that bad at the body line
built<00:01:23.130> into<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.670> everything<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> was

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
built into it and everything but it was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.190 
built into it and everything but it was
all<00:01:24.540> body<00:01:24.810> filler

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
all body filler

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
all body filler
I'm<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.830> kidding<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.400> probably<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.790> inch

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I'm not kidding it's probably an inch

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
I'm not kidding it's probably an inch
and<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> half<00:01:27.210> thick<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.020> no<00:01:28.829> telling<00:01:29.159> how<00:01:29.310> long

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and a half thick and no telling how long

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.690 
and a half thick and no telling how long
it's<00:01:29.700> been<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.990> now<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.520> not

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's been there now you know it's not

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's been there now you know it's not
recommended<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> thick<00:01:34.110> it's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
recommended that it be that thick it's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
recommended that it be that thick it's
really<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.770> recommended<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.579> put<00:01:35.939> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
really not recommended that it be put in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.140 
really not recommended that it be put in
holes<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:37.590> question<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.850> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
holes but your question is is we can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.859 
holes but your question is is we can
well<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.280> been<00:01:41.579> done<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
well you can it has been done but it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.639 
well you can it has been done but it's
really<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.950> recommended<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
really you know it's not recommended I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.950 
really you know it's not recommended I
just<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> corrosion<00:01:47.189> protection

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
just don't have the corrosion protection

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
just don't have the corrosion protection
I<00:01:51.409> can<00:01:52.409> understand<00:01:52.890> maybe<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.340> wanting<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I can understand maybe not wanting to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
I can understand maybe not wanting to
weld<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> hose<00:01:54.299> especially<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
weld the hose especially if you're not a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
weld the hose especially if you're not a
welder<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:56.850> afraid<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.329> you

welder or if you're afraid that you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
might warp it because I've seen more

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
might warp it because I've seen more
damage<00:01:59.939> done<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:01.020> welding<00:02:01.799> something

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
damage done you know welding something

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.289 
damage done you know welding something
you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> how<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you know if you're not don't know how to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.609 
you know if you're not don't know how to
weld<00:02:03.540> those<00:02:03.630> thin<00:02:03.899> metals<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.560> be

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
weld those thin metals you got to be

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.670 
weld those thin metals you got to be
careful<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> warp<00:02:06.810> warping

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
careful you know all that warp warping

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
careful you know all that warp warping
that<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> mess

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that you do you know it's just a mess

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
that you do you know it's just a mess
so<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> would<00:02:10.800> probably<00:02:11.069> try<00:02:11.730> rather<00:02:12.090> than

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so what I would probably try rather than

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550 
so what I would probably try rather than
body<00:02:12.510> filler<00:02:12.930> because<00:02:13.200> by

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
body filler because by

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979 
body filler because by
people<00:02:13.800> does<00:02:13.980> not<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.819> know<00:02:14.849> absorb<00:02:15.390> absorb

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
people does not you know absorb absorb

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.420 
people does not you know absorb absorb
some<00:02:16.560> moisture<00:02:17.099> but<00:02:17.819> if<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:18.959> that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
some moisture but if you go and get that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.190 
some moisture but if you go and get that
fiberglass<00:02:20.430> filler<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.480> know<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.900> works

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
fiberglass filler you know that works

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100 
fiberglass filler you know that works
really<00:02:22.500> well<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:24.150> does<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> lot

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
really well and that does do a lot

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.920 
really well and that does do a lot
better<00:02:25.349> job<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.770> sealing<00:02:26.220> off<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.690> hole

better job of sealing off the the hole

better job of sealing off the the hole

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
you know where moisture can't get in and

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.410 
you know where moisture can't get in and
this<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.849> I'm<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.090> talking<00:02:36.360> about

hair or you know some thing like that

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.229 
hair or you know some thing like that
and<00:02:46.170> really<00:02:46.350> they've<00:02:47.160> got<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> long<00:02:47.700> strand<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and really they've got a long strand and

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.030 
and really they've got a long strand and
Short<00:02:48.569> Strand<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.470> something<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.920> know

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
Short Strand for something you know

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.770 
Short Strand for something you know
something<00:02:50.280> small<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.060> would<00:02:51.239> use<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.510> short

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
something small I would use this short

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.970 
something small I would use this short
string<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> seems<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.769> it's<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
string because it seems like it's a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.180 
string because it seems like it's a
little<00:02:53.040> bit<00:02:53.160> easier<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.610> work<00:02:54.769> still<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:56.100> know

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
little bit easier to work still you know

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
little bit easier to work still you know
that's<00:02:56.370> probably<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.660> correct

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that's probably not the the correct

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.539 
that's probably not the the correct
answer<00:02:58.560> you<00:03:00.080> know<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.230> best<00:03:02.099> thing<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.430> you

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
answer you know the best thing that you

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.289 
answer you know the best thing that you
can<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.209> put<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:04.110> know<00:03:04.230> weld<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> hole<00:03:04.739> up

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
can do is put you know weld the hole up

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.400 
can do is put you know weld the hole up
but<00:03:06.299> uh<00:03:07.519> but<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.690> really<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.140> blast

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
but uh but I really think if I blast

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.620 
but uh but I really think if I blast
work<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:10.950> let<00:03:11.130> me<00:03:11.250> tell<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.640> what<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.450> do

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
work but let me tell you what you do

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.720 
work but let me tell you what you do
want<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.019> if<00:03:13.140> you're<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> fill<00:03:13.739> that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.319 

you<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> flat<00:03:18.390> hole<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:21.090> right

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
you just have a flat hole this right

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.270 
you just have a flat hole this right
here<00:03:21.540> hopefully<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:21.989> see<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.320> if<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
here hopefully you can see this if you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.330 
here hopefully you can see this if you
have<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> hole<00:03:24.350> or<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.620> your<00:03:25.799> deck<00:03:26.040> lit<00:03:26.250> or

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
have a hole or like your deck lit or

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.599 
have a hole or like your deck lit or
something<00:03:26.640> you're<00:03:26.730> filling<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.090> up<00:03:27.150> and

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
something you're filling that up and

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.199 
something you're filling that up and
then<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.640> put<00:03:30.030> some<00:03:30.269> body<00:03:30.510> filler<00:03:30.870> or

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
then you put some body filler or

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.309 
then you put some body filler or
fiberglass<00:03:33.209> over<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.049> sand

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
fiberglass over that and then you sand

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.770 
fiberglass over that and then you sand
it<00:03:34.440> off<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.880> really<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.390> nothing<00:03:36.720> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
it off you really don't have nothing to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.930 
it off you really don't have nothing to
hold<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.410> right<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.819> it's

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
hold on to right here you know it's

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.020 
hold on to right here you know it's
probably<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.420> fall<00:03:39.600> out<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.910> what<00:03:41.910> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
probably going to fall out so what you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.530 
probably going to fall out so what you
may<00:03:42.180> want<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.450> do<00:03:42.630> before<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.200> apply<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.799> is

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
may want to do before you apply that is

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.530 
may want to do before you apply that is
get<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.569> hammer<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:47.730> punch<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.269> kind<00:03:48.480> of

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
get a hammer and a punch that kind of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.200 
get a hammer and a punch that kind of
fees<00:03:49.350> down<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.859> hole<00:03:50.040> Kai<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.430> this

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.120 

you<00:03:56.080> know<00:03:56.170> we're<00:03:56.440> kind<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.800> go<00:03:56.860> through<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
you know we're kind of go through the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.310 
you know we're kind of go through the
hope<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.550> not<00:03:57.940> much<00:03:58.180> but<00:03:58.390> lightly<00:03:58.780> hit<00:03:59.140> it

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
hope and not much but lightly hit it

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.260 
hope and not much but lightly hit it
well<00:03:59.950> what<00:04:00.100> you're<00:04:00.220> going<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.490> create<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:01.210> a

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
well what you're going to create is a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.660 
well what you're going to create is a
divot<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:05.620> whenever<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.220> sand<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:06.610> off

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
divot now whenever you sand that off

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.770 
divot now whenever you sand that off
you're<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.820> have<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.600> hold

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
you're going to have that for it to hold

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.420 
you're going to have that for it to hold
on<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.230> hope<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.560> makes<00:04:11.740> sense<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.160> know<00:04:12.280> it's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
on to hope that makes sense I know it's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.250 
on to hope that makes sense I know it's
kind<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:12.760> hard<00:04:12.820> with<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.270> little<00:04:14.080> notepad

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
kind of hard with this little notepad

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.400 
kind of hard with this little notepad
here<00:04:14.740> but<00:04:15.870> basically<00:04:16.870> you're<00:04:17.050> taking<00:04:17.200> that

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
here but basically you're taking that

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.410 
here but basically you're taking that
hole<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.010> just<00:04:18.580> knock<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.850> down<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.210> little

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
hole and you just knock it down a little

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.210 
hole and you just knock it down a little
bit<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.960> that<00:04:20.440> gives<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.890> fiberglass

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
bit and that gives the fiberglass

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.090 
bit and that gives the fiberglass
something<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.850> hold<00:04:22.000> on<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.240> rather<00:04:23.140> than<00:04:23.470> you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
something to hold on to rather than you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.480 
something to hold on to rather than you
know<00:04:24.130> just<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.520> flat<00:04:24.850> surface<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:27.340> answer

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
know just that flat surface so to answer

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.940 
know just that flat surface so to answer
your<00:04:27.670> question<00:04:28.240> yes<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.930> can't<00:04:29.380> be<00:04:29.740> applied

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
your question yes it can't be applied

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.890 
your question yes it can't be applied
over<00:04:30.190> holes<00:04:30.520> those<00:04:30.760> aren't<00:04:31.060> too<00:04:31.180> big<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.810> know

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
over holes those aren't too big you know

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.480 
over holes those aren't too big you know
spoiler<00:04:32.230> hole<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.530> probably<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.890> pretty<00:04:33.130> small

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
spoiler hole is probably a pretty small

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.150 
spoiler hole is probably a pretty small
and<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.270> has<00:04:34.480> been<00:04:34.780> in<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> past<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.590> it's

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
and it has been in the past and it's

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.190 
and it has been in the past and it's
held<00:04:36.370> for<00:04:36.430> years<00:04:36.850> on<00:04:37.060> some<00:04:37.330> things<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:37.930> I

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
held for years on some things but I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.160 
held for years on some things but I
would<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:39.190> prefer<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.180> do<00:04:40.330> fiberglass<00:04:40.960> if

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
would I prefer to do fiberglass if

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.680 
would I prefer to do fiberglass if
anything<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:42.370> know<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.790> probably<00:04:43.300> what<00:04:43.540> your

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
anything you know so probably what your

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.870 
anything you know so probably what your
choices<00:04:43.870> are<00:04:44.080> going<00:04:44.140> to<00:04:44.290> be<00:04:44.350> one<00:04:44.650> welded<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.400> I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
choices are going to be one welded and I

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.000 
choices are going to be one welded and I
still<00:04:46.180> like<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.480> put<00:04:46.660> fiberglass<00:04:46.930> filler<00:04:47.560> over

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
still like to put fiberglass filler over

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.950 
still like to put fiberglass filler over
welds<00:04:48.490> just<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.240> case<00:04:49.420> there's<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.690> tiny

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
welds just in case there's a tiny

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.770 
welds just in case there's a tiny
pinhole<00:04:50.290> or<00:04:50.800> something<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.640> if<00:04:52.600> you're

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
pinhole or something like that if you're

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.660 
pinhole or something like that if you're
ticking<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.410> know<00:04:53.440> there<00:04:53.740> he<00:04:53.950> probably<00:04:54.250> don't

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
ticking you know there he probably don't

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.450 
ticking you know there he probably don't
need<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.940> do<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.090> but<00:04:55.930> first<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.950> weld<00:04:57.250> and

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
need to do that but first is weld and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.430 
need to do that but first is weld and
fiberglass<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.390> then<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.810> can<00:04:58.990> apply<00:04:59.110> body

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
fiberglass and then you can apply body

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.370 
fiberglass and then you can apply body
filler<00:04:59.770> over<00:04:59.890> that<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:01.720> second<00:05:02.080> one<00:05:02.200> would<00:05:02.320> be

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
filler over that the second one would be

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.310 
filler over that the second one would be
fiberglass<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.460> seal<00:05:03.700> it<00:05:03.820> off<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.240> then<00:05:04.960> apply

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
fiberglass to seal it off and then apply

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.470 
fiberglass to seal it off and then apply
some<00:05:05.350> body<00:05:06.100> fillers<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.670> help<00:05:06.850> smooth<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.300> out

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
some body fillers to help smooth it out

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.440 
some body fillers to help smooth it out
on<00:05:07.720> top<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:09.760> third<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.330> know
