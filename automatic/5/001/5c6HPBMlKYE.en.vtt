at the end of the time they will be
thrown<00:04:53.470> into<00:04:53.500> hell<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.250> know<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.580> we<00:04:54.700> struggle

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150

thrown into hell I know that we struggle
with<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.450> but<00:04:55.750> we're<00:04:55.930> not<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.260> one<00:04:56.440> who

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
with that but we're not the one who
