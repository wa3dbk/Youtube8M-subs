well<00:00:05.910> my<00:00:06.060> thoughts<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.049> think<00:00:07.849> the<00:00:08.849> team<00:00:09.090> tried

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
well my thoughts I think the team tried

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.379 
well my thoughts I think the team tried
really<00:00:09.750> hard<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:11.940> asked<00:00:12.179> him<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
really hard to do what we asked him to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.089 
really hard to do what we asked him to
do<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.870> know<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.139> asked<00:00:13.410> him<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> step<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> up

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
do you know we asked him to step it up

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.029 
do you know we asked him to step it up
after<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.460> Honduras<00:00:14.940> came<00:00:15.150> another<00:00:15.360> nut<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
after the Honduras came another nut and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.950 
after the Honduras came another nut and
they<00:00:17.039> did<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> brilliant<00:00:18.660> first

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
they did that I think a brilliant first

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
they did that I think a brilliant first
half<00:00:19.199> created<00:00:19.710> lots<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.039> chances<00:00:20.390> didn't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
half created lots of chances didn't

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
half created lots of chances didn't
score<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.660> didn't<00:00:22.230> allow<00:00:22.410> anything<00:00:22.830> for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
score but didn't allow anything for

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.330 
score but didn't allow anything for
Ecuador<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.949> we<00:00:25.949> had<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> make

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
Ecuador at all there then we had to make

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550 
Ecuador at all there then we had to make
some<00:00:26.550> changes<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.900> also<00:00:28.109> because

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
some changes we make them also because

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
some changes we make them also because
we<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> give<00:00:29.070> players<00:00:29.630> possibilities<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
we want to give players possibilities to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.120 
we want to give players possibilities to
express<00:00:31.140> themselves<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.740> show<00:00:31.920> themselves

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
express themselves and show themselves

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.270 
express themselves and show themselves
so<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.700> wrote<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> guys<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
so we wrote it a couple of guys in

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.560 
so we wrote it a couple of guys in
Ecuador<00:00:35.280> second<00:00:35.670> half<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:36.300> into<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
Ecuador second half got better into the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
Ecuador second half got better into the
game<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.879> created<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:38.910> chance<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.480> never

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
game and created some chance but never

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
game and created some chance but never
really<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.620> threat<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.250> Tim<00:00:41.430> Howard<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.090> he

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
really any threat for Tim Howard so he

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.580 
really any threat for Tim Howard so he
never<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.750> had<00:00:42.870> anything<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
never really had anything to do in that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.119 
never really had anything to do in that
game<00:00:43.730> besides<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.809> beautiful<00:00:46.680> goal

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
game besides that one beautiful goal

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.940 
game besides that one beautiful goal
that<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.640> scored<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> makes<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that they scored the kind of makes you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
that they scored the kind of makes you
feel<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:50.940> that

effort<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> work<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> know

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
effort in there all that work you know

effort in there all that work you know
and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.520> shoe<00:00:53.820> should<00:00:54.180> get

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and you think actually shoe should get

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.080 
and you think actually shoe should get
aborted<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:56.039> went<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> other<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.579> around

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
aborted but it went the other way around

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
aborted but it went the other way around
and<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:58.020> good<00:00:58.109> experience<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:59.039> us

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and this is very good experience for us

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
and this is very good experience for us
to<00:00:59.940> make<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.660> important<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.440> these

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to make this is important for these

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.950 
to make this is important for these
players<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.300> understand<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.690> little

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
players to understand that one little

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.920 
players to understand that one little
thing<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.890> change<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> game<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> decide<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
thing can change the game and decide the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.219

and<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.300> growing<00:03:32.660> process<00:03:32.900> we're

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
and it's a it's a growing process we're

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.200 
and it's a it's a growing process we're
going<00:03:33.590> through<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.790> will<00:03:34.970> take<00:03:35.180> time<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
going through that will take time and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.120 
going through that will take time and
obviously<00:03:38.210> also<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.990> couple<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.320> knocks<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.830> I

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
obviously also a couple of knocks that I

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.340 
obviously also a couple of knocks that I
have<00:03:40.460> to<00:03:40.640> accept<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.660> get<00:03:41.840> them<00:03:42.020> on<00:03:42.170> that

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
have to accept and you get them on that

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.310 
have to accept and you get them on that
on<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.650> path<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:44.720> i<00:03:44.750> think<00:03:45.080> if<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.230> look

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
on that path and but i think if you look

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.680 
on that path and but i think if you look
at<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.620> overall<00:03:45.830> roster<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:47.300> have<00:03:47.510> there

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.450 
at the overall roster we have there

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
opportunities in the second half coming

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.070 
opportunities in the second half coming
a<00:05:02.669> bit<00:05:02.700> through<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.300> middle<00:05:03.570> i<00:05:03.660> would<00:05:03.870> say

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
a bit through the middle i would say

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.290 
a bit through the middle i would say
over<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> wings<00:05:05.100> i<00:05:05.340> think<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:05.880> know<00:05:05.940> they

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
over the wings i think you know they

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.420 
over the wings i think you know they
couldn't<00:05:06.539> create<00:05:06.750> anything<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.680> if<00:05:08.010> one

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
couldn't create anything you know if one

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.070

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
of his midfield strings is certainly

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.680 
of his midfield strings is certainly
valencia<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:11.700> didn't<00:05:11.970> see<00:05:12.090> him<00:05:12.180> today<00:05:12.330> he<00:05:12.660> was

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.690 
valencia you didn't see him today he was
not<00:05:12.990> there<00:05:13.140> because<00:05:13.289> Timmy<00:05:13.740> Timmy<00:05:14.100> Chandler

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
not there because Timmy Timmy Chandler

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.820 
not there because Timmy Timmy Chandler
took<00:05:14.880> care<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.060> him<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.350> depends<00:05:16.650> how<00:05:16.770> a

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
took care of him so it depends how a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.400 
took care of him so it depends how a
game<00:05:17.340> goes<00:05:17.610> then<00:05:17.910> throughout<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.510> whole<00:05:18.720> 90

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
game goes then throughout the whole 90

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.770 
game goes then throughout the whole 90
minutes<00:05:19.919> but<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.160> think<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.610> we<00:05:21.090> didn't<00:05:21.419> allow

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
minutes but I think that we didn't allow

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.010 
minutes but I think that we didn't allow
much<00:05:22.500> no<00:05:23.100> but<00:05:23.820> it<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> team<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:24.750> if<00:05:24.900> you

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
much no but it is a team that if you

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.779 
much no but it is a team that if you
allow<00:05:25.200> him<00:05:25.350> than<00:05:25.680> one<00:05:26.010> little<00:05:26.310> thing<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.669> know

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
allow him than one little thing you know

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.529 
allow him than one little thing you know
they<00:05:26.940> can<00:05:27.090> make<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.419> difference<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.539> don't

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
they can make that difference so I don't

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.230 
they can make that difference so I don't
think<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:30.810> we<00:05:31.200> need<00:05:31.229> Phil<00:05:31.500> Vassar

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
think that we need Phil Vassar

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.710 
think that we need Phil Vassar
