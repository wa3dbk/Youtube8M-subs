00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.340
 thank you for the nice weather to help a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.869
 super contract i go to marseille a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 all the people already that they told me in 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.009
 the street 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.509
 you do not have despite the sun good 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.000
 show us your futile team by 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.269
 listening and then help device already 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 4 4 2 why in your opinion or to you that he 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.609
 knows very very well 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 yeah because you're a non-attacker 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.550
 more to the attacker the more you are happy 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 no but it's mostly because it's 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.269
 where I was trained to lorient and you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.089
 know that merit and school beaulieu to 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.839
 the school gourcuff and do the 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.390
 specialists these four cases two 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.530
 versions 2 with guys on the sides 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 go go speakers time and who 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 have me guardian hugo lloris 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 but look in french with steve 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 so I made a choice ego I turn a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 little but the best stats not in play 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.270
 yeah there's one more point 83 steve and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.270
 84 hugo but right now it's sego 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 of an axis raphael evil I think it's 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 one of the most 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.250
 talented and solid in the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.009
 revival I like it a lot and it is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.130
 good head left Gaelic Clichy 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.720
 because it covers my whole defense 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.280
 is so fast he goes so he 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.450
 catch up with a lot of blows and like me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.009
 I will always be the most 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 fast Braille and 1 ball deep 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.420
 often he is there to clog the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 breaches to media right axis 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.100
 soon because I find that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.830
 he is the most complete player 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 in defense to love 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.110
 from my team executives we will say 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.870
 almost never comes out and maquis and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.960
 bacary sagna right a bit for the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.090
 same reason that clichy with his speed 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 then in a real football he 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.030
 would be the inverted 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 also she nor left to the right 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 but the pursuit for having revealed very 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
 green to get through the connivance 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.030
 complicity we put the donors of the same 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.740
 side after we know offensive to the same mime 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 cockroach running adrien blaise 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.540
 parisian vade retro satanas 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.190
 yeah but hey good indisputable 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 as you say he has a cabinet standards 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.400
 and runs from everywhere the ever tired 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.930
 but get a lot of balloons 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.130
 so that's even if it's a Parisian and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.540
 it makes me a little sore, but hey 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 I joined but I'm here is what he 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.910
 al ally and former minister to have it 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.520
 rubbed together in France team so here we go 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.420
 so we will say that we are yes yes yes 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.070
 that's right axis his mother yeah so 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 why good that an offensive player 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.570
 why so low because samir I like 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 well hit happened because he has 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.050
 a quality of percussion in the game and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.550
 he is fast enough to these techniques 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.250
 he has a good shot of both feet 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.440
 so our mullahs so we'll say that we 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.160
 can practically left in rhombus with 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.830
 blaise sentinel and samir a little 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 worry so right a surprise yeah 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
 the speed we come back the speed 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.830
 jonathan biabiany who is very very 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.090
 fast and that has a good quality of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.490
 center so it's easier for them 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.710
 deep balls 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.480
 it happens before everyone else so no 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.640
 this is a choice over the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.740
 great speed v in Algeria has the same 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.140
 style yeah left alexandre eni 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.790
 the same for speed and for 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.400
 center quality although I would like 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.080
 have ribery well left but for 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.880
 the moment this charter is not days 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.920
 for me I do not even have the money 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.510
 necessary to finally get to ask 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.550
 to these gentlemen ladies of fifa who gives 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.750
 the smiles his features in my opinion if you 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.980
 exchanges a month's salary at the om 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.210
 against ribery it should be able to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 negotiate but hey I'll stop playing 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.700
 and from then duty and his share karim a 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.550
 dude will understand sis because I have 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.110
 had the luck rubbed quotas team 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.720
 de France too and I can tell you that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.980
 at the quality level traced that it's 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.300
 maybe the best French player 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.460
 in front of the goal 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.870
 still there on speed of 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.520
 percussion in penetration speed 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.770
 so frankly I play it right he in 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.960
 more but it's amazing and after 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.060
 Who is this guy in blue man what 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.120
 is this piston stroke absolutely to 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.310
 107 there you stole the word I was 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.560
 pistol on this one there 's one that I confess 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.650
 but it's for the good cause it's 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.270
 to be able to play with my player with 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 extraordinary qualities and I 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.910
 I'm going to the specials of the game so 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.980
 gignac speed 92-93 the good ones some 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.540
 find 1.13 to lewai note pass 90 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.770
 dribble 91 the defense 88 n was 89 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:23.060
 maybe 89 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.480
 that's downright yeah yeah yeah I 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.950
 am pretty much in since the 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.600
 exit of the game since I already passed 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.000
 four singing divisions of yverdon 6 so 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.240
 it suits me better and for now 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.920
 where he has 35 goals Lensois Jemaa is obliged 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.620
 to thee benzema passes it on 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.150
 balloon and charges it's better than that 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.230
 work like that here agree that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.090
 now we will play when someone 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.860
 in doubles all the pope role them 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.570
 I hope that then formed my team 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.320
 yes it's so we'll see but it's a 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.200
 mark with ben 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.900
 a challenge guy you go on there 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.520
 see it's gone here it's played well dd 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.730
 but now look at him satu 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.160
 pond 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.500
 but what are you not complaining about 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 and run a bit because I do not do you 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.000
 and I will not do to
