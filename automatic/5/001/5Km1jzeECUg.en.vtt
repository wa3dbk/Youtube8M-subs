53 fee per se as you can see the
operation<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.210> bit<00:02:19.300> different<00:02:19.660> than

operation is a little bit different than

traditional dart blaster shooting arrows

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.850 
traditional dart blaster shooting arrows
is<00:02:21.760> definitely<00:02:22.330> cool<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.110> unique<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
is definitely cool and unique the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.890 
is definitely cool and unique the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
accuracy comes down to the inconsistency

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.600 
accuracy comes down to the inconsistency
of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> launch<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.710> that's<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.190> sort<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.490> an

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
of the launch and that's just sort of an

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.670 
of the launch and that's just sort of an
inherent<00:02:27.930> disadvantage<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.080> using<00:02:29.380> arrows

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
inherent disadvantage of using arrows

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.650 
inherent disadvantage of using arrows
with<00:02:29.890> fins<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> whatnot<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.060> fins<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.480> run

with fins and whatnot the fins can run
into<00:02:31.810> stuff<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> miss<00:02:32.770> launch

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
into stuff you can have a miss launch

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.710 
into stuff you can have a miss launch
however<00:02:33.490> with<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> good<00:02:34.060> launch<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.600> are

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
however with a good launch they are

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390 
however with a good launch they are
pretty<00:02:34.930> accurate<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> velocity<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.160> up

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
pretty accurate and the velocity is up

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
pretty accurate and the velocity is up
there<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> range<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.180> pretty<00:02:37.450> great<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
there in the range is pretty great the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.420 
there in the range is pretty great the
overall<00:02:38.200> performance<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.830> difficult<00:02:39.280> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
overall performance is difficult to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.520 
overall performance is difficult to
compare<00:02:39.820> directly<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.360> darts<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.380> it's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
compare directly to darts but it's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.170 
compare directly to darts but it's
definitely<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.040> fun<00:02:42.370> my<00:02:42.670> overall<00:02:43.030> opinion

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
definitely really fun my overall opinion

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.120 
definitely really fun my overall opinion
on<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.690> blaster<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.230> pretty<00:02:44.500> mixed<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.070> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
on this blaster is pretty mixed it's a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.010 
on this blaster is pretty mixed it's a
very<00:02:45.340> slow<00:02:45.730> rate<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:45.970> fire<00:02:46.090> blaster<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> would

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
very slow rate of fire blaster I would

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.170 
very slow rate of fire blaster I would
not<00:02:47.200> recommend<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.830> as<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> primary<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:49.000> it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
not recommend it as a primary but it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.610 
not recommend it as a primary but it's
sort<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.480> gimmicky<00:02:49.900> blaster<00:02:50.320> like<00:02:50.350> oh<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
sort of a gimmicky blaster like oh I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.930 
sort of a gimmicky blaster like oh I
want<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.040> shoot<00:02:51.220> somebody<00:02:51.430> with<00:02:51.640> an<00:02:51.730> arrow

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
want to go shoot somebody with an arrow

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.060 
want to go shoot somebody with an arrow
just<00:02:52.270> for<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.480> walls<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:53.560> definitely<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
just for the walls it's definitely a

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.830 
just for the walls it's definitely a
great<00:02:54.190> option<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.880> overall<00:02:55.209> performance<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
great option the overall performance of

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
great option the overall performance of
this<00:02:55.989> blaster<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.709> exactly<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:57.580> you'd

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
this blaster is exactly what you'd

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.550 
this blaster is exactly what you'd
expect<00:02:57.820> from<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.330> single<00:02:58.630> shot<00:02:58.810> crossbow<00:02:59.260> style

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
expect from a single shot crossbow style

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530 
expect from a single shot crossbow style
thing<00:02:59.830> having<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.400> trigger<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.910> definitely<00:03:01.450> an

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
thing having a trigger is definitely an

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.660 
thing having a trigger is definitely an
advantage<00:03:01.600> compared<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.350> bow<00:03:02.620> because<00:03:03.520> you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
advantage compared to a bow because you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.460 
advantage compared to a bow because you
can<00:03:03.820> set<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.209> forget<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.020> point<00:03:05.320> and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
can set it forget it and then point and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.960 
can set it forget it and then point and
shoot<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:05.980> lets<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> little<00:03:06.850> bit

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
shoot and it lets you be a little bit

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.370 
shoot and it lets you be a little bit
more<00:03:07.180> accurate<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:07.959> one<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> those

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
more accurate this is one of those

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.960 
more accurate this is one of those
blasters<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.220> can<00:03:09.370> watch<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.730> review

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
blasters that you can watch the review

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.610 
blasters that you can watch the review
watch<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.390> firing<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.959> can<00:03:11.140> know<00:03:11.290> pretty

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
watch the firing and you can know pretty

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.320 
watch the firing and you can know pretty
easily<00:03:12.160> whether<00:03:12.310> or<00:03:12.459> not<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.760> would<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.150> it

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
easily whether or not you would like it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.120 
easily whether or not you would like it
and<00:03:13.450> that's<00:03:13.540> because<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.110> performs<00:03:14.560> exactly

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
and that's because it performs exactly

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.620 
and that's because it performs exactly
how<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.340> would<00:03:15.489> expect<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.090> didn't<00:03:16.330> have<00:03:16.450> any

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
how you would expect I didn't have any

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.270 
how you would expect I didn't have any
jams<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.140> anything<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:17.590> pretty<00:03:17.800> hard<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.070> Jam

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
jams or anything it's pretty hard to Jam

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.770 
jams or anything it's pretty hard to Jam
something<00:03:18.550> like<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.030> if<00:03:19.269> you're<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.600> type

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
something like this if you're the type

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.600 
something like this if you're the type
to<00:03:19.959> use<00:03:20.080> on<00:03:20.230> Orthodox<00:03:20.500> ammo<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.430> just

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
to use on Orthodox ammo and you just

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.190 
to use on Orthodox ammo and you just
like<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.880> hit<00:03:22.000> people<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.870> make<00:03:23.050> them

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
like to hit people and just make them

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.810 
like to hit people and just make them
feel<00:03:23.380> really<00:03:23.680> crappy<00:03:23.980> about<00:03:24.190> getting<00:03:24.550> hit<00:03:24.670> by

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
feel really crappy about getting hit by

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.699 
feel really crappy about getting hit by
a<00:03:25.000> freaking<00:03:25.570> arrow<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.290> is<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> pretty

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
a freaking arrow then this is a pretty

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.229 
a freaking arrow then this is a pretty
viable<00:03:26.920> option<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.820> for<00:03:28.120> that

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
viable option for you for that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.240 
viable option for you for that
unorthodox<00:03:28.630> play<00:03:29.110> style<00:03:29.440> however<00:03:29.830> keep<00:03:30.160> in

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
unorthodox play style however keep in

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.530 
unorthodox play style however keep in
mind<00:03:30.459> these<00:03:30.580> are<00:03:30.640> much<00:03:30.850> heavier<00:03:31.239> than<00:03:31.269> Nerf

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
mind these are much heavier than Nerf

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.540 
mind these are much heavier than Nerf
darts<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:31.930> if<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.140> nerf<00:03:32.350> indoor<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.130> you

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
darts so if you nerf indoor and you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.040 
darts so if you nerf indoor and you
shoot<00:03:33.820> near<00:03:34.060> lamps<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.690> picture<00:03:35.019> frames

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
shoot near lamps and picture frames

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.960 
shoot near lamps and picture frames
these<00:03:35.560> are<00:03:35.739> much<00:03:35.890> heavier<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.489> they<00:03:36.580> carry

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
these are much heavier and they carry

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.580 
these are much heavier and they carry
much<00:03:37.209> more<00:03:37.390> kinetic<00:03:37.720> energy<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.410> can

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
much more kinetic energy so you can

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.170 
much more kinetic energy so you can
blast<00:03:38.920> down<00:03:39.160> picture<00:03:39.519> frames<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.910> can<00:03:39.940> knock

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
blast down picture frames you can knock

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.210 
blast down picture frames you can knock
over<00:03:40.209> lamps<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.780> crap<00:03:40.989> probably<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
over lamps and crap probably not the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.380 
over lamps and crap probably not the
best<00:03:42.250> option<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.820> shoot<00:03:43.000> these<00:03:43.120> thing

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
best option to shoot these thing

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.420 
best option to shoot these thing
indoors<00:03:43.870> compared<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> Nerf<00:03:44.830> dart<00:03:45.100> which<00:03:45.280> is

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
indoors compared to a Nerf dart which is

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.950 
indoors compared to a Nerf dart which is
very<00:03:45.640> lightweight<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.120> no<00:03:46.390> matter<00:03:46.510> how<00:03:46.720> fast

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
very lightweight and no matter how fast

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.540 
very lightweight and no matter how fast
you<00:03:47.140> shoot<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.620> thing<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.010> doesn't<00:03:48.400> have

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
you shoot that thing it doesn't have

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.400 
you shoot that thing it doesn't have
enough<00:03:48.790> energy<00:03:48.970> really<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.870> knock<00:03:50.110> over<00:03:50.290> a

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
enough energy really to knock over a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.960 
enough energy really to knock over a
lamp<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.800> break<00:03:50.980> stuff<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:51.700> fair<00:03:51.940> warning
