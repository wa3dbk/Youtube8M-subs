00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.120
 oil but if you know a little bit he said no 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.310
 it is but it knows not because we use 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.709
 from boston on its outside there are people who do not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.690
 use that taste and that is not due to 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.209
 amount of fat that you have to 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.760
