00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello very good people today I customer in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 a video talking about history a bit 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 changing with the tonic that has come 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 being general in the channel lately and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.679
 I wanted to talk about a curiosity about 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.960
 the Roman soldiers on the legionary 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.710
 like a Roman and as you can see in the image 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.970
 and here we have what would be first 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.010
 that comes to mind if we 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.170
 they talk about Roman soldier if someone 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 says I think of a Roman soldier more or 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 less this model that you see would be in what 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.769
 what do you think and well, it really is not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.920
 corresponds entirely to reality 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.570
 because this is a model something 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 stereotyped by hollywood in which 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.879
 good as you see, the red color predominates 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.809
 I think it was a film technique 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 to grant more drama and more 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.350
 visibility and that more impact the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.180
 clothing of the soldiers but in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
 reality most historians 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 agree that the Roman soldier 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 he was not wearing clothes dyed in any color 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.450
 that simply his tunic under the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 armor was one color 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.610
 white more or less that was was a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 tunic made of wool and that only 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.640
 officials and senior officials of both 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 army as of the administration and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.460
 powerful people in society would take 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.300
 the tunics dyed red 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 purple or other types but in essence 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the private would be that would be a 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.760
 rather white robe or is not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.800
 would correspond with what you see in the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.350
 image but with what I'm going to put 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.770
 right now 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.310
 and that's pretty funny how 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.740
 cinema has been introducing us is this 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.840
 idea of a Roman soldier in the head that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.229
 it does not fit the story as I have 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.270
 said apart from this in the movies 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 we see that everything is very standardized 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 both armor and weapons and others 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.770
 objects but reality was also a 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 little different, despite the fact that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.800
 produced in a general way the weapons and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.289
 armor and all the equipment as the subject 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.430
 is that according to the province they could vary 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.190
 the designs a little even the soldiers 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 they could buy 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.310
 to old veterans their armor without 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.790
 need to make them an armor 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.160
 new then clear this what gave the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.490
 army would be some differences 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.250
 in terms of designs that really in the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.200
 movies we do not see no but I do not know this I 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.240
 It seemed interesting to make a video 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 clarifying this because even though 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.020
 all this everybody almost all the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.410
 world has that idea in mind 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.600
 as I say it is not 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.850
 adjustable to what was the reality 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.860
 historical and good with this I give for 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.860
 finished in video is has been a video 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.070
 very short but I do not know I hope that you 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.200
 have liked and are not in the future to 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.970
 see if I make any more video of this 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.830
 style and nothing else this has been all 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.490
 thank you very much and see you in the next 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.490
 video a greeting
