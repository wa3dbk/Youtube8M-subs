well this is key because most people
give<00:02:28.610> up<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.879> treatment<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.480> preventative

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
give up the treatment the preventative

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.960 
give up the treatment the preventative
treatments<00:02:30.379> before<00:02:30.980> they<00:02:31.190> see<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.459> results

treatments before they see the results

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.339 
treatments before they see the results
from<00:02:32.090> them<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.480> you've<00:02:32.840> got<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.170> give<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
from them so you've got to give it

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.259 
from them so you've got to give it
months<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:34.099> maybe<00:02:34.370> six<00:02:34.790> months<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.180> you're

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269

average case well hair transplantation
is<00:04:53.250> based<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.729> numbers<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.150> grafts<00:04:54.630> that

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
is based on the numbers of grafts that

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.210 
is based on the numbers of grafts that
you<00:04:54.930> need<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.500> number<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.770> sessions<00:04:55.979> that

you need and the number of sessions that
you<00:04:56.460> need<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.880> hair<00:04:57.090> transplants<00:04:57.449> can<00:04:57.479> be

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
you need so hair transplants can be

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.999 
you need so hair transplants can be
expensive<00:04:58.110> they<00:04:58.169> can<00:04:58.320> run<00:04:58.470> from<00:04:58.620> ten<00:04:58.860> to

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
expensive they can run from ten to

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.650 
expensive they can run from ten to
twenty<00:04:59.130> thousand<00:04:59.610> dollars<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.479> they're

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
twenty thousand dollars but they're

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.990 
twenty thousand dollars but they're
permanent<00:05:01.199> so<00:05:01.800> if<00:05:01.979> you've<00:05:02.160> got<00:05:02.310> hair<00:05:02.550> loss<00:05:02.729> and
