 the ste is that bar anyway 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
 correct to execute 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.329
 bush if it is one of the main 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.719
 workout providers who work 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.019
 this posterior muscle of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 legs then it's we start from the beginning 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.830
 of the person's educational exercises 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 body movement awareness 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.370
 correct a work without initial weight 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.060
 for the moment that it creates 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.580
 awareness it is increasing the weight 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.850
 gradually increases the weight of the bar 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.820
 adds washers and becomes more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.119
 elaborated the exercise to strengthen 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.970
 Even gluteus is difficult to even ask 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.130
 How long have things like this but do you have? 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.080
 that using a little load of accurate 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.280
 have to have a little more 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.470
 how does it work? 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 we start from educational exercises like 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.869
 one of the wall is an educational 12 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 there are others of isometria soil 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.509
 then one of the exercises was that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.990
 shown on the wall and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.360
 gradually the load will be increased 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.030
 because working with weight is very 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.250
 important for the definition of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.130
 musculature the gain of mass to stay 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.239
 the stronger the stronger it is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.480
 everyday 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.910
 when I came back unfortunately not 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 we can work the same a lot every 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.459
 days 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.300
 because there is only one mass gain one 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.370
 muscle building at rest time 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 that's why feeding is so important. 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 correct replacement of protein g 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.660
 post-training, because the boy needs 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 rest 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.489
 so girl 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.489
