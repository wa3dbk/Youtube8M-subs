00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
do these brows now I'm sure it's hard to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.450 
do these brows now I'm sure it's hard to
believe<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:10.620> there<00:00:10.980> are<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.160> different

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
believe but there are two different

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.070 
believe but there are two different
techniques<00:00:11.759> two<00:00:12.090> different<00:00:12.389> products<00:00:12.780> used

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080

on<00:00:13.290> these<00:00:13.469> brows<00:00:13.740> actually<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:14.490> both<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
on these brows actually where both of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.460 
on these brows actually where both of
these<00:00:15.000> brows<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.540> my<00:00:15.660> makeup<00:00:15.870> tutorials<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
these brows in my makeup tutorials I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.380 
these brows in my makeup tutorials I
just<00:00:16.710> transition<00:00:17.220> between<00:00:17.400> one<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> other

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
just transition between one or the other

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
just transition between one or the other
and<00:00:18.660> both<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> front<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.890> both<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> my

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810 
and both of the front on both of my
tutorials<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:22.050> questions<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.800> doing<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> bra

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
a lot I did it in my last tutorial for
my<00:00:48.180> brows<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> wasn't<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.020> clear<00:00:49.649> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
my brows but it wasn't very clear so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.029 
my brows but it wasn't very clear so
what<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> gel<00:00:51.649> pencil

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
what I do is I take a gel pencil

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
what I do is I take a gel pencil
now<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.090> gel<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> move<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
now it's gel because I want to move it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
now it's gel because I want to move it
around<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.800> works<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.820> corners

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
around and it works well on the corners

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
around and it works well on the corners
of<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.780> brows<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.590> sharp<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
of my brows and it's more sharp and so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
of my brows and it's more sharp and so
it<00:00:59.340> works<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.850> adhesive<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.480> leaves

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it works like an adhesive and it leaves

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
it works like an adhesive and it leaves
the<00:01:00.870> hairs<00:01:01.079> down<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.129> over<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> with

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the hairs down so when I go over it with

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.870

and what I first do is I create a line
so<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.300> create<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> line<00:02:25.990> from<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> base<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.770> I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
so I create a line from the base and I

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.150 
so I create a line from the base and I
try<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:27.730> perfect<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:28.840> possible

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
try to get it as perfect as possible

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.830 
try to get it as perfect as possible
create<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> line<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.820> work<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.300> now

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
create a line and kind of work it in now

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.279 

and<00:04:49.979> this<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.660> before<00:04:51.840> and

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
and this is the this is the before and

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.820 
and this is the this is the before and
this<00:04:52.849> is<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:54.000> after<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
this is the after so this is the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.960 
this is the after so this is the
technique<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.400> usually<00:04:56.960> go<00:04:57.960> for<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:02.729> for

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
technique that I usually go for so for

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.070 
technique that I usually go for so for
the<00:05:03.060> second<00:05:03.389> technique<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:04.940> use<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.330> gel<00:05:06.750> now<00:05:07.020> you

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the second technique I use a gel now you

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.490 
the second technique I use a gel now you
can<00:05:07.319> use<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.650> hacia<00:05:08.569> palma<00:05:09.569> nade<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.229> I'm

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
can use the hacia palma nade but I'm

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.490 
can use the hacia palma nade but I'm
just<00:05:10.740> using<00:05:10.979> dip<00:05:11.370> down<00:05:11.580> by<00:05:12.030> Mac<00:05:12.300> it's<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.659> kind

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
just using dip down by Mac it's a kind

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.990 
just using dip down by Mac it's a kind
of<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> same<00:05:13.830> thing<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.190> just<00:05:14.340> dries<00:05:14.550> faster

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
of the same thing it just dries faster

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.029 
of the same thing it just dries faster
so<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.270> got<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.449> be<00:05:15.539> careful<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.080> because<00:05:16.949> it

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
so you got to be careful and because it

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:17.990 
so you got to be careful and because it
dries<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.280> quickly

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
dries so quickly

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.550 
dries so quickly
I<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.210> wetting<00:05:18.569> my<00:05:18.659> brush<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.139> just<00:05:19.169> take<00:05:19.530> a

I like wetting my brush I just take a

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
I like wetting my brush I just take a
little<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:20.930> would<00:05:21.930> not<00:05:22.229> go<00:05:22.409> in<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.039> take<00:05:23.220> some

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
and because this is so strong you need

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.760 
and because this is so strong you need
to<00:05:26.940> buff<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.960> out<00:05:28.139> increase<00:05:28.560> the
