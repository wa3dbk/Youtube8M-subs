14w<00:00:05.040> 42b<00:00:06.020> witches<00:00:07.020> will<00:00:07.319> now<00:00:07.440> spawn<00:00:07.830> under<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
14w 42b witches will now spawn under the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.160 
14w 42b witches will now spawn under the
same<00:00:08.490> conditions<00:00:08.970> as<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.300> other<00:00:09.719> hostile

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
same conditions as the other hostile

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.410 
same conditions as the other hostile
mobs<00:00:10.440> such<00:00:10.710> as<00:00:10.889> Scouts<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.519> scrapers<00:00:11.940> zombies

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
mobs such as Scouts and scrapers zombies

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.740 
mobs such as Scouts and scrapers zombies
spiders<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:14.160> Enderman<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.849> pretty<00:00:15.660> much

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
spiders and Enderman so pretty much

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.210 
spiders and Enderman so pretty much
anywhere<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.470> low<00:00:16.619> enough<00:00:16.830> light<00:00:17.070> low

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
anywhere with a low enough light low

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.390 
anywhere with a low enough light low
light<00:00:17.699> level<00:00:18.109> their<00:00:19.109> spawns<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> lot<00:00:20.220> less

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
light level their spawns are a lot less

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
light level their spawns are a lot less
frequent<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.210> still<00:00:21.420> spawn

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
frequent but they still spawn

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
frequent but they still spawn
nonetheless<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:23.400> those<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.789> that

nonetheless so for those of you that
consider<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:25.080> worth<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> farm<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.410> new

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
consider we're worth it to farm this new

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
consider we're worth it to farm this new
mob<00:00:28.980> spawning<00:00:29.429> system<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> filter

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
mob spawning system I have here a filter

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
mob spawning system I have here a filter
that<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.540> filter<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:33.960> witches<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that will filter out witches and a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
that will filter out witches and a
system<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.880> allows<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> easily<00:00:36.450> kill

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
system that allows you to easily kill

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.520 
system that allows you to easily kill
them<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> looting<00:00:38.340> sword

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
them with a looting sword

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
them with a looting sword
so<00:00:40.530> yeah<00:00:40.680> I'll<00:00:41.059> just<00:00:42.059> show<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.300> guys<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so yeah I'll just show you guys this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.840 
so yeah I'll just show you guys this
here<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.050> let's<00:00:43.559> spawn<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.160> skeletons

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
here so let's spawn in some skeletons

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.569 
here so let's spawn in some skeletons
creepers<00:00:45.739> let's<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:46.980> witches<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> there

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
creepers let's get some witches in there

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.979 
creepers let's get some witches in there
and<00:00:49.039> then<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.070> zombies<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and then some zombies and then the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
and then some zombies and then the
spiders<00:00:54.530> obviously<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.649> theory<00:00:56.030> they<00:00:57.030> fell

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
spiders obviously in theory they fell

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
spiders obviously in theory they fell
but<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.989> theory<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:59.070> through<00:00:59.250> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
but in theory they just go through this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
but in theory they just go through this
little<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> wide<00:01:00.300> slot<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.899> fall<00:01:01.050> down<00:01:01.079> onto

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
little to wide slot and fall down onto

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.420 
little to wide slot and fall down onto
there<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.739> 1.7<00:01:04.739> mob<00:01:04.979> filter

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
there so this is what a a 1.7 mob filter

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
there so this is what a a 1.7 mob filter
might<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.380> anyway<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
might look like anyway so the way I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.429 
might look like anyway so the way I
decided<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.420> best<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> filter<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
decided it was best to filter out the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
decided it was best to filter out the
witches<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> other<00:01:11.189> mobs<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:12.450> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
witches from the other mobs is a by just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.499 
witches from the other mobs is a by just
a<00:01:12.780> stream<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> water<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.030> see<00:01:15.030> witches

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a stream of water here you see witches

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
a stream of water here you see witches
will<00:01:16.470> drink<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> potion<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.189> water<00:01:17.250> breathing

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
will drink a potion of water breathing

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.550 
will drink a potion of water breathing
by<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> way<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.290> added

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
by the way that's also going to be added

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310 
by the way that's also going to be added
in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> 1.7<00:01:20.610> update<00:01:21.030> we'll<00:01:21.689> drink<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> potion

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
in the 1.7 update we'll drink a potion

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
in the 1.7 update we'll drink a potion
of<00:01:22.619> water<00:01:22.680> breathing<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.700> start<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of water breathing when they start to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
of water breathing when they start to
suffer<00:01:24.240> damage<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.880> drowning<00:01:27.200> normal<00:01:28.200> mobs

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
suffer damage from drowning normal mobs

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.520 
suffer damage from drowning normal mobs
obviously<00:01:29.369> however<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.180> die<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
obviously however will just die so this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.460 
obviously however will just die so this
is<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.250> length<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.850> Oh

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
is just the right length here well Oh

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.539 
is just the right length here well Oh
looks<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.310> higher

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
looks like I need to make it one higher

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.390 
looks like I need to make it one higher
home<00:01:36.360> I've<00:01:36.869> tested<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:38.070> half<00:01:38.280> an

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
home I've tested this for about half an

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
home I've tested this for about half an
hour<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.119> non<00:01:39.930> which

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
hour and that's the first non which

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.789 
hour and that's the first non which
month<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> through<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.820> anyways<00:01:42.799> so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
month to make it through well anyways so

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219 
month to make it through well anyways so
that's<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.490> basic<00:01:44.820> theory<00:01:45.060> behind<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that's the basic theory behind this and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
that's the basic theory behind this and
just<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> warn<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.399> guys<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
just to warn you guys if you want to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
just to warn you guys if you want to
make<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.509> yourself<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.170> didn't<00:01:49.829> place

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
make this for yourself I didn't place

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
make this for yourself I didn't place
one<00:01:50.399> water<00:01:50.670> block<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> top<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> place<00:01:51.750> water

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
one water block at the top I place water

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
one water block at the top I place water
individuos<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.890> one<00:01:53.040> block<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.670> there

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
individuos in one block here there there

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
individuos in one block here there there
and<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.720> forth<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:57.590> another<00:01:58.590> way

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and so on and so forth now another way

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.350 
and so on and so forth now another way
that<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.070> could<00:01:59.310> filter<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> witches

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that you could filter out the witches

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.209 
that you could filter out the witches
just<00:02:00.659> let<00:02:00.750> me<00:02:00.810> mention<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.170> quickly<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
just let me mention this quickly is that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.050 
just let me mention this quickly is that
which<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.990> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> fall<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.950> further<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
which is need to fall a lot further to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
which is need to fall a lot further to
die<00:02:06.240> than<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> other<00:02:06.990> mobs<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> water

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
die than the other mobs I like the water

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
die than the other mobs I like the water
system<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.300> moves<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.750> up

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
system just because now it moves them up

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.260 
system just because now it moves them up
on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.500> filter<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.069> brings<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.879> down<00:02:11.910> for

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
on the filter and brings them down for

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.620 
on the filter and brings them down for
the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.860 
the
part<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:14.130> keeps<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.000> witches<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.540> roughly

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
part so it keeps the witches in roughly

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
part so it keeps the witches in roughly
the<00:02:15.960> same<00:02:16.050> proximity<00:02:16.770> as<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.130> filter<00:02:17.490> over

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the same proximity as your filter over

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.210 
the same proximity as your filter over
here<00:02:17.910> when<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> kill<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> killing

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
here when you kill them but the killing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.120 
here when you kill them but the killing
system<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.990> simply<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.260> drop<00:02:22.470> them<00:02:22.650> down<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
system is simply to drop them down and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.100 
system is simply to drop them down and
then<00:02:23.730> while<00:02:24.090> they're<00:02:24.210> still<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:24.660> fairly<00:02:25.080> low

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
then while they're still at fairly low

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.050 
then while they're still at fairly low
health<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.160> hit<00:02:26.490> them<00:02:26.700> with<00:02:26.850> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
health you can just hit them with a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.110 
health you can just hit them with a
looting<00:02:27.390> sword<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> there<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.710> go<00:02:29.030> most<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
looting sword and there you go most of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.790 
looting sword and there you go most of
this<00:02:30.240> loot<00:02:30.480> wasn't<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.140> batch<00:02:31.350> this

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
this loot wasn't from that batch this

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.430 
this loot wasn't from that batch this
was<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.340> other<00:02:32.520> testing<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.150> did<00:02:33.440> slash

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
was from other testing that I did slash

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
was from other testing that I did slash
shoulders<00:02:34.740> take<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:36.210> what's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
shoulders take out of there but what's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.880 
shoulders take out of there but what's
nice<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.570> having<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> system<00:02:37.560> where<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.770> can

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
nice about having a system where you can

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.180 
nice about having a system where you can
kill<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.580> witches<00:02:38.910> with<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.680> looting<00:02:40.680> sword<00:02:40.920> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
kill the witches with a looting sword is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.040 
kill the witches with a looting sword is
that<00:02:41.610> they<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> chance<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.600> drop<00:02:42.750> pre

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that they have a chance to drop pre

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.200 
that they have a chance to drop pre
brewed<00:02:43.320> potions<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:44.040> thought<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> was<00:02:45.090> more

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
brewed potions I thought it was more

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.480 
brewed potions I thought it was more
than<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.420> healing<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.020> apparently<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
than just healing but apparently it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
than just healing but apparently it
looks<00:02:47.520> like<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.910> only<00:02:48.060> healing<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> oh<00:02:51.120> maybe

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
looks like it's only healing so oh maybe

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.910 
looks like it's only healing so oh maybe
it's<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.990> potion<00:02:52.320> they're<00:02:52.440> drinking<00:02:52.650> at

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it's just the potion they're drinking at

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.020 
it's just the potion they're drinking at
the<00:02:53.010> time<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.430> would<00:02:53.490> make<00:02:53.670> sense

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the time that would make sense

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.660 
the time that would make sense
so<00:02:54.560> yes<00:02:55.560> since<00:02:55.800> they're<00:02:55.920> drinking<00:02:56.070> healing

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
so yes since they're drinking healing

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.980 
so yes since they're drinking healing
potions<00:02:57.000> while<00:02:57.210> we<00:02:57.300> kill<00:02:57.480> them<00:02:57.630> now<00:02:57.780> they'll

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
potions while we kill them now they'll

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.620 
potions while we kill them now they'll
drop<00:02:58.320> those<00:02:58.500> potions<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.940> actually<00:03:00.600> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
drop those potions so this is actually a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
drop those potions so this is actually a
way<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.230> lot<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.470> generally<00:03:02.280> thinit

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
way to get a lot of generally thinit

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850 
way to get a lot of generally thinit
resources<00:03:03.510> such<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:03.900> healing<00:03:04.410> potions

redstone so on and so forth obviously
you<00:03:09.090> don't<00:03:09.240> have<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.660> filter<00:03:09.960> them<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.500> do

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
you don't have to filter them out and do

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.860 
you don't have to filter them out and do
this<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.790> pretty<00:03:12.240> much<00:03:12.330> only<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this this is pretty much only if you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.810 
this this is pretty much only if you
consider<00:03:13.050> worth<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> usse<00:03:14.280> looting<00:03:14.700> on

consider worth it to a usse looting on
them<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:16.500> could<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.490> where<00:03:17.820> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
them you could have a just where it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.490 
them you could have a just where it
kills<00:03:18.210> all<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.600> mobs<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.110> then<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> witch

witch at 1/2 heart of health so even

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.830 
witch at 1/2 heart of health so even
when<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.850> witch<00:04:08.970> Falls<00:04:09.240> from<00:04:09.390> all<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.630> way<00:04:09.720> up

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
when the witch Falls from all the way up

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.949 
when the witch Falls from all the way up
there<00:04:10.080> which<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:11.240> 28.5<00:04:12.240> blocks<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:12.810> you're

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
there which is 28.5 blocks if you're

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.020 
there which is 28.5 blocks if you're
wondering<00:04:13.290> what<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.470> magic<00:04:13.800> height<00:04:14.700> number

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
wondering what that magic height number

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.750 
wondering what that magic height number
is<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.390> believe<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.200> 23<00:04:16.799> for<00:04:16.980> normal<00:04:17.280> mobs<00:04:17.459> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
is I believe it's 23 for normal mobs so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.190 
is I believe it's 23 for normal mobs so
you<00:04:17.820> could<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.209> theory<00:04:18.420> sort<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.840> witches<00:04:19.080> out

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
you could in theory sort the witches out

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.280 
you could in theory sort the witches out
with<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.739> way<00:04:19.920> too<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.229> way

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
with that way too but I like it this way

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.690 
with that way too but I like it this way
because<00:04:22.590> now<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.770> can<00:04:22.919> store<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> witches<00:04:23.550> up

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
because now you can store the witches up

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.280 
because now you can store the witches up
you<00:04:23.850> don't<00:04:23.970> have<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.240> continuously

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
you don't have to continuously

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.600 
you don't have to continuously
watch<00:04:25.380> for<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.650> witch<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.950> then<00:04:26.040> hit<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.460> as

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
watch for a witch and then hit it as

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.390 
watch for a witch and then hit it as
soon<00:04:26.730> as<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.970> falls<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:28.230> reason<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.250> you

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
soon as it falls the reason that you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.970 
soon as it falls the reason that you
would<00:04:29.930> make<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> witches<00:04:31.350> fall<00:04:31.560> first<00:04:31.770> is

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
would make the witches fall first is

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.920 
would make the witches fall first is
that<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.460> instead<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:32.970> having<00:04:33.090> tit<00:04:33.450> than<00:04:33.630> three

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
that so instead of having tit than three

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.650 
that so instead of having tit than three
times<00:04:34.080> using<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.160> precious<00:04:36.120> amount<00:04:36.540> of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
times using up the precious amount of

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.450 
times using up the precious amount of
hits<00:04:36.870> on<00:04:36.990> your<00:04:37.110> sword<00:04:37.380> now<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:38.070> just<00:04:38.280> have<00:04:38.400> to

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
hits on your sword now you just have to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.520 
hits on your sword now you just have to
hit<00:04:38.640> them<00:04:38.790> once<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.330> less<00:04:39.930> damage<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.350> your

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
hit them once so less damage to your

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.480 
hit them once so less damage to your
sword<00:04:41.030> all<00:04:42.030> right<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.390> there<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.690> guys<00:04:42.810> go

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
sword all right so there you guys go

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.100 
sword all right so there you guys go
this<00:04:44.490> isn't<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.820> most<00:04:44.970> practical<00:04:45.360> system<00:04:45.870> but

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
this isn't the most practical system but

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.930 
this isn't the most practical system but
it's<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:47.310> obviously<00:04:48.120> better<00:04:48.510> than<00:04:49.700> good<00:04:50.700> it

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
it's it's obviously better than good it

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
it's it's obviously better than good it
gets<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.210> more<00:04:51.240> more<00:04:51.990> drops<00:04:52.320> from<00:04:52.500> the
