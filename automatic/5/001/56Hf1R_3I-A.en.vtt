morning Shepherd's warning but what does
this<00:00:25.740> mean<00:00:25.800> well<00:00:26.760> simply<00:00:27.300> put<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> red<00:00:28.230> sunset

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this mean well simply put a red sunset

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
this mean well simply put a red sunset
means<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.250> likely<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> turn<00:00:29.970> fine<00:00:30.359> whilst<00:00:31.140> a
