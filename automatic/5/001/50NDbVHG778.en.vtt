00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.970 

then<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:54.519> must<00:03:54.550> put<00:03:55.239> some<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.769> top

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
then you must put some of it on the top

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:06.730 
then you must put some of it on the top
of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:58.390> castle

15<00:04:10.400> minutes<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:18.070> think<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.250> now<00:04:19.459> they<00:04:19.820> are

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.750 
15 minutes I think that now they are
ready<00:04:20.209> they<00:04:20.540> have<00:04:21.020> been<00:04:21.260> in<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> oven<00:04:21.650> for<00:04:21.920> 15

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
ready they have been in the oven for 15

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:34.630 
ready they have been in the oven for 15
minutes<00:04:32.320> now<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.560> ready<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:34.460> look

minutes now it's ready and they look

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.420 
minutes now it's ready and they look
tasty<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:36.140> you<00:04:36.200> can<00:04:36.440> serve<00:04:36.680> them<00:04:36.920> in<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.190> plate

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
tasty so you can serve them in a plate
