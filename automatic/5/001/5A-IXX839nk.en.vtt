00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
trying to kill it's not going to happen

trying to kill it's not going to happen
we<00:04:58.550> are<00:04:58.729> definitely<00:04:58.970> designing<00:04:59.419> a<00:04:59.569> new<00:04:59.599> base

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
we are definitely designing a new base

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.659 
we are definitely designing a new base
for<00:05:00.229> the<00:05:00.680> YouTube<00:05:00.979> all-stars<00:05:01.400> but<00:05:01.550> I'm

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
for the YouTube all-stars but I'm

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.089 
for the YouTube all-stars but I'm
waiting<00:05:01.909> till<00:05:02.300> then<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.659> release<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.349> I

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
waiting till then to release it and I

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.040 
waiting till then to release it and I
think<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.400> should<00:05:04.520> work<00:05:04.669> really<00:05:04.969> well<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.479> might

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
think it should work really well I might

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.300 
think it should work really well I might
just<00:05:06.199> choose<00:05:06.409> one<00:05:06.469> that<00:05:06.680> somebody<00:05:07.159> else

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
just choose one that somebody else

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.730 
just choose one that somebody else
already<00:05:07.490> made<00:05:07.819> and<00:05:08.750> not<00:05:09.050> be<00:05:09.229> created<00:05:09.650> this
