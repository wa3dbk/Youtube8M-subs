00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.109
 unexpected start for hockey 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.760
 report agree but coming 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 minutes you'll generally see a lot 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.549
 unexpected hockey players are preparing for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.250
 training in the pool think this is op 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.830
 general physical training but sits 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.050
 you can padla put socks special 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 for spearfishing 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.180
 so boys do not kill each other 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 please ready team 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.280
 drove here such a hockey underwater and all 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 differently and the putters are not exactly putter and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.050
 washers with lead and stuff 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.050
 that no skates under water 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.430
 the task of pushing the puck hall is not 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.650
 adversary 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.730
 Well, power techniques certainly welcomes 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.090
 it's still hacks 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.130
 although the plan is no clicks throws on 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.740
 gate 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.300
 due to the high density of water it is in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.470
 thousand times denser than air it 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.900
 physically impossible as well as drop you 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.000
 it's all there 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.870
 use as they say second hand 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.430
 for some kind of physical impact on 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.760
 rivals but on the body take successful 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.760
 OK 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.920
 overclocking friend's game moment 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.229
 reducing eyes you faced and corps 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.460
 no more than lay out enough 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.140
 dangerous to follow the rules 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 security guys shot come 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 all participants of the underwater match at the very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.409
 the case of the master of sports candidate for 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.049
 underwater hunting 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.539
 such a special teach what they play 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.789
 to maintain the shape of the load under water 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.880
 no less than on ice 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.850
 can compare 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.289
 Well, perhaps with the usual how immediately I 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.280
 seems to be heavier here 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.900
 hoards you are once again denser than air 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.560
 speed guys are trying to develop such 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.940
 like a cyst on a hockey field many 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.250
 play look in protective gloves 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.560
 because something get a stick in 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 Coke fight easier than ever there is one 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.470
 sports tricks can anyone hand 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.470
 keeps under water with dad it too 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.720
 physical form plays a role 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.030
 definitely plus more moment cool 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 drive his eyes I struggle not quite 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.019
 sitting on old days 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 instincts team spirit 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.849
 clearly support each other and this is over 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.799
 water can also shout and 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.799
 warn there are only 4 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.520
 it's clear here 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.710
 power of the fungus flippers can not be hands 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.260
 push away grab pull in the heat 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.750
 when the breath is over there is only 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.459
 only two meters to the gate strip here already 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.180
 without breathing you have to fight to the end 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.550
 we will easily find 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.959
 probably not easy under water for those who 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.959
 could easily walk easily to ice
