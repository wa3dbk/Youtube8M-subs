00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
make it easy for everybody and when I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.340 
make it easy for everybody and when I
started<00:01:09.450> doing<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> started

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
started doing that when I started

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
started doing that when I started
thinking<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.180> run

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
thinking about how how we do we run

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
thinking about how how we do we run
airplanes<00:01:12.720> today<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.530> every

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
airplanes today and what do we do every

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
airplanes today and what do we do every
day<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.549> constant<00:01:15.030> basis<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.170> turn

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
day on a constant basis or do we turn

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.179 
day on a constant basis or do we turn

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.460 
aircraft
you<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.030> unnecessarily<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you know unnecessarily what would it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.060 
you know unnecessarily what would it
look<00:01:19.590> like

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
look like

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.249 
look like
where<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.549> trying<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.030> turn<00:01:21.270> everybody<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.869> if

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
where I'm trying to turn everybody to if

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
where I'm trying to turn everybody to if
they<00:01:22.560> line<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.920> already<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.689> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
they line was already there so it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
they line was already there so it
actually<00:01:25.110> ended<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.380> becoming<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.920> easier

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
actually ended up becoming an easier

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
actually ended up becoming an easier
concept<00:01:26.640> than<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:26.970> thought<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.600> just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
concept than what we thought is we just

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
concept than what we thought is we just
took<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> track<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.159> do

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
took the track get it of what we do

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.510 
took the track get it of what we do
today<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.479> drew<00:01:30.600> lines<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
today and then we drew lines down that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.069 
today and then we drew lines down that
Metroplex<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:32.909> no<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.360> complicated

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
Metroplex is really no more complicated

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:34.969 
Metroplex is really no more complicated
than<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
than that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
than that
we<00:01:35.340> try<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> find<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> best<00:01:36.299> routing<00:01:37.200> that's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
we try to find the best routing that's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
we try to find the best routing that's
where<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.829> built<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> roads<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.939> we

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
where we built the roads that's where we

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
where we built the roads that's where we
built<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> highways<00:01:39.810> basically<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
built the highways basically is to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.730 
built the highways basically is to
follow<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> most<00:01:41.610> optimum<00:01:42.090> route<00:01:42.240> ease<00:01:42.740> we

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
follow the most optimum route ease we

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.810 
follow the most optimum route ease we
need<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.659> operate<00:01:45.659> efficiently<00:01:46.430> we<00:01:47.430> need<00:01:47.610> to

need to operate efficiently we need to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.399 
need to operate efficiently we need to
operate<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> good<00:01:48.750> neighbor<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> the

facilities<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.820> what<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.120> were<00:02:53.420> able<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.690> with

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
facilities of what we were able to with

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.060 
facilities of what we were able to with
our<00:02:54.650> host<00:02:54.980> system<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.270> all<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.540> our<00:02:56.780> work

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
our host system and so all of our work

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.590 
our host system and so all of our work
is<00:02:58.070> kind<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.460> moving<00:02:58.730> further<00:02:59.030> away<00:02:59.300> from<00:02:59.480> the

is kind of moving further away from the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.420 
is kind of moving further away from the
airport<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.410> maybe<00:03:00.620> we<00:03:00.740> do<00:03:01.010> more<00:03:01.220> things

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
airport and so maybe we do more things

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.150 
airport and so maybe we do more things
for<00:03:01.880> Memphis<00:03:02.630> from<00:03:03.020> or<00:03:03.320> Albuquerque<00:03:03.710> from
