00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
comments below possibly maybe I don't

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.479 
comments below possibly maybe I don't
know<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.390> here's<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.739> edition<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.459> I

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
know and here's the other edition that I

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.440 
know and here's the other edition that I
was<00:02:50.670> talking<00:02:50.970> about<00:02:51.030> earlier<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.810> think

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
was talking about earlier I think

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.910 
was talking about earlier I think
but<00:02:54.080> anyways<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:56.690> says<00:02:56.959> guidebook<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.590> that's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
but anyways it says guidebook and that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.619 
but anyways it says guidebook and that's
all<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.099> really<00:02:58.370> know<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:59.239> that's<00:02:59.480> an

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
all I really know because that's an

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.610 
all I really know because that's an
English<00:02:59.989> but<00:03:00.519> I'm<00:03:01.599> guessing<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.930> might<00:03:03.379> get

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
English but I'm guessing it might get

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.380 
English but I'm guessing it might get
like<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:04.120> picture<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.280> entire<00:03:07.280> mansion<00:03:07.640> map

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
like a picture of the entire mansion map

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.559 
like a picture of the entire mansion map
or<00:03:08.660> something<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:10.209> if<00:03:11.209> that's<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
or something like that and if that's the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.120 
or something like that and if that's the
case<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.900> guess<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:12.290> kind<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.500> cool<00:03:12.680> you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
case I guess that's kind of cool you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.990 
case I guess that's kind of cool you
know<00:03:13.250> why<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:15.319> as<00:03:16.160> far<00:03:16.340> as<00:03:16.489> i<00:03:16.580> know<00:03:16.640> this

that that version is at a higher quality
