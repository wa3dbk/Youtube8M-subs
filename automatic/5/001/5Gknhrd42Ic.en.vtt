controller<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.510> probably<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:37.230> had<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.530> now

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
controller I probably have had it now

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
controller I probably have had it now
for<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.370> month<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.180> guess<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
for about a month or so I guess it is a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
for about a month or so I guess it is a
really<00:00:42.360> good<00:00:42.600> controller<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> couple

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
really good controller there's a couple

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
really good controller there's a couple
concerns<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.539> maybe<00:00:45.899> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
concerns I have with it and maybe it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
concerns I have with it and maybe it's
just<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.559> more<00:00:47.340> than<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just me more than what it is the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
just me more than what it is the
controller<00:00:48.420> basically<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.579> points

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
controller basically the good points

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
controller basically the good points
about<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.239> are<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> buttons<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.500> here

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
about it are that the buttons over here

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
about it are that the buttons over here
are<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.699> quick<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> can

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
are really really quick as you can

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
are really really quick as you can
probably<00:00:54.719> hear<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.430> they're<00:00:56.430> hyper

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
probably hear the they're hyper

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
probably hear the they're hyper
sensitive<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> barely<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> touch<00:00:58.230> them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
sensitive you barely had to touch them

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
sensitive you barely had to touch them
and<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.609> want<00:01:00.090> them<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.539> of

and they do what they want them to do of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.039

don't<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.580> I'm<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.729> used

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
don't know it was just that I'm not used

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
don't know it was just that I'm not used
to<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> xbox<00:02:10.110> controller<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.009> has

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to the xbox controller and this one has

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.740 
to the xbox controller and this one has
couple<00:02:11.940> things<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> little<00:02:12.569> bit

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
couple things that are a little bit

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
couple things that are a little bit
worse<00:02:13.319> i'll<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.680> grab<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.010> xbox<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.520> show

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
worse i'll just grab the xbox to show

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.250 
worse i'll just grab the xbox to show
you<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.959> see<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:16.410> are<00:02:18.050> similar<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you as you can see they are similar in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.900 
you as you can see they are similar in
size<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:21.209> kind<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.569> thing<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:23.760> will

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
size and that kind of thing but you will

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.990 
size and that kind of thing but you will
see<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> Xbox<00:02:24.900> button<00:02:25.610> goes<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.880> lot

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
see the Xbox button goes in a lot

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.910 
see the Xbox button goes in a lot
quicker<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.319> bit<00:02:28.530> easier<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
quicker and it's a little bit easier to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.400 
quicker and it's a little bit easier to
press<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> extra<00:02:30.810> length<00:02:31.140> down

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
press and with the extra length down

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.199 
press and with the extra length down
here<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.709> find<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.760> doing<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> little<00:02:33.030> bit

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
here I find I was doing a little bit

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.090 
here I find I was doing a little bit
more<00:02:33.330> button<00:02:33.840> fumbling<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.650> guess<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.950> could

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
more button fumbling I guess you could

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.790 
more button fumbling I guess you could
say<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.180> doing<00:02:36.360> before<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
say them what I was doing before so that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.280 
say them what I was doing before so that
was<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> an<00:02:38.310> issue<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.550> me<00:02:39.290> another

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
was a bit of an issue for me another

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.720 
was a bit of an issue for me another
thing<00:02:40.680> was<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.959> cord<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.810> yes<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:47.459> line

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
thing was the cord that is yes this line

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.990 
thing was the cord that is yes this line
so<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.680> long<00:02:49.950> cord<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.580> does<00:02:50.790> break

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
so it's a really long cord it does break

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.490 
so it's a really long cord it does break
off<00:02:51.209> right<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> end<00:02:51.840> which<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.200> thought<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
off right at the end which I thought it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.840 
off right at the end which I thought it
would<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> better<00:02:52.890> idea<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.730> up

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
would be a better idea to have that up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.220 
would be a better idea to have that up
here<00:02:54.120> somewhere<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.780> mean<00:02:55.019> then<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
here somewhere because I mean then you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
here somewhere because I mean then you
can<00:02:55.350> store<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.950> little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.519> better<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
can store a little bit better but the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300 
can store a little bit better but the
cord<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.330> 15<00:02:57.900> feet<00:02:58.230> long<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.920> quite<00:02:59.069> long

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
cord is 15 feet long that's quite long

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.430 
cord is 15 feet long that's quite long
and<00:02:59.610> i<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.150> enough<00:03:00.510> wires<00:03:00.810> behind<00:03:01.080> me<00:03:01.319> now

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and i have enough wires behind me now

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.020 
and i have enough wires behind me now
that<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.650> had<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.890> deal<00:03:02.069> with<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.910> was

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that I had to deal with so that was

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.530 
that I had to deal with so that was
another<00:03:03.120> issue<00:03:03.450> i<00:03:03.600> had<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:05.970> overall<00:03:06.209> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
another issue i had so but overall you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
another issue i had so but overall you
know<00:03:06.600> i<00:03:06.690> probably<00:03:07.080> give<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.560> seven<00:03:07.860> out<00:03:08.069> of

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
know i probably give it a seven out of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.890 
know i probably give it a seven out of
ten<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.610> remapping<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> buttons<00:03:09.690> some

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
ten the remapping of the buttons some

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.180 
ten the remapping of the buttons some
people<00:03:10.140> will<00:03:10.230> find<00:03:10.440> really<00:03:10.769> really<00:03:11.010> useful

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
people will find really really useful

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.190 
people will find really really useful
but<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.150> me<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.390> didn't<00:03:12.569> particularly<00:03:12.810> solve

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
but for me it didn't particularly solve

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.190 
but for me it didn't particularly solve
the<00:03:13.380> issue<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.890> i<00:03:13.950> wanted<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.360> what<00:03:16.170> I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's a little bit smaller it seems to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.400 
it's a little bit smaller it seems to
fit<00:03:39.209> my<00:03:39.359> hands<00:03:39.630> all<00:03:39.780> over<00:03:39.870> better<00:03:40.170> just<00:03:40.380> a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
fit my hands all over better just a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.840 
fit my hands all over better just a
little<00:03:40.590> bit<00:03:40.680> more<00:03:40.799> used<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> way<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.640> feels

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
little bit more used to the way it feels

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.360 
little bit more used to the way it feels
the<00:03:42.750> top<00:03:43.350> buttons<00:03:43.859> on<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:45.230> ps3<00:03:46.230> are<00:03:46.829> used<00:03:47.130> for

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
the top buttons on the ps3 are used for

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.360 
the top buttons on the ps3 are used for
80s<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.239> foreign<00:03:48.660> your<00:03:48.780> weapon<00:03:49.109> on<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.739> Xbox

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
80s and foreign your weapon on the Xbox

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.470

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
is the right and left trigger button so

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.180 
is the right and left trigger button so
that's<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.019> little<00:03:55.109> bit<00:03:55.350> different<00:03:55.709> for<00:03:55.859> me<00:03:56.010> so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250

button which is a remapping button that
I<00:06:12.640> can<00:06:12.790> change<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.390> way<00:06:13.540> these<00:06:13.780> because<00:06:14.500> the

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
I can change the way these because the

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.320 
I can change the way these because the
default<00:06:15.160> setting<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.580> course<00:06:15.880> will<00:06:16.630> be<00:06:16.660> for

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
default setting of course will be for

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.670 
default setting of course will be for
these<00:06:19.330> buttons<00:06:19.630> to<00:06:19.750> be<00:06:19.810> identical<00:06:20.260> to<00:06:20.410> your

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
these buttons to be identical to your

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.080 
these buttons to be identical to your
xbox<00:06:21.040> controller<00:06:21.400> so<00:06:21.550> what<00:06:21.670> I'm<00:06:21.730> gonna<00:06:21.850> do<00:06:22.000> I'm
