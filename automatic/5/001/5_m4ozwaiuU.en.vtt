creating a basic shrink sleeve dialogue
in<00:00:12.459> Adobe<00:00:13.059> Illustrator<00:00:13.179> and<00:00:13.749> I'm<00:00:14.230> going<00:00:14.379> to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
in Adobe Illustrator and I'm going to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.390 
in Adobe Illustrator and I'm going to
show<00:00:14.619> you<00:00:14.709> how<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:14.919> do<00:00:15.129> that<00:00:15.249> right<00:00:15.610> now

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
show you how to do that right now

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640 
show you how to do that right now
firstly<00:00:18.400> take<00:00:18.670> your<00:00:19.080> illustrator<00:00:20.080> open<00:00:20.440> it<00:00:20.530> up

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
firstly take your illustrator open it up

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.010 
firstly take your illustrator open it up
and<00:00:20.890> create<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:21.340> brand<00:00:21.640> new<00:00:21.700> artwork<00:00:22.240> up<00:00:22.720> board

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
and create a brand new artwork up board

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.140 
and create a brand new artwork up board
as<00:00:23.830> you've<00:00:24.070> got<00:00:24.220> here<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.640> you'll<00:00:24.760> see<00:00:24.970> that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
as you've got here and you'll see that

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.850 
as you've got here and you'll see that
over<00:00:25.300> here<00:00:25.420> in<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.750> layers<00:00:25.900> panel<00:00:26.230> you

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
over here in the layers panel you

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.140 
over here in the layers panel you
probably<00:00:27.220> want<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.460> name<00:00:27.670> that<00:00:27.910> so<00:00:28.090> we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
probably want to name that so we

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.220 
probably want to name that so we
probably<00:00:28.300> want<00:00:28.510> to<00:00:28.600> give<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:28.900> in<00:00:29.020> names

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
probably want to give that in names

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.410 
probably want to give that in names

the<00:00:38.140> layered<00:00:38.350> guide<00:00:38.559> line<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:40.809> pretty<00:00:40.989> much

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
the layered guide line we're pretty much

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.739 
the layered guide line we're pretty much
ready<00:00:41.409> to<00:00:41.469> go<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.699> first<00:00:42.940> things<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.480> we

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
ready to go now the first things that we

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.049 
ready to go now the first things that we
need<00:00:43.960> when<00:00:44.379> we're<00:00:44.589> creating<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.949> die<00:00:45.129> alone<00:00:45.339> as

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
need when we're creating a die alone as

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.079 
need when we're creating a die alone as
we<00:00:46.210> need<00:00:46.359> some<00:00:46.510> measurements<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:48.089> secondary

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
we need some measurements and secondary

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.059 
we need some measurements and secondary
to<00:00:49.239> those<00:00:49.390> measurements<00:00:49.899> it's<00:00:50.530> always<00:00:50.890> nice

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
to those measurements it's always nice

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.319 
to those measurements it's always nice
to<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.429> little<00:00:51.579> bit<00:00:51.729> of<00:00:51.850> an<00:00:51.940> understanding

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
to have a little bit of an understanding

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.040 
to have a little bit of an understanding
about<00:00:53.019> what<00:00:53.469> we're<00:00:53.679> creating<00:00:53.889> shortly<00:00:54.819> for<00:00:55.120> so

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
about what we're creating shortly for so

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.910 
about what we're creating shortly for so
here<00:00:56.229> I<00:00:56.260> have<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.979> 3d<00:00:58.109> mock-up<00:00:59.109> and<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.620> 2d

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
here I have a 3d mock-up and a 2d

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700 
here I have a 3d mock-up and a 2d
mock-up<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.760> actual<00:01:01.149> bottle<00:01:01.449> itself<00:01:01.749> so

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
mock-up of the actual bottle itself so

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.959 
mock-up of the actual bottle itself so
we<00:01:02.829> can<00:01:02.979> actually<00:01:03.100> see<00:01:03.489> what<00:01:03.670> we're<00:01:03.789> working

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
we can actually see what we're working

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.910 
we can actually see what we're working
with<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.540> have<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.930> look<00:01:05.140> at<00:01:05.230> what<00:01:05.379> constraints

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
with and have a look at what constraints

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.110 
with and have a look at what constraints
that<00:01:05.980> we<00:01:06.130> have<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.400> can<00:01:06.520> see<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.820> bottle

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
that we have you can see this bottle

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.700 
that we have you can see this bottle
doesn't<00:01:07.330> straight<00:01:07.690> up<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:07.930> down<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.500> does

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
doesn't straight up and down it does

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.770 
doesn't straight up and down it does
have<00:01:08.920> some<00:01:08.950> curves<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:10.360> little<00:01:10.600> bit<00:01:10.690> of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
have some curves and a little bit of

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.200 
have some curves and a little bit of
shape<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> moment<00:01:12.490> we're<00:01:13.180> just

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
shape to it at the moment we're just

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450 
shape to it at the moment we're just
gonna<00:01:13.450> work<00:01:13.660> with<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.930> dialog<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.220> first

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
gonna work with the dialog so the first

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.010 
gonna work with the dialog so the first
things<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:15.910> have<00:01:16.090> here<00:01:16.360> are<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> cut

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
things that we have here are the cut

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.270 
things that we have here are the cut
length<00:01:17.230> which<00:01:18.010> is<00:01:18.720> 238<00:01:20.040> millimeters<00:01:21.040> and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
length which is 238 millimeters and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.340 
length which is 238 millimeters and
let's<00:01:21.430> our<00:01:21.640> measurement<00:01:22.060> from<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.960> label

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
let's our measurement from the label

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.650 
let's our measurement from the label
bottom<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.640> top<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.000> label<00:01:25.150> that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
bottom to the top of the label that

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.300 
bottom to the top of the label that
doesn't<00:01:26.020> necessarily<00:01:26.140> mean<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.920> measurement

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
doesn't necessarily mean the measurement

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.400 
doesn't necessarily mean the measurement
from<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.580> bottom<00:01:28.120> to<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.660> top<00:01:28.690> of<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.080> bottle

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
from the bottom to the top of the bottle

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.040 
from the bottom to the top of the bottle
it<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.040> just<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> height<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.210> label<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.960> is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
it is just the height of the label it is

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.720 
it is just the height of the label it is
going<00:01:32.260> to<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.380> applied<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.220> bottle<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
going to be applied to the bottle the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.650 
going to be applied to the bottle the
container<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.450> vial<00:01:34.720> whatever<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:35.590> might<00:01:35.770> be

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
container the vial whatever it might be

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.750 
container the vial whatever it might be
secondly<00:01:37.660> we<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.350> lay<00:01:38.560> flat<00:01:38.830> which<00:01:39.730> is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
secondly we have the lay flat which is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.540 
secondly we have the lay flat which is
153<00:01:40.660> millimeters<00:01:41.260> now<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.220> actually<00:01:42.340> a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
153 millimeters now that is actually a

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700 
153 millimeters now that is actually a
measurement<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.540> width<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.320> label

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
measurement of the width of the label

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.820 
measurement of the width of the label
once<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.610> scene<00:01:45.880> has<00:01:46.450> been<00:01:46.660> welded<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.260> it

once it the scene has been welded and it

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.790 
once it the scene has been welded and it
and<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.220> label<00:01:48.490> has<00:01:48.580> been<00:01:48.610> followed<00:01:49.650> so<00:01:50.650> it's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
and the label has been followed so it's

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.630 
and the label has been followed so it's
basically<00:01:51.160> half<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.730> label<00:01:53.430> beyond<00:01:54.430> that

basically half of the label beyond that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.910 
basically half of the label beyond that

manufacturer everyone has different

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.990 
manufacturer everyone has different
specifications<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.160> always<00:02:12.370> crucial<00:02:12.730> to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
specifications so it's always crucial to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.800 
specifications so it's always crucial to
ask

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
ask

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.100 
ask
what<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.380> same<00:02:14.560> dimensions<00:02:15.130> are<00:02:15.459> each<00:02:16.239> sleeve

we're<00:02:21.489> gonna<00:02:21.580> start<00:02:21.880> by<00:02:21.970> creating<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.450> tie<00:02:22.599> line

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
we're gonna start by creating a tie line

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270 
we're gonna start by creating a tie line
now<00:02:22.900> first<00:02:23.140> thing<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.349> want<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.650> jump<00:02:24.160> into

now first thing you want to jump into

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.339 
now first thing you want to jump into
our<00:02:24.520> color<00:02:24.940> swatch<00:02:25.239> here<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.080> want<00:02:26.290> to

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
our color swatch here we just want to

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.660 
our color swatch here we just want to
choose<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.800> color<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.190> nice<00:02:27.459> and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
choose a color that's nice and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
need to be too dark just enough so we

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.839 
need to be too dark just enough so we
can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.709> whiteboard<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:33.790> I'm

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
can see it on the whiteboard here so I'm

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.000 
can see it on the whiteboard here so I'm
just<00:02:34.000> gonna<00:02:34.090> select<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.660> go<00:02:35.349> ahead<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.800> select

just gonna select it go ahead and select
agree<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.870> pretty<00:02:38.290> good<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.680> should<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:38.920> able

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
agree it's pretty good we should be able

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.699 
agree it's pretty good we should be able
to<00:02:39.069> see<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.340> nice<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.730> clean<00:02:40.290> now<00:02:41.290> secondly

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.880 
here in the illustrator tool panel here
we're<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:49.930> gonna<00:02:50.110> click<00:02:50.350> in<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.560> middle<00:02:50.799> of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
we're just gonna click in the middle of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.530 
we're just gonna click in the middle of
our<00:02:51.040> white<00:02:51.549> space<00:02:51.850> here<00:02:51.880> we're<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.450> gonna

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
our white space here we're just gonna

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.720 
our white space here we're just gonna
double<00:02:52.840> tap<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.069> gonna<00:02:54.220> bring<00:02:54.430> up<00:02:54.549> our

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
double tap which is gonna bring up our

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.110 
double tap which is gonna bring up our
rectangle<00:02:56.160> options<00:02:57.160> box<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.940> where

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
rectangle options box and we can where

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.180 
rectangle options box and we can where
we<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.390> set<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.959> dimensions<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.680> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
we can set the dimensions of the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.130 
we can set the dimensions of the
rectangle<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:01.450> probably<00:03:01.630> want<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.930> start

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
rectangle and we probably want to start

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.570 
rectangle and we probably want to start
with<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> height<00:03:02.590> because<00:03:02.890> that's<00:03:03.430> an

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
with the height because that's an

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.550 
with the height because that's an
approximate<00:03:04.120> number<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:05.049> we<00:03:05.140> have<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> couple

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
approximate number so we have a couple

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.470 
approximate number so we have a couple
eggs<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.830> 238<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.610> know<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.000> not<00:03:07.120> gonna<00:03:07.299> go

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
eggs of 238 we know it's not gonna go

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.479 
eggs of 238 we know it's not gonna go
anywhere<00:03:07.780> inside<00:03:08.709> or<00:03:08.860> outside<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.370> that

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
anywhere inside or outside of that

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.289 
anywhere inside or outside of that
number<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.870> let's<00:03:11.019> just<00:03:11.370> check<00:03:12.370> down<00:03:12.430> at<00:03:12.790> 238

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
number so let's just check down at 238

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.289 
number so let's just check down at 238
millimeters<00:03:14.610> now<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.670> come<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.090> tricky

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
millimeters now we come to the tricky

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.229 
millimeters now we come to the tricky
part<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.590> width<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.250> working<00:03:18.640> out<00:03:18.730> what<00:03:19.000> our

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
part the width and working out what our

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.410 
part the width and working out what our
actual<00:03:19.570> total<00:03:20.049> width<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.739> for<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.370> label<00:03:21.730> now

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
actual total width is for the label now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.000 
actual total width is for the label now
the<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.810> do<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.320> we<00:03:23.500> take<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.859> lay

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
the way we do that is we take the lay

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.520 
the way we do that is we take the lay
flat<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.359> times<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.780> by<00:03:25.930> 2<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:29.170> create

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
flat and we times that by 2 to create

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.160 
flat and we times that by 2 to create
the<00:03:30.489> full<00:03:30.730> made<00:03:30.970> width<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:32.489> 153<00:03:33.489> times<00:03:33.790> 2<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.569> my

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
the full made width so 153 times 2 in my

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.520 
the full made width so 153 times 2 in my
hand<00:03:35.440> very<00:03:35.530> quickly<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:36.359> 306<00:03:37.359> now<00:03:38.200> one<00:03:38.350> thing

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
hand very quickly is 306 now one thing

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.110 
hand very quickly is 306 now one thing
we<00:03:38.620> also<00:03:38.769> need<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> consider<00:03:39.280> here<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
we also need to consider here is the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.309 
we also need to consider here is the
same<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.720> where<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.079> same

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
same and this is where the same

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.379 
same and this is where the same
measurements<00:03:41.829> become<00:03:42.100> very<00:03:42.370> important<00:03:42.850> we've

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
measurements become very important we've

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.090 
measurements become very important we've
got<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> scene<00:03:43.810> here<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.139> 6<00:03:44.380> millimeters<00:03:44.889> so<00:03:45.010> we

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
got a scene here of 6 millimeters so we

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.979 
got a scene here of 6 millimeters so we
also<00:03:45.340> need<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:45.760> apply<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.269> in<00:03:46.660> order<00:03:46.959> to

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
also need to apply that in order to

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.809 
also need to apply that in order to
create<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.470> basic<00:03:47.859> timeline<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:48.670> I'm<00:03:48.730> gonna

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
create this basic timeline so I'm gonna

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.780 
create this basic timeline so I'm gonna
go<00:03:49.000> ahead<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.180> add<00:03:49.389> that<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.470> top<00:03:50.790> 312

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
go ahead and add that to the top 312

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.280 
go ahead and add that to the top 312
click<00:03:52.630> OK

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
click OK

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
great illustrator has now produced us

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.809 
great illustrator has now produced us
with<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.109> beautiful<00:03:57.069> rectangle<00:03:57.609> that<00:03:57.700> we

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
with this beautiful rectangle that we

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.360 
with this beautiful rectangle that we
have<00:03:58.030> which<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.630> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.170> base<00:03:59.380> about

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
have which is going to be the base about

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.660 
have which is going to be the base about
basic<00:04:00.760> shrink<00:04:01.209> sleeve<00:04:01.299> down<00:04:01.600> line<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.430> as<00:04:03.579> you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
basic shrink sleeve down line and as you

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.559 
basic shrink sleeve down line and as you
can<00:04:03.760> see<00:04:04.000> if<00:04:04.150> we<00:04:04.329> move<00:04:05.079> this<00:04:05.440> over<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.569> side

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
can see if we move this over to the side

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.240 
can see if we move this over to the side
of<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.780> bottles<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.380> gives<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.799> bit<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.069> an

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
of the bottles it gives you a bit of an

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.879 
of the bottles it gives you a bit of an
idea<00:04:09.400> about<00:04:09.850> where<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.329> dye<00:04:11.079> line<00:04:11.319> here<00:04:11.709> and

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
idea about where the dye line here and

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.979 
idea about where the dye line here and
with<00:04:12.400> what<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.940> label<00:04:13.299> dimensions<00:04:13.810> are

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
with what the label dimensions are

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.289 
with what the label dimensions are
against<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.980> container<00:04:15.400> or<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.850> bottle<00:04:16.180> that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
against the container or the bottle that

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.849 
against the container or the bottle that
you're<00:04:16.389> going<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.539> be<00:04:16.660> working<00:04:16.840> with<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.739> can

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
you're going to be working with you can

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.069 
you're going to be working with you can
see<00:04:18.070> how<00:04:18.220> far<00:04:18.430> up<00:04:18.579> taking<00:04:18.910> into<00:04:19.090> account<00:04:19.120> this

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
see how far up taking into account this

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.480 
see how far up taking into account this
will<00:04:20.289> actually<00:04:20.680> shrink<00:04:21.900> down<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.260> what<00:04:24.250> ways

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
will actually shrink down in what ways

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.910 
will actually shrink down in what ways
so<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.330> may<00:04:25.539> not<00:04:25.690> necessarily<00:04:25.750> finish<00:04:26.590> over

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
so it may not necessarily finish over

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.740 
so it may not necessarily finish over
cap<00:04:27.100> here<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.670> it's<00:04:27.880> likely<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.330> were<00:04:28.630> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
cap here and it's likely that were the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.330 
cap here and it's likely that were the
dimensions<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.290> you've<00:04:29.470> got<00:04:29.710> they<00:04:30.130> have

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
dimensions that you've got they have

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.520 
dimensions that you've got they have
been<00:04:30.550> pre-tested<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.450> we'll<00:04:32.020> find<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.410> it

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
been pre-tested and we'll find that it

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.900 
been pre-tested and we'll find that it
will<00:04:32.620> probably<00:04:32.770> end<00:04:33.010> up<00:04:33.130> shrinking<00:04:33.550> just

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
will probably end up shrinking just

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.120 
will probably end up shrinking just
below<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.840> base<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.350> neck<00:04:35.560> which<00:04:35.980> is

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
below the base of the neck which is

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
below the base of the neck which is
where<00:04:36.280> most<00:04:36.610> shrink<00:04:37.150> sleeves<00:04:37.390> will<00:04:37.750> shrink<00:04:38.440> to

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
where most shrink sleeves will shrink to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.900 
where most shrink sleeves will shrink to
sew<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.720> next<00:04:40.930> phase<00:04:41.670> now<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.820> we've

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
sew on to the next phase now that we've

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.930 
sew on to the next phase now that we've
got<00:04:43.090> our<00:04:43.270> total<00:04:44.200> element<00:04:45.010> artboard<00:04:45.460> here<00:04:45.640> or

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
got our total element artboard here or

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.720 
got our total element artboard here or
workspace<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:47.380> can<00:04:47.530> look<00:04:47.680> at<00:04:47.860> creating<00:04:48.460> the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
workspace we can look at creating the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.180 
workspace we can look at creating the
actual<00:04:49.570> clear<00:04:49.990> space<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.500> label<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.980> work

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
actual clear space of the label to work

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.640 
actual clear space of the label to work
out<00:04:51.400> where<00:04:52.030> our<00:04:52.060> art<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.810> going<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.140> be<00:04:53.290> once<00:04:53.560> we

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
out where our art is going to be once we

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.400 
out where our art is going to be once we
start<00:04:53.980> creating<00:04:54.930> once<00:04:55.930> we<00:04:56.050> start<00:04:56.290> designing

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
start creating once we start designing

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.070 
start creating once we start designing
so<00:04:57.130> we're<00:04:57.250> just<00:04:57.280> gonna<00:04:57.430> copy<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.120> paste<00:04:58.870> in

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
so we're just gonna copy and paste in

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.530 
so we're just gonna copy and paste in
front<00:04:59.640> for<00:05:00.640> those<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:00.940> want<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.210> know<00:05:01.330> that's

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
front for those that want to know that's

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.020 
front for those that want to know that's
command<00:05:01.840> C<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.110> copy<00:05:02.260> command<00:05:03.250> F<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.670> paste<00:05:03.880> in

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
command C to copy command F to paste in

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.360 
command C to copy command F to paste in
front<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:05.410> we<00:05:05.500> should<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.890> an<00:05:06.040> element

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
front and we should have an element

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.130 
front and we should have an element
another<00:05:06.880> element<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.570> top<00:05:07.780> you<00:05:07.930> know<00:05:07.960> I'm<00:05:08.080> just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
another element on top you know I'm just

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.200 
another element on top you know I'm just
going<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.350> make<00:05:08.500> sure<00:05:08.530> by<00:05:09.460> clicking<00:05:09.850> ctrl

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
going to make sure by clicking ctrl

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.120 
going to make sure by clicking ctrl
clicking<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.230> mouse<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.710> bringing<00:05:12.070> it

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
clicking on a mouse and bringing it

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.650 
clicking on a mouse and bringing it
element<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.730> front<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.150> ensure<00:05:13.510> that

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
element to the front to ensure that

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.030 
element to the front to ensure that
their<00:05:13.810> element<00:05:14.170> is<00:05:14.260> definitely<00:05:14.620> on<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.770> front

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
their element is definitely on the front

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.630 
their element is definitely on the front
I'll<00:05:15.880> also<00:05:16.290> change<00:05:17.290> their<00:05:17.650> color<00:05:17.950> doesn't

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
I'll also change their color doesn't

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.040 
I'll also change their color doesn't
really<00:05:18.790> matter<00:05:19.120> what<00:05:19.300> color<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.570> is<00:05:19.750> but<00:05:20.020> just

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
really matter what color it is but just

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.450 
really matter what color it is but just
something<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.680> not<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.980> same<00:05:21.190> as<00:05:21.370> what

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
something that is not the same as what

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.250 
something that is not the same as what
you've<00:05:21.640> used<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.450> now<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.660> can<00:05:22.810> see<00:05:22.990> I've<00:05:23.140> got

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
you've used so now you can see I've got

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.040 
you've used so now you can see I've got
two<00:05:23.470> colors<00:05:23.740> there<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.570> one<00:05:25.570> on<00:05:25.720> top<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:25.900> the

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
two colors there and one on top of the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.470 
two colors there and one on top of the
other<00:05:26.170> so<00:05:26.610> I'll<00:05:27.610> be<00:05:27.730> able<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:27.940> see<00:05:28.060> once<00:05:28.330> I

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
other so I'll be able to see once I

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.530 
other so I'll be able to see once I
start<00:05:28.750> making<00:05:28.870> adjustments<00:05:30.330> okay<00:05:31.330> now<00:05:31.480> to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
start making adjustments okay now to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.150 
start making adjustments okay now to
start<00:05:31.810> creating<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.260> clear<00:05:32.470> space<00:05:32.710> we<00:05:32.980> want

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
start creating the clear space we want

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.330 
start creating the clear space we want
to<00:05:33.220> bring<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.760> our<00:05:33.790> transform<00:05:34.540> panel<00:05:34.900> over<00:05:35.470> we

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
to bring in our transform panel over we

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.240 
to bring in our transform panel over we
can<00:05:36.490> see<00:05:36.720> here<00:05:37.720> is<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> transformation<00:05:38.650> box<00:05:38.890> you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
can see here is a transformation box you

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.250 
can see here is a transformation box you
can<00:05:39.400> see<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.760> leading<00:05:39.940> corners<00:05:40.390> leading

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
can see the leading corners leading

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.430 
can see the leading corners leading
edges<00:05:41.560> in<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:42.790> little<00:05:43.030> widget<00:05:43.210> here<00:05:43.540> we<00:05:44.230> want

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
edges in this little widget here we want

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.110 
edges in this little widget here we want
to<00:05:44.530> adjust<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.100> width<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.610> height<00:05:45.640> of

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
to adjust the width and the height of

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.330 
to adjust the width and the height of
the<00:05:46.630> object<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:47.050> we<00:05:47.230> have<00:05:47.350> selected<00:05:47.920> which

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
the object that we have selected which

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.550 
the object that we have selected which
is<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.580> one<00:05:48.730> we've<00:05:48.910> changed<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.300> color<00:05:49.540> of<00:05:49.720> so

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
is the one we've changed the color of so

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.170 
is the one we've changed the color of so
really<00:05:51.070> we<00:05:51.190> want<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.430> start<00:05:51.700> with<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:51.910> same

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
really we want to start with the same

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.060 
really we want to start with the same
fist<00:05:52.540> and<00:05:53.200> we're<00:05:53.350> probably<00:05:53.740> need<00:05:53.980> to

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
fist and we're probably need to

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.440 
fist and we're probably need to
understand<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.700> difference<00:05:55.030> between<00:05:55.090> this

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
understand the difference between this

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.730 
understand the difference between this
scene<00:05:55.720> because<00:05:56.050> we're<00:05:56.170> gonna<00:05:56.260> have<00:05:56.440> six

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
scene because we're gonna have six

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.400 
scene because we're gonna have six
millimeter<00:05:57.220> millimeters<00:05:58.150> but<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.050> will<00:05:59.230> be

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
millimeter millimeters but it will be

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.200 
millimeter millimeters but it will be
broken<00:05:59.620> down<00:05:59.890> and<00:06:00.130> what<00:06:00.250> we<00:06:00.370> require<00:06:00.730> is<00:06:00.940> six

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
broken down and what we require is six

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.570 
broken down and what we require is six
month<00:06:01.510> five<00:06:01.900> millimeters<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.830> right<00:06:03.370> hand

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
month five millimeters on the right hand

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.360 
month five millimeters on the right hand
side<00:06:03.940> to<00:06:04.210> be<00:06:04.660> taken<00:06:05.050> away<00:06:05.290> so<00:06:06.130> we're<00:06:06.280> gonna

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
side to be taken away so we're gonna

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
side to be taken away so we're gonna
select<00:06:06.670> the<00:06:07.240> left<00:06:07.510> because<00:06:07.840> we<00:06:07.960> want<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.290> pull

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
select the left because we want to pull

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.660 
select the left because we want to pull
this<00:06:11.580> point<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:13.450> the<00:06:13.570> left<00:06:13.810> by<00:06:14.620> six<00:06:14.980> melon<00:06:15.370> way

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
this point to the left by six melon way

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.710 
this point to the left by six melon way
you<00:06:15.730> do<00:06:15.910> that<00:06:16.030> is<00:06:16.180> by<00:06:16.380> selecting<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:18.280> node

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
you do that is by selecting the node

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.450 
you do that is by selecting the node
jumping<00:06:19.720> into<00:06:19.840> with<00:06:20.140> box<00:06:20.410> and<00:06:20.740> then<00:06:20.980> selecting

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
jumping into with box and then selecting

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.660 
jumping into with box and then selecting
-5<00:06:22.500> you<00:06:23.500> can<00:06:23.650> see<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:23.980> this<00:06:24.100> point<00:06:24.340> has<00:06:24.520> now

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
-5 you can see that this point has now

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.340 
-5 you can see that this point has now
moved<00:06:24.910> backwards<00:06:25.360> five<00:06:25.570> millimeters<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.260> the

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
moved backwards five millimeters to the

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.740 
moved backwards five millimeters to the
left<00:06:26.590> when<00:06:26.800> we<00:06:26.920> select<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.310> left<00:06:27.730> node<00:06:27.940> is

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
left when we select the left node is

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.090 
left when we select the left node is
perfect<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:31.030> we<00:06:31.300> need<00:06:31.450> to<00:06:31.570> add<00:06:31.750> one<00:06:32.290> melon<00:06:32.620> -

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
perfect and we need to add one melon -

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.250 
perfect and we need to add one melon -
one<00:06:33.730> millimeter<00:06:34.150> off<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.450> left<00:06:34.630> hand<00:06:34.870> side<00:06:35.050> so

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
one millimeter off the left hand side so

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.480 
one millimeter off the left hand side so
we'll<00:06:35.410> select<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.800> right<00:06:36.040> because<00:06:36.220> we<00:06:36.400> want

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
we'll select the right because we want

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.189 
we'll select the right because we want
it<00:06:36.640> to<00:06:36.700> fall<00:06:36.850> to<00:06:37.000> the<00:06:37.120> right

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
it to fall to the right

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.730 
it to fall to the right
and<00:06:38.469> will<00:06:38.650> -<00:06:39.039> one<00:06:39.990> begin<00:06:40.990> making<00:06:41.289> sure<00:06:41.590> that

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
and will - one begin making sure that

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.580 
and will - one begin making sure that
you<00:06:41.860> haven't<00:06:42.099> switched<00:06:42.430> your<00:06:43.409> linking<00:06:44.409> there

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
you haven't switched your linking there

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.629 
you haven't switched your linking there
so<00:06:44.889> that<00:06:45.009> you're<00:06:45.129> not<00:06:45.219> constraining

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
so that you're not constraining

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.619 
so that you're not constraining
properties<00:06:46.060> because<00:06:46.330> they're<00:06:46.479> all<00:06:46.599> really

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
properties because they're all really

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.249 
properties because they're all really
muck<00:06:47.229> things<00:06:47.379> out<00:06:47.620> for<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:48.900> right<00:06:49.900> so<00:06:50.139> that's

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
muck things out for you right so that's

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.469 
muck things out for you right so that's
basically<00:06:50.770> our<00:06:50.889> clear<00:06:51.520> seam<00:06:51.789> left<00:06:52.150> and<00:06:52.330> right

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
basically our clear seam left and right

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.200 
basically our clear seam left and right
sorted<00:06:52.840> out<00:06:52.960> and<00:06:53.169> now<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:53.949> cut<00:06:54.279> length<00:06:54.520> of<00:06:54.789> 238

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
sorted out and now the cut length of 238

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.200 
sorted out and now the cut length of 238
we<00:06:55.479> need<00:06:55.629> to<00:06:55.719> -<00:06:55.900> our<00:06:56.889> clear<00:06:57.219> top<00:06:57.610> and<00:06:57.789> bottom<00:06:58.060> of

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
we need to - our clear top and bottom of

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.659 
we need to - our clear top and bottom of
our<00:06:58.539> material<00:06:59.139> so<00:06:59.949> what<00:07:00.039> we<00:07:00.159> can<00:07:00.279> do<00:07:00.460> is<00:07:00.550> we

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
our material so what we can do is we

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.279 
our material so what we can do is we
want<00:07:00.849> to<00:07:00.879> go<00:07:01.060> to<00:07:01.120> the<00:07:01.360> click<00:07:01.689> on<00:07:01.779> our<00:07:01.930> center

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
want to go to the click on our center

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.689 
want to go to the click on our center
node<00:07:02.469> because<00:07:02.830> we're<00:07:02.979> pulling<00:07:03.310> top<00:07:03.550> and

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:03.699 
node because we're pulling top and

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.779 
node because we're pulling top and
bottom<00:07:04.319> in<00:07:05.319> most<00:07:05.830> cases<00:07:06.069> that's<00:07:06.370> going<00:07:06.580> to<00:07:06.669> be

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
bottom in most cases that's going to be

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.820 
bottom in most cases that's going to be
two<00:07:06.969> millimeters<00:07:07.509> of<00:07:07.779> clear<00:07:08.050> top<00:07:08.349> and<00:07:08.560> bottom

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
two millimeters of clear top and bottom

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.939 
two millimeters of clear top and bottom
in<00:07:09.039> most<00:07:09.580> cases<00:07:10.199> and<00:07:11.199> definitely<00:07:11.710> in<00:07:11.830> this

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
in most cases and definitely in this

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.469 
in most cases and definitely in this
furthest<00:07:12.370> exercise<00:07:12.849> it's<00:07:13.060> going<00:07:13.210> to<00:07:13.270> be<00:07:13.330> two

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 
furthest exercise it's going to be two

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.149 
furthest exercise it's going to be two
millimeters<00:07:13.930> so<00:07:14.529> we're<00:07:14.650> just<00:07:14.680> going<00:07:14.889> to<00:07:14.949> go<00:07:15.039> in

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
millimeters so we're just going to go in

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.300 
millimeters so we're just going to go in
height<00:07:15.400> and<00:07:16.240> we<00:07:16.539> got<00:07:16.689> a<00:07:16.719> tip<00:07:16.960> through<00:07:17.139> here<00:07:17.310> we

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
height and we got a tip through here we

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.159 
height and we got a tip through here we
get<00:07:18.430> a<00:07:18.460> minus<00:07:18.729> four<00:07:19.330> because<00:07:19.629> we<00:07:19.750> need<00:07:19.870> to<00:07:20.080> at

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
get a minus four because we need to at

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.679 
get a minus four because we need to at
the<00:07:20.259> bottom<00:07:20.439> until<00:07:20.860> at<00:07:21.159> the<00:07:21.219> top<00:07:21.629> total<00:07:22.629> of

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689 
the bottom until at the top total of

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.719 
the bottom until at the top total of
four<00:07:22.930> and<00:07:23.560> you<00:07:23.680> can<00:07:23.800> see<00:07:24.009> now<00:07:24.279> that<00:07:24.310> we<00:07:24.580> can

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 
four and you can see now that we can

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.369 
four and you can see now that we can
actually<00:07:24.849> see<00:07:25.210> with<00:07:25.810> the<00:07:25.930> gray<00:07:26.169> in<00:07:26.289> the

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379 
actually see with the gray in the

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.490 
actually see with the gray in the
background<00:07:26.409> they're<00:07:27.300> exactly<00:07:28.300> where<00:07:28.599> our

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
background they're exactly where our

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.529 
background they're exactly where our
clear<00:07:29.770> space<00:07:30.009> is<00:07:30.189> going<00:07:30.370> to<00:07:30.460> be<00:07:30.550> now<00:07:31.479> the

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
clear space is going to be now the

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.510 
clear space is going to be now the
easiest<00:07:31.900> and<00:07:32.139> quickest<00:07:32.439> way<00:07:32.469> to<00:07:32.589> do<00:07:32.800> this<00:07:32.949> is

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 
easiest and quickest way to do this is

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.450 
easiest and quickest way to do this is
to<00:07:33.729> select<00:07:34.029> the<00:07:34.210> top<00:07:34.419> layer<00:07:34.449> and<00:07:35.129> just<00:07:36.129> make<00:07:36.310> it

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
to select the top layer and just make it

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.719 
to select the top layer and just make it
one<00:07:36.960> group<00:07:37.960> these<00:07:38.080> two<00:07:38.259> objects<00:07:38.589> together<00:07:38.740> and

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729 
one group these two objects together and

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:41.550 
one group these two objects together and
there<00:07:39.849> we<00:07:39.939> have<00:07:40.060> it<00:07:40.180> the<00:07:40.839> white<00:07:41.050> space<00:07:41.289> in<00:07:41.469> the

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
there we have it the white space in the

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.809 
there we have it the white space in the
center<00:07:41.830> there<00:07:41.949> is<00:07:42.069> going<00:07:42.310> to<00:07:42.370> be<00:07:42.490> where<00:07:42.639> we're

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:42.819 
center there is going to be where we're

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.399 
center there is going to be where we're
going<00:07:42.939> to<00:07:43.000> apply<00:07:43.210> our<00:07:43.300> artwork<00:07:43.810> in<00:07:43.990> our<00:07:44.080> design

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:44.409 
going to apply our artwork in our design

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.219 
going to apply our artwork in our design
and<00:07:45.339> the<00:07:45.460> gray<00:07:45.669> on<00:07:45.699> the<00:07:45.879> external<00:07:46.509> area<00:07:46.990> here

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:47.229 
and the gray on the external area here

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.860 
and the gray on the external area here
is<00:07:47.830> he<00:07:47.979> actually<00:07:48.099> going<00:07:48.370> to<00:07:48.490> be<00:07:48.610> clear<00:07:48.909> we<00:07:49.750> can

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.870 
is he actually going to be clear we can

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.170 
is he actually going to be clear we can
identify<00:07:50.020> we<00:07:50.529> can<00:07:50.680> now<00:07:50.830> identify<00:07:50.860> a<00:07:51.669> proper
