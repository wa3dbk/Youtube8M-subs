00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.670

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 awesome function called on the nose

 she alarm clock icon that we can here 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 do we can set a timer for 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
 disable playback of the current station 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.480
 that is, for example, we can choose 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280
 that in 4 minutes the data 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 the station will shut down that is if you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.330
 like before bed like to listen 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 music and also there is another killer 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.860
 features we can set the alarm for 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.049

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.810
 you get up at 7 am by the way you are very 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.819
 envy it seems 550 here and we can 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.860
 enable that all morning will play 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.379
 certain station in our case it is 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.360
 dj fm but immediately developer us 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.549
 warns that if suddenly the station 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.660
 for some reason it is not available for you 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.640

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.470
 awesome done very nicely long ago and 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.329
 I have not seen these in the appstore 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.910
 the only negative is that it is not up to 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.310
 The end is adapted for ios 8 but I think 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.940
 what are the developers trowel and beyond that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.069
