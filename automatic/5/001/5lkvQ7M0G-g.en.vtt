00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
what you name it of course but I'm just

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.080 
what you name it of course but I'm just
doing<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.780> for<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:13.960> sake<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.350> video<00:04:15.090> so

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
doing that for the sake of the video so

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.550 
doing that for the sake of the video so
let's<00:04:16.120> create<00:04:16.420> world<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:17.020> probably<00:04:17.140> be<00:04:17.410> kind

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
let's create world it's probably be kind

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.440 
let's create world it's probably be kind
of<00:04:17.650> laggy<00:04:17.800> because<00:04:18.220> Camtasia<00:04:18.610> records<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.270> in

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
of laggy because Camtasia records it in

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.950 
of laggy because Camtasia records it in
less<00:04:19.810> than<00:04:20.050> 60<00:04:20.530> frames<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:20.950> believe<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:22.150> we'll

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
less than 60 frames I believe but we'll

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.300 
less than 60 frames I believe but we'll
see<00:04:24.120> there<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.270> go<00:04:25.450> loading<00:04:25.960> up<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.040> bit

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
see there we go loading up it is a bit

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.370 
see there we go loading up it is a bit
laggy<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:27.760> you're<00:04:28.660> gonna<00:04:28.780> get<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.110> main<00:04:29.260> idea

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
laggy but you're gonna get the main idea

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.440 
laggy but you're gonna get the main idea
of<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.740> I'm<00:04:30.610> going<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.820> go<00:04:30.910> into<00:04:31.030> creative

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
of this I'm going to go into creative

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.320 
of this I'm going to go into creative
and<00:04:31.780> look<00:04:32.230> for<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.500> piston<00:04:33.130> all<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.060> there

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
and look for a piston all right there

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.810 
and look for a piston all right there
you<00:04:34.360> go<00:04:34.450> so<00:04:35.020> we<00:04:35.170> have<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.590> normal<00:04:35.920> pistons<00:04:36.280> and

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
you go so we have the normal pistons and

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.370 
you go so we have the normal pistons and
we<00:04:36.940> have<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> doubles<00:04:37.600> or<00:04:37.840> triples<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.290> the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
we have the doubles or triples and the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.620 
we have the doubles or triples and the
quadruples<00:04:38.890> we<00:04:39.400> also<00:04:39.580> have<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.880> gravitational

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
quadruples we also have a gravitational

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.650 
quadruples we also have a gravitational
piston<00:04:40.960> these<00:04:41.140> things<00:04:41.350> are<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:41.710> cool<00:04:41.950> because

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
piston these things are so cool because

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.600 
piston these things are so cool because
i'll<00:04:43.660> show<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.220> if<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.370> can<00:04:45.640> do<00:04:45.790> this<00:04:45.820> correctly

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
i'll show you if I can do this correctly

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.820 
i'll show you if I can do this correctly
actually<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.820> don't<00:04:49.330> want<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.660> do<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:49.930> here

like<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.220> let's<00:04:51.730> do<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.990> can<00:04:53.140> use

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
like that let's do that you can use

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.650 
like that let's do that you can use
these<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.890> actually<00:04:54.160> push<00:04:54.370> blocks<00:04:54.700> up<00:04:54.880> or

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
these to actually push blocks up or

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.210 
these to actually push blocks up or
yourself<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:58.450> fun<00:04:58.690> Oh<00:05:00.060> broke<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.270> anyways

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
yourself it's so fun Oh broke it anyways

yourself it's so fun Oh broke it anyways
so<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.430> this<00:05:03.820> is<00:05:03.910> basically<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.330> mod

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
so this is this is basically the mod

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.300 
so this is this is basically the mod
adds<00:05:04.720> these<00:05:04.960> pistons<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.530> its<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.040> they're

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
adds these pistons in its and they're
