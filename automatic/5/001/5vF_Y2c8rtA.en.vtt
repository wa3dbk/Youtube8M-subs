00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.929 
gonna properly look at the stats of this
now<00:04:01.959> just<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.439> just<00:04:02.680> try<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.340> church<00:04:03.549> it's

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
now just to just try and church it's

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.009 
now just to just try and church it's
just<00:04:04.450> crazy

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
just crazy

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.039 
just crazy
so<00:04:05.379> it's<00:04:05.530> got<00:04:05.709> normal-ish<00:04:06.609> kind<00:04:06.939> of<00:04:07.030> held<00:04:07.180> it's

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
so it's got normal-ish kind of held it's

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.500 
so it's got normal-ish kind of held it's
quite<00:04:08.349> fast<00:04:08.620> like<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:09.700> got<00:04:09.879> 800<00:04:10.359> brake

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510

if<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.639> even<00:04:27.759> get<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.120> kind<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.419> an<00:04:28.539> angle

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
if you even get this kind of an angle

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.969 
if you even get this kind of an angle
you<00:04:28.840> should<00:04:28.930> be<00:04:29.110> able<00:04:29.169> to<00:04:29.259> just<00:04:29.440> bang<00:04:29.680> there

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
you should be able to just bang there

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.990 
you should be able to just bang there
and<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.250> should<00:04:30.430> go<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:33.280> rate<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.639> fire<00:04:33.820> is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
and it should go in the rate of fire is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.830 
and it should go in the rate of fire is
two<00:04:34.300> rounds<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.080> minute<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:37.270> we<00:04:37.360> compare<00:04:37.720> that

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
two rounds a minute when we compare that

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.890

to an e100 YAG panzer zone what's the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.839 
to an e100 YAG panzer zone what's the

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
rate of fire open e100 yeah group that's

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.920

2.33<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:51.789> that's<00:04:52.570> like<00:04:53.020> balanced<00:04:53.710> when<00:04:53.919> you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
2.33 so that's like balanced when you

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.060 
2.33 so that's like balanced when you

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
consider the a piano but the thing is is

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.279 
consider the a piano but the thing is is
that<00:04:57.340> we're<00:04:57.699> not<00:04:57.849> firing<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.360> PMO<00:04:58.810> are<00:04:58.990> we<00:04:59.139> were

that we're not firing a PMO are we were

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.189 
that we're not firing a PMO are we were

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.260 
firing this beautiful stuff it's
beautiful

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270

dang and even if you don't penetrate the
tank<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.199> just<00:05:17.349> splashes<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:17.979> does<00:05:18.159> like<00:05:18.370> 600

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
tank it just splashes and does like 600

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.469

to<00:05:19.330> 700<00:05:19.659> maybe<00:05:20.080> even<00:05:20.349> higher<00:05:21.150> pretty<00:05:22.150> crazy

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
to 700 maybe even higher pretty crazy

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.330 
to 700 maybe even higher pretty crazy
the<00:05:23.139> fact<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.440> this<00:05:23.560> thing<00:05:23.770> can<00:05:23.919> only<00:05:24.009> carry

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
the fact that this thing can only carry

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.279 
the fact that this thing can only carry
12<00:05:24.699> shells<00:05:25.030> I<00:05:25.330> guess<00:05:25.570> means<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.139> it's

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
12 shells I guess means that it's

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.890 
12 shells I guess means that it's
limited<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.130> 10,000<00:05:28.030> damage<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.389> game<00:05:28.599> if<00:05:28.780> it

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
limited to 10,000 damage a game if it

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.749 
limited to 10,000 damage a game if it
pens<00:05:29.110> all<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.409> its<00:05:29.530> shots<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:30.460> don't<00:05:30.580> want<00:05:30.699> to

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
pens all of its shots you don't want to

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.629 
pens all of its shots you don't want to
waste<00:05:30.940> your<00:05:31.090> shells<00:05:31.419> on<00:05:31.630> this<00:05:31.810> though<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:33.520> is

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
waste your shells on this though this is

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.810 
waste your shells on this though this is
a<00:05:33.669> very<00:05:33.940> powerful<00:05:34.120> tank<00:05:34.740> if<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:36.370> stays<00:05:36.580> like

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
a very powerful tank if it stays like

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.670 
a very powerful tank if it stays like
this<00:05:36.880> then<00:05:37.570> I'm<00:05:37.750> definitely<00:05:38.289> going<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:38.500> grind

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
this then I'm definitely going to grind

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.780 
this then I'm definitely going to grind
for<00:05:38.950> one<00:05:39.389> what<00:05:40.389> I<00:05:40.419> think<00:05:40.750> they<00:05:40.960> will<00:05:41.080> do

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
for one what I think they will do

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.350 
for one what I think they will do
I'm<00:05:42.360> calling<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.170> now<00:05:44.030> they're<00:05:45.030> going<00:05:45.240> to

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
I'm calling it now they're going to

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.290 
I'm calling it now they're going to
reduce<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:46.700> they'll<00:05:47.700> reduce<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.180> average

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
reduce the they'll reduce the average

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.190 
reduce the they'll reduce the average
damage<00:05:48.720> of<00:05:48.900> Heche<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:49.520> 1500<00:05:50.520> firstly<00:05:51.450> they'll

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
damage of Heche to 1500 firstly they'll

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.860 
damage of Heche to 1500 firstly they'll
just<00:05:52.380> reduce<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:52.980> if<00:05:53.180> they<00:05:54.180> don't<00:05:54.480> do<00:05:54.690> that

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
just reduce this if they don't do that

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.390 
just reduce this if they don't do that
then<00:05:55.440> they're<00:05:55.650> going<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:55.890> reduce<00:05:56.220> the

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
then they're going to reduce the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.250 
then they're going to reduce the
penetration<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:57.420> like<00:05:58.130> like<00:05:59.130> 200<00:05:59.760> ish<00:06:00.050> when<00:06:01.050> we

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
penetration to like like 200 ish when we

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.930 
penetration to like like 200 ish when we
consider<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.950> own<00:06:02.130> one<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.640> only<00:06:02.790> other

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
consider the own one of the only other

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.850 
consider the own one of the only other
tanks<00:06:03.420> in<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.630> game<00:06:03.660> that<00:06:04.020> can<00:06:04.170> use<00:06:04.380> her<00:06:04.620> Shamu

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
tanks in the game that can use her Shamu

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.770 
tanks in the game that can use her Shamu
it<00:06:05.070> might<00:06:05.250> even<00:06:05.400> be<00:06:05.670> the<00:06:05.790> only<00:06:05.970> other<00:06:06.300> tank<00:06:06.630> in

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
it might even be the only other tank in
