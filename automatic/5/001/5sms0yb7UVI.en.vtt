Garchomp so what I'm gonna do is predict

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.609 
Garchomp so what I'm gonna do is predict
him<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> reflect<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.439> gonna

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
him to go for the reflect and I'm gonna

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
him to go for the reflect and I'm gonna
go<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> jerky<00:01:44.280> meter<00:01:44.579> which<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.119> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
go for the jerky meter which to be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
go for the jerky meter which to be
honest<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.720> thought<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.950> easy

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
honest I thought would do like an easy

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
honest I thought would do like an easy
ninety<00:01:48.479> percent<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.079> no<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> only<00:01:49.560> does<00:01:49.799> about

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
ninety percent but no it only does about

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
ninety percent but no it only does about
sixty<00:01:50.520> percent<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
sixty percent so I was really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
sixty percent so I was really
questioning<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.250> fact<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.700> whether<00:01:53.970> or<00:01:54.210> not

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
questioning the fact on whether or not

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
questioning the fact on whether or not
this<00:01:54.570> earthquake<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.439> able<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> knock

this earthquake would be able to knock
them<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.540> mega<00:01:57.540> Garchomp<00:01:58.170> physical

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
them out but mega Garchomp physical

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
them out but mega Garchomp physical
attacks<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.640> just<00:02:00.000> off<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> charts

crazy<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.149> than<00:02:03.299> enough<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
crazy so that is more than enough to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
crazy so that is more than enough to
knock<00:02:04.649> him<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.920> even<00:02:05.219> though<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> only<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.939> 16

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
choice band which completely escaped my

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.470 
choice band which completely escaped my
mind<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.769> he<00:03:18.890> had<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.430> choice<00:03:19.910> band<00:03:20.209> and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
mind so if he had the choice band and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.789 
mind so if he had the choice band and
actually<00:03:20.989> would<00:03:21.079> have<00:03:21.110> been<00:03:21.260> bad<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.500> me<00:03:21.680> but

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
actually would have been bad for me but

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.530 
actually would have been bad for me but
yeah<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.549> really<00:03:22.670> fun<00:03:22.820> set<00:03:23.239> I'm

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
yeah this is just a really fun set I'm

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.240 
yeah this is just a really fun set I'm
not<00:03:23.900> saying<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.470> good<00:03:24.680> set<00:03:24.950> because<00:03:25.100> I

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
not saying it's a good set because I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.500 
not saying it's a good set because I
really<00:03:25.549> doubt<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:26.299> definitely

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
really doubt it is but it's definitely

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.030 
really doubt it is but it's definitely
fun<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.769> then<00:03:27.920> go

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
fun so if you want to use it then go

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.500 
fun so if you want to use it then go
ahead<00:03:28.160> just<00:03:28.489> don't<00:03:28.549> say<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.060> said<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.420> was

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
ahead just don't say that I said it was

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.420 
ahead just don't say that I said it was
a<00:03:29.540> good<00:03:29.720> set<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.230> then<00:03:30.860> I'm<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.070> gonna<00:03:31.220> leave

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
a good set and then I'm just gonna leave

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.759 
a good set and then I'm just gonna leave
in<00:03:31.579> Delft<00:03:31.760> Oxford<00:03:32.209> f<00:03:32.480> water<00:03:32.720> because<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> really

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
in Delft Oxford f water because I really

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.289 
in Delft Oxford f water because I really
don't<00:03:34.190> want<00:03:34.370> anything<00:03:34.549> on<00:03:34.760> my<00:03:34.820> team<00:03:35.000> switching

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
don't want anything on my team switching

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.460 
don't want anything on my team switching
into<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.840> thought<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.260> switch

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
into this and I thought that the switch

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.979 
into this and I thought that the switch
into<00:03:36.769> my<00:03:36.890> ferrothorn<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:38.780> bit<00:03:38.900> too

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
into my ferrothorn was a little bit too

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.199 
into my ferrothorn was a little bit too
obvious<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.370> i<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.579> get<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.850> free<00:03:40.970> switch

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
obvious so now i can get a free switch

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.550 
obvious so now i can get a free switch
into<00:03:41.480> my<00:03:41.570> star<00:03:41.840> me<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.110> I'm<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.290> gonna<00:03:42.410> make

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
into my star me and I'm just gonna make

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.199 
into my star me and I'm just gonna make
a<00:03:42.620> safe<00:03:42.829> play<00:03:43.010> I'm<00:03:43.400> gonna<00:03:43.640> go<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.000> Thunder

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
a safe play I'm gonna go for the Thunder

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.300 
a safe play I'm gonna go for the Thunder
ball<00:03:44.329> as<00:03:44.420> he<00:03:44.540> turns<00:03:44.720> out<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.870> be<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.260> guy<00:03:45.560> who

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
ball as he turns out to be that guy who

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.819 
ball as he turns out to be that guy who
switches<00:03:46.579> in<00:03:46.820> a<00:03:47.150> ground-type<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.350> water

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
switches in a ground-type on a water

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.770 
switches in a ground-type on a water
type<00:03:49.100> predicting<00:03:49.940> them<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.269> go<00:03:50.420> for<00:03:50.690> another

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
type predicting them to go for another

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.710 
type predicting them to go for another
move<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.890> never<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.150> now<00:03:53.450> I'm<00:03:53.600> gonna

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
move you never do that so now I'm gonna

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.660 
move you never do that so now I'm gonna
go<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.079> hydro<00:03:54.320> pump<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.739> he<00:03:55.280> predicts

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
go for the hydro pump and he predicts

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.979 
go for the hydro pump and he predicts
that<00:03:55.730> as<00:03:55.910> well<00:03:56.090> as<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.360> brings<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.750> ferret

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that as well as it brings in the ferret

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.720 
that as well as it brings in the ferret
on<00:03:57.049> which<00:03:57.200> honestly<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:58.250> fact<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.549> he's

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
on which honestly the fact that he's

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.250 
on which honestly the fact that he's
switching<00:03:59.060> like<00:03:59.360> this<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.660> actually<00:03:59.959> helping

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
switching like this is actually helping

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.860 
switching like this is actually helping
me<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.150> just<00:04:02.180> stalling<00:04:02.630> out

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
me out because this is just stalling out

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.590 
me out because this is just stalling out
his<00:04:03.170> turn<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.680> screens<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.970> really<00:04:05.390> need

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
his turn of screens which I really need

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.449 
his turn of screens which I really need
to<00:04:05.750> be<00:04:05.900> down<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.380> can<00:04:06.470> just<00:04:06.590> start<00:04:06.950> hitting

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
to be down so I can just start hitting

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.970 
to be down so I can just start hitting
his<00:04:07.700> team<00:04:08.000> very<00:04:08.810> very<00:04:09.019> hard<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.500> she<00:04:09.530> saw<00:04:09.769> their

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
his team very very hard so she saw their

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.640 
his team very very hard so she saw their
the<00:04:10.130> light<00:04:10.280> screen<00:04:10.519> goes<00:04:10.700> down<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:12.380> think

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
the light screen goes down and I think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.870 
the light screen goes down and I think
he<00:04:12.739> acts<00:04:12.859> 14<00:04:13.100> lights<00:04:13.280> would<00:04:13.489> have<00:04:13.609> to<00:04:13.700> reflect

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
he acts 14 lights would have to reflect

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.789 
he acts 14 lights would have to reflect
so<00:04:14.180> both<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.780> your<00:04:15.019> spoons<00:04:15.260> are<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.530> at<00:04:15.680> this

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
so both of your spoons are down at this

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.560 
so both of your spoons are down at this
point<00:04:16.039> as<00:04:16.160> I'm<00:04:16.549> going<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.760> switch<00:04:16.910> into<00:04:17.120> my

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
point as I'm going to switch into my

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.509 
point as I'm going to switch into my
sharkeisha<00:04:18.140> he<00:04:18.620> unfortunately<00:04:18.859> missed<00:04:19.370> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
sharkeisha he unfortunately missed the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.190 
sharkeisha he unfortunately missed the
power<00:04:19.760> with<00:04:19.940> which<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.180> be<00:04:20.450> honest<00:04:20.750> really

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
power with which to be honest really

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.719 
power with which to be honest really
wouldn't<00:04:21.470> have<00:04:21.560> done<00:04:21.680> too<00:04:21.950> much<00:04:22.099> damage<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
wouldn't have done too much damage and

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.660 
wouldn't have done too much damage and
if<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.360> saw<00:04:23.539> his<00:04:23.720> team<00:04:23.990> nothing<00:04:24.919> really

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
if you saw his team nothing really

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.910 
if you saw his team nothing really
safely<00:04:26.060> switches<00:04:26.450> into<00:04:26.630> any<00:04:27.050> move<00:04:27.440> coming

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
safely switches into any move coming

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.340 
safely switches into any move coming
from<00:04:28.280> my<00:04:28.460> mega<00:04:28.730> Garchomp<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:29.570> he's<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.110> gonna

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
from my mega Garchomp so he's just gonna

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.050 
from my mega Garchomp so he's just gonna
fire<00:04:30.620> off<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.980> ferret<00:04:31.280> on<00:04:31.370> either<00:04:31.580> there<00:04:31.820> or

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
fire off the ferret on either there or

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.150 
fire off the ferret on either there or
maybe<00:04:32.420> he<00:04:32.630> thought<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.840> didn't<00:04:33.140> have<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.650> fire

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
maybe he thought I didn't have a fire

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.220 
maybe he thought I didn't have a fire
type<00:04:34.370> move<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:34.760> Fire<00:04:34.970> Blast<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.480> common<00:04:36.080> on

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
type move but Fire Blast is common on

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.720 
type move but Fire Blast is common on
Garchomp<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.070> he's<00:04:37.190> gonna<00:04:37.280> bring<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.640> the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
Garchomp so he's gonna bring in the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.190 
Garchomp so he's gonna bring in the
asthma<00:04:38.120> he's<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.480> gonna<00:04:38.570> go<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:39.080> the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
asthma he's just gonna go for the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.230 
asthma he's just gonna go for the
Aquajet<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.920> get<00:04:40.040> off<00:04:40.160> from<00:04:40.250> chip<00:04:40.640> damage<00:04:41.030> on

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
Aquajet to get off from chip damage on

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.360 
Aquajet to get off from chip damage on
my<00:04:41.570> Garchomp<00:04:42.350> which<00:04:42.740> I'm<00:04:42.860> able<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.160> easily

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
my Garchomp which I'm able to easily

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.310 
my Garchomp which I'm able to easily
take<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.760> hit<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.510> surprisingly

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
take the hit and then I surprisingly

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.200 
take the hit and then I surprisingly
enough<00:04:45.710> knock<00:04:46.370> him<00:04:46.520> out<00:04:46.640> with<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.850> earthquake

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
enough knock him out with the earthquake

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.630 
enough knock him out with the earthquake
again<00:04:47.450> I'm<00:04:47.600> just<00:04:47.780> really<00:04:48.200> under<00:04:49.130> estimating

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
again I'm just really under estimating

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.970 
again I'm just really under estimating
the<00:04:49.850> physical<00:04:50.300> power<00:04:50.510> of<00:04:50.840> mega<00:04:51.290> Garchomp<00:04:51.860> so

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
the physical power of mega Garchomp so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.440 
the physical power of mega Garchomp so
he's<00:04:52.130> gonna<00:04:52.220> bring<00:04:52.430> in<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.610> charge<00:04:52.880> art<00:04:53.090> and

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
he's gonna bring in the charge art and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.700 
he's gonna bring in the charge art and
it<00:04:53.540> turns<00:04:53.720> out<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:53.900> i'm<00:04:54.080> actually<00:04:54.170> faster

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
it turns out that i'm actually faster

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.770 
it turns out that i'm actually faster
than<00:04:55.070> him<00:04:55.250> which<00:04:55.700> means<00:04:55.910> he<00:04:56.120> has<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.420> be

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
than him which means he has to be

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.230 
than him which means he has to be
adamant<00:04:57.110> because<00:04:57.230> no<00:04:57.890> charge<00:04:58.610> on<00:04:58.760> why<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.000> i

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
adamant because no charge on why that i

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.030 
adamant because no charge on why that i
have<00:04:59.450> ever<00:04:59.660> seen<00:04:59.930> runs<00:05:00.260> modest<00:05:00.680> which<00:05:00.830> means

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
have ever seen runs modest which means

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.490 
have ever seen runs modest which means
he<00:05:01.400> is<00:05:01.520> definitely<00:05:01.820> Charizard<00:05:02.600> X<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.990> further

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
he is definitely Charizard X and further

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.900 
he is definitely Charizard X and further
confirms<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.100> fact<00:05:04.310> as<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.580> goes<00:05:04.700> for<00:05:04.850> the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
confirms the fact as it goes for the

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.000 
confirms the fact as it goes for the
dragon<00:05:05.330> dance<00:05:05.510> but<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.140> fact<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.530> he<00:05:06.650> didn't

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
dragon dance but the fact that he didn't

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.370 
dragon dance but the fact that he didn't
actually<00:05:07.190> mega<00:05:07.640> evolve<00:05:08.000> was<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.540> very<00:05:09.050> very

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
actually mega evolve was a very very

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.800 
actually mega evolve was a very very
smart<00:05:09.770> play<00:05:10.040> on<00:05:10.100> his<00:05:10.310> part<00:05:10.340> because<00:05:11.300> my<00:05:11.450> jerky

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
smart play on his part because my jerky

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.840 
smart play on his part because my jerky
meter<00:05:11.990> was<00:05:12.230> still<00:05:12.470> neutral<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.250> instead<00:05:13.760> of

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
meter was still neutral and instead of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.370 
meter was still neutral and instead of
it<00:05:13.910> being<00:05:13.940> super<00:05:14.300> fact<00:05:14.510> he<00:05:14.660> was<00:05:14.810> able<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.170> live

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
it being super fact he was able to live

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.530 
it being super fact he was able to live
the<00:05:15.530> hit<00:05:15.680> dragon<00:05:16.160> dance<00:05:16.370> in<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:16.820> turn<00:05:17.090> he's

the hit dragon dance in this turn he's

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.480 
the hit dragon dance in this turn he's
gonna<00:05:17.690> be<00:05:17.840> able<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:18.110> easily<00:05:18.380> dragon<00:05:18.860> dad's<00:05:19.040> out

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.290 
speed me and knock on my mega Garchomp
which<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.130> actually<00:05:22.280> perfectly<00:05:22.730> fine<00:05:22.880> by<00:05:23.090> me

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
which is actually perfectly fine by me

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.470 
which is actually perfectly fine by me
because<00:05:23.480> i<00:05:23.690> still<00:05:24.080> have<00:05:24.350> my<00:05:24.680> age<00:05:25.190> /<00:05:25.610> although

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
knowing my luck he's probably gonna live

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.430 
knowing my luck he's probably gonna live
with<00:05:28.910> Sharon<00:05:28.970> see<00:05:29.360> because<00:05:29.540> as<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:30.020> said<00:05:30.080> this

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
with Sharon see because as I said this

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.040 
with Sharon see because as I said this
is<00:05:30.500> my<00:05:30.740> mixed<00:05:31.070> aegislash<00:05:31.460> so<00:05:32.120> I'm<00:05:32.600> gonna<00:05:32.840> go

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
is my mixed aegislash so I'm gonna go

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.270 
is my mixed aegislash so I'm gonna go
for<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.290> shadow<00:05:33.560> seek<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:33.980> this<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.190> the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
for the shadow seek and this is the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.050 
for the shadow seek and this is the
moment<00:05:34.430> of<00:05:34.610> truth<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:35.590> I'm<00:05:36.590> able<00:05:37.040> to<00:05:37.730> knock

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
moment of truth and I'm able to knock

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.720 
moment of truth and I'm able to knock
him<00:05:38.240> out<00:05:38.390> with<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:39.770> shadows<00:05:40.250> think<00:05:40.430> this<00:05:40.550> was

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
him out with the shadows think this was

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.730 
him out with the shadows think this was
like<00:05:40.940> probably<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.510> most<00:05:41.750> important<00:05:42.410> turn<00:05:42.560> of

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
like probably the most important turn of

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.830 
like probably the most important turn of
the<00:05:42.830> battle<00:05:43.130> because<00:05:43.460> i<00:05:43.490> have<00:05:43.910> seen<00:05:44.210> mega

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
the battle because i have seen mega

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.470 
the battle because i have seen mega
charizard<00:05:45.410> x<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.950> carrier<00:05:46.370> roost<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:47.210> he<00:05:47.360> was

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
charizard x that carrier roost so he was

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.240 
charizard x that carrier roost so he was
he<00:05:47.720> might<00:05:47.930> have<00:05:48.080> been<00:05:48.470> able<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.770> go<00:05:48.980> for<00:05:49.220> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
he might have been able to go for the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.770 
he might have been able to go for the
roost<00:05:49.490> and<00:05:49.700> then<00:05:49.850> just<00:05:50.030> sweep<00:05:50.390> through<00:05:50.690> my

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
roost and then just sweep through my

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.870 
roost and then just sweep through my
team<00:05:51.050> so<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.710> fact<00:05:51.950> that<00:05:52.040> my<00:05:52.190> aegislash<00:05:52.550> was

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
team so the fact that my aegislash was

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.580 
team so the fact that my aegislash was
able<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.210> knock<00:05:53.390> him<00:05:53.540> out<00:05:53.630> just<00:05:53.870> really<00:05:54.260> save

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
able to knock him out just really save

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.620 
able to knock him out just really save
me<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:54.920> battle<00:05:55.250> right<00:05:55.400> there<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.850> save<00:05:56.390> me

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
me the battle right there and save me

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.380 
me the battle right there and save me
from<00:05:56.840> being<00:05:57.350> swept<00:05:57.680> by<00:05:57.920> this<00:05:58.220> Charizard<00:05:58.700> X<00:05:58.820> so

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
from being swept by this Charizard X so

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.480

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
I switch it to my Rotom on this exit row

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.130 
I switch it to my Rotom on this exit row
