écoles<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.960> sometimes<00:01:12.960> Qinghai<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
écoles and sometimes Qinghai will be the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
écoles and sometimes Qinghai will be the
best<00:01:13.890> hand

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.080 

non-standard<00:01:17.380> call<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:17.979> by<00:01:18.159> Coleman<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:18.939> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
non-standard call here by Coleman on the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.620 
non-standard call here by Coleman on the
flop<00:01:19.329> with<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.600> king<00:01:19.869> queen<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:22.299> great

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
flop with the king queen it's not great

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.090 
flop with the king queen it's not great
I<00:01:22.659> think<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.170> fraught<00:01:23.409> with<00:01:23.439> some<00:01:23.710> problems

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I think it's fraught with some problems

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.819 
I think it's fraught with some problems
it<00:01:24.280> major<00:01:25.000> problems<00:01:25.600> certainly<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:26.380> only<00:01:26.710> way

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
it major problems certainly the only way

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.080 
it major problems certainly the only way
that<00:01:26.859> this<00:01:27.069> is<00:01:27.219> a<00:01:27.250> good<00:01:27.460> call<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.819> if<00:01:27.969> he's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
that this is a good call is if he's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.849 
that this is a good call is if he's
ahead<00:01:28.329> sometimes<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.409> fair

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
ahead sometimes and to be fair

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.349 
ahead sometimes and to be fair
Ryan<00:01:30.100> fee<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.369> an<00:01:30.520> active<00:01:30.789> player<00:01:30.999> so<00:01:31.209> I<00:01:31.240> think

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
Ryan fee is an active player so I think

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.300 
Ryan fee is an active player so I think
Coleman<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.929> ahead<00:01:32.079> sometimes<00:01:32.500> now<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
Coleman is ahead sometimes now the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.550 
Coleman is ahead sometimes now the
biggest<00:01:33.700> problem<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.390> reversed<00:01:34.780> domination

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
biggest problem is reversed domination

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980 
biggest problem is reversed domination
yeah<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.310> mean<00:01:36.670> Queen<00:01:37.119> ten<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.569> King<00:01:37.689> 10<00:01:37.840> make

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
yeah I mean Queen ten and King 10 make

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.899 
yeah I mean Queen ten and King 10 make
up<00:01:38.109> a<00:01:38.170> fair<00:01:38.409> amount<00:01:38.439> of<00:01:38.770> fees<00:01:39.039> value<00:01:39.520> range<00:01:39.729> I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
up a fair amount of fees value range I

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.370 
up a fair amount of fees value range I
think<00:01:40.359> this<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.630> only<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.869> good<00:01:40.990> call<00:01:41.200> by<00:01:41.319> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
think this is only a good call by the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.510 
think this is only a good call by the
way<00:01:41.500> he<00:01:41.619> isn't<00:01:41.920> just<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.159> he<00:01:42.219> has<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.429> be

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
way he isn't just that he has to be

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.190 
way he isn't just that he has to be
ahead<00:01:42.729> sometimes<00:01:42.969> hissy<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:43.810> ahead<00:01:43.899> sometimes

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
ahead sometimes hissy be ahead sometimes

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.809 
ahead sometimes hissy be ahead sometimes
and<00:01:44.500> also<00:01:44.709> he<00:01:44.829> has<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:44.979> win<00:01:45.189> sometimes<00:01:45.640> with

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
and also he has to win sometimes with

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.309 
and also he has to win sometimes with
the<00:01:45.909> worst<00:01:46.090> hand<00:01:46.299> he's<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.840> make<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> play

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
the worst hand he's to make a play

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.529 
the worst hand he's to make a play
somewhere<00:01:47.740> along<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.129> way<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.789> win<00:01:48.969> because

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
somewhere along the way to win because

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.479 
somewhere along the way to win because
he<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.349> never<00:01:50.560> going<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.860> get<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.340> river

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
he is never going to get to the river

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:52.709 
he is never going to get to the river
and<00:01:51.700> check<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.030> down<00:01:52.149> with<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.360> hand<00:01:52.539> worse

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
and check it down with the hand worse

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.229 
and check it down with the hand worse
than<00:01:52.959> that<00:01:53.079> very<00:01:53.530> often<00:01:53.739> anyway<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.819> don't

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.239 
than that very often anyway so I don't

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.490 
than that very often anyway so I don't
know<00:01:55.420> you're<00:01:55.539> going<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.689> just<00:01:55.869> hero<00:01:56.110> with<00:01:56.289> king

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
know you're going to just hero with king

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.499 
know you're going to just hero with king
queen<00:01:56.739> is<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.189> big<00:01:57.340> plan<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:58.149> appears

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
queen is that the big plan it appears

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.300 
queen is that the big plan it appears
that<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:58.689> might<00:01:59.049> be<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.259> plan<00:01:59.590> maybe<00:01:59.979> looks

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
that that might be the plan maybe looks

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580 
that that might be the plan maybe looks
a<00:02:00.459> lot<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:00.879> that's<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.270> plan<00:02:01.509> it'll<00:02:02.469> be

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
a lot like that's the plan it'll be

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.139 
a lot like that's the plan it'll be
really<00:02:02.739> hard<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.069> make<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> play<00:02:03.579> with<00:02:03.879> fees

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
really hard to make a play with fees

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.690 
really hard to make a play with fees
sack<00:02:04.959> upon<00:02:05.229> ratio<00:02:05.530> being<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:05.920> small<00:02:06.189> already

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
sack upon ratio being so small already

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.839 
sack upon ratio being so small already
yeah<00:02:07.329> we<00:02:07.750> talk<00:02:07.959> a<00:02:07.989> lot<00:02:08.170> about<00:02:08.229> more<00:02:09.009> about<00:02:09.220> fees

might be opening suited connectors and
things<00:04:12.079> like<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:12.500> it's<00:04:12.650> less<00:04:12.980> likely

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280

bluffing with the Coleman can beat and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580 
bluffing with the Coleman can beat and
this<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.180> major<00:04:23.450> problem<00:04:23.780> for<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.169> call

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
this is a major problem for this call

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.990 
this is a major problem for this call
I<00:04:24.620> think<00:04:24.889> Coleman<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.220> wanted<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.580> be<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.700> hero

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
I think Coleman just wanted to be a hero

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.150 
I think Coleman just wanted to be a hero
and<00:04:26.240> he<00:04:26.330> failed<00:04:27.020> miserably<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.650> mean<00:04:27.919> if<00:04:28.070> you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
and he failed miserably I mean if you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.800 
and he failed miserably I mean if you
think<00:04:28.190> about<00:04:28.430> what<00:04:28.940> are<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> hands<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.479> fees

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
think about what are the hands that fees

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.290

is<00:04:30.080> bluffing<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.520> Coleman<00:04:31.849> actually

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
is bluffing with that Coleman actually

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.060 
is bluffing with that Coleman actually
