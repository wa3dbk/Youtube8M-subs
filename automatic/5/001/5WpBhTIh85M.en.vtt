00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.240
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.550
 performance of the a-6 for notebook 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.750
 with shared video card from 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.689
 ram memory of 512 in this case in this 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.509
 episode we have to try the grand theft 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 car 4 although we know it came out in the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.750
 2009 but then 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 let's compare it 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.960
 to its performance in this processor 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.080
 they ask us 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 the graphics 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.080
 - these graphics configurations 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 medium low low medium 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.240
 using 306 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.630
 come from the shared memory that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.630
 we have 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 and so 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.990
 well let's see what the analysis is 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 technical 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.050
 well we are already in again 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.050
 and I was recording but 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.660
 this got stuck he can not stand is recording 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.730
 the same time so it's fast the 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.800
 configurations already saw them in the 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.800
 first part and this 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.690
 yes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 balls 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.120
 well we see how the game works like 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.120
 it looks 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.940
 how can we provoke a fight 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 dog give me money I'm poor 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.650
 immigrant of Roman and is over there 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.549
 the dog fault 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.750
 I already nobody 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.930
 and you get discoverer even with age 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.580
 well I did not have money 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.930
 I don `t believe 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.930
 to see them 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 I want more 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.600
 yes sir police 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.319
 good would be all the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.709
 example of this day 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.110
 trying the grand theft auto 4 and I'm going to 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.330
 make a comparison between courses 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.240
 that I will use and that will use the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.940
 right point 4 good forgiveness in the big one 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.520
 point 5 with the grand theft auto 4 to see 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.160
 what differences are there and if possible if 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.640
 is supported by this computer and if so 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.430
 Well, I'll buy it and make a new video 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.670
 Well I hope you liked it I hope 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.489
 that you do not do not waste your money if 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.240
 it's not that they do not have a computer with 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.240
 the minimum requirements 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.360
 it would be everything 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.910
 do not forget to like to subscribe 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.270
 comment your doubts and that another game 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.270
 they want me to go up to do the test
