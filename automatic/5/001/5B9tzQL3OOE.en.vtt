"THE ART OF TURNING"

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.762
In this episode, we will discover a secret
that all the men are interested in.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.615
We will find out how guys can charm girls.

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.079
But before we puzzle our characters
with learning to turn

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:36.760
and the extort the secret mentioned above

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:40.375
let's meet the sportive and competitive Mikk

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:42.800
and always beautiful and effeminate Irina.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960
I'm Mikk Rajaver, I play a lot of football
and do other sports.

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:52.785
I am Irina, nail technician, 
I like sports

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:54.242
especially going to gym.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.396
Salsa was introduced to me by girlfriend
who took me to couple of salsaparties.

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:03.013
I watched all these people dancing
and moving smoothly.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:06.769
my girlfriend is pretty good too but
I couldn't keep up unfortunately

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.878
although she tried to teach me.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:15.618
This latin life is quite interesting,
energetic and much fun.

00:01:17.407 --> 00:01:24.207
I was thinking of sad and dark autumn

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:28.603
and wished for something fun in my life.

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:33.882
I really like the chance to begin from zero
and with good teachers

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.667
who can brush up 
my moves and technique.

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:41.748
If I started learning by myself
and acquired bad habits

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.928
it would be difficult
to make up for it later.

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:47.871
People close to me thought it was cool,
everybody was pleased.

00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:54.132
I told to my football coach that
in autumn, I can't train as much anymore.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:58.530
He asked why.
I said I would attend a salsa course.

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:04.895
- What? - Salsa course! - Okay....
- I said: don't worry, I will stay in shape.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.574
It's physically quite demanding,
like going jogging for an hour.

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:15.814
I want to learn salsa
to have something new in my life.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.552
New dance, new people, 
new emotions, contacts, friends...

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:30.553
My goal is to go and prove
that I am able to improve in salsa.

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:43.504
Impressions are still good,
I still want to continue.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.819
Kristjan in the back, cheating with basics
and preparing for turns.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.240
There was a lot of turning
compared to the previous class.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:56.481
If I thought I could turn
then today proved me wrong.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.726
First time made me
kind of dizzy

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:09.006
especially when we had to turn on the spot
and repeat it several times.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.927
I couldn't believe we make it so far
all at once.

00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:16.656
This second class makes us 
run out of steam faster.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.336
It's getting sweaty already!

00:03:19.714 --> 00:03:21.960
My shirt is dripping a little, and my brow.

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.435
And new moves â€“ to the side.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.093
Partners danced a little better already.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.855
I still like this regular partner switching.

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:44.919
This girl wouldn't let me go 
and stayed for several times.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:50.206
Most of the time I got to stay with Irina
which is nice because she's moves well.

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:53.080
She didn't want to let me go at all.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:57.361
Let's just say it: I didn't let 
this one guy switch the next three times.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.720
Between you and me: he has danced
for 3 months already.

00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:08.761
I held on to him because
he knew how to lead and move me.

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.419
Felt exactly like I knew
how to be good at salsa already.

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:17.201
Really, it all goes well already:
turns, steps, everything...

00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.204
If the guy leads well already,
I have to work at it less,

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:22.767
compared to the others
who are not as good at leading.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:25.260
So THAT'S what girls like
about guys on the dancefloor.

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:27.585
But how do our guys fare with girls?

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:30.151
Yes, I usually get to know my partner.

00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:32.943
If somebody dances with me,
the first thing I do is ask her name.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.093
This is my "icebreaker".
I understand pretty quickly

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:41.422
if we are gonna talk, too, 
or there's gonna be awkward silence.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.735
I didn't &lt;i&gt;not like&lt;/i&gt; anybody

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.636
but I already found some girls I liked, yes.

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:53.260
I don't really want to switch partners
when the current one is very good.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.697
Today was only the second-ever class
but Irina attended eagerly

00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.385
her first salsa party already.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.995
I went to my first party at Bastioni aed,

00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:21.025
it was really cool, lots of people,

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.120
everybody dancing very well.

00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:26.179
I was like a little green chick among them.

00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:30.010
They were very energetic and
their dances were very nice.

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:34.195
Atmosphere was enjoyable, I like it.
I was asked to dance, too.

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:39.630
I had this pretty experienced guy
who made me turn a lot

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.640
which, honestly, made me dizzy.

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:43.915
There's no point to be afraid.

00:05:44.268 --> 00:05:49.011
Everybody's here to enjoy
this music and dances.

00:05:49.518 --> 00:05:53.061
Even if I'm not very good at dancing yet

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:56.867
I can still come and dance as they do.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.113
It wasn't terrifying, it was nice.

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.130
The others were not so confident yet.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.181
I didn't make it to salsaparty yet.

00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:12.893
Going to parties is maybe easier
with people you know: coursemates etc.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.668
We have already made a pact.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.985
We were getting worried about not seeing 
each other till next week's class.

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:25.529
And I proposed to meet at parties
if there's a wish to meet.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.184
If someone would miss the others,
one should just call and meet in Cubanita.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.334
I would like to go and check
if I am able to do those moves already.

00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:38.920
Like at my motorcycle course
where they let me on the street finally.

00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:42.726
It was so cool, 
I'd imagine it could be even better

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.545
if I can attend also parties now.

00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:49.978
Good salsa dancing starts from
proper frame.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.081
A soft but constant tension
between partners' hands

00:06:53.523 --> 00:06:54.901
which enables a guy to
lead the lady

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.924
and the lady to understand signals
the man gives her.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:00.574
We had to practice holding frame a lot.

00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:05.887
This partner of mine already said
that her hands were tired.

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:08.155
I said: let's just continue.

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:15.468
Beginners tend to not create or frame at all

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:17.942
or hold it too convulsively
or strongly

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:20.652
but it will improve with practice.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.829
I am ready to continue
and waiting for the third class.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.360
In the next episode we will get to know

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.360
Kristjan and Katriin

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.180
and will know who or what is... hammer-throw?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.240
And we'll also find out who

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.980
is afgraid of going to their first salsa party.
