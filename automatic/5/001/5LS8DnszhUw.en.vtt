- and after my brother took my for a
test<00:00:23.570> ride<00:00:23.920> he<00:00:24.920> decided<00:00:25.280> to<00:00:25.340> get<00:00:25.460> one<00:00:25.640> for

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
test ride he decided to get one for

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.060 
test ride he decided to get one for
myself<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.360> so<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:26.870> is<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.170> 3<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.950> the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
myself and so this is the 3 this is the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.150 
myself and so this is the 3 this is the
model<00:00:28.400> below<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:29.360> 2<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.890> I'm<00:00:30.890> just<00:00:31.010> gonna

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
model below the 2 and I'm just gonna

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.440 
model below the 2 and I'm just gonna
point<00:00:31.700> out<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.000> differences<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:32.620> the<00:00:33.620> two<00:00:34.450> the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
point out the differences so the two the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.540 
point out the differences so the two the
first<00:00:35.630> major<00:00:35.810> difference<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.980> fork<00:00:37.280> on

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
first major difference is the fork on

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.060 
first major difference is the fork on
this<00:00:37.940> one<00:00:38.120> is<00:00:38.300> carbon<00:00:38.630> fiber<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
this one is carbon fiber it's the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.140 
this one is carbon fiber it's the
firestarter<00:00:40.820> Fork<00:00:42.340> lightweight<00:00:43.340> very<00:00:43.790> stiff

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
firestarter Fork lightweight very stiff

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.950 
firestarter Fork lightweight very stiff
tons<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.200> tire<00:00:45.710> clearance<00:00:46.210> whereas<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.660> three

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
tons of tire clearance whereas the three

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.889 
tons of tire clearance whereas the three
uses<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.790> steel<00:00:49.790> fork<00:00:52.300> other<00:00:53.300> difference<00:00:53.750> is

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
uses a steel fork other difference is

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.110 
uses a steel fork other difference is
wheels<00:00:54.380> so<00:00:55.010> these<00:00:55.160> are<00:00:55.989> stands<00:00:56.989> ZT<00:00:57.739> are<00:00:58.120> rapid

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
wheels so these are stands ZT are rapid

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.310 
wheels so these are stands ZT are rapid
tubeless<00:00:59.510> compatible<00:01:01.780> one<00:01:02.780> thing<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:02.989> noticed

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
tubeless compatible one thing I noticed

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.110 
tubeless compatible one thing I noticed
is<00:01:03.500> because<00:01:03.829> it's<00:01:03.980> more<00:01:04.190> designed<00:01:04.699> for<00:01:04.820> tube

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
is because it's more designed for tube

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.520 
is because it's more designed for tube
lists<00:01:05.420> they<00:01:05.930> actually<00:01:06.200> don't<00:01:06.320> recommend

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
lists they actually don't recommend

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.000 
lists they actually don't recommend
running<00:01:07.130> high<00:01:07.310> pressure<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:09.140> any<00:01:09.470> tires<00:01:09.770> that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
running high pressure and any tires that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.770 
running high pressure and any tires that
you<00:01:10.100> put<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.400> here<00:01:10.670> because<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.479> think<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
you put on here because I think the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.469 
you put on here because I think the
sidewall<00:01:12.140> design<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.790> designed<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:14.000> run<00:01:14.150> at

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
sidewall design is designed to run at

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.700 
sidewall design is designed to run at
lower<00:01:14.630> pressures<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.170> time<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.560> I'm

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
lower pressures all the time so I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.590 
lower pressures all the time so I'm
running<00:01:15.830> tube<00:01:16.130> tires<00:01:16.369> here<00:01:16.729> these<00:01:17.240> 32

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
running tube tires here these 32

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.719 
running tube tires here these 32
millimeters<00:01:18.200> right<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.220> can't<00:01:19.549> run

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
millimeters right now and I can't run

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.920 
millimeters right now and I can't run
them<00:01:19.940> at<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.270> high<00:01:20.390> pressures<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.900> I<00:01:20.960> want

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
them at the high pressures that I want

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.350 
them at the high pressures that I want
that's<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.049> little<00:01:24.229> bit<00:01:24.409> annoying<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:26.090> bike

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
that's a little bit annoying this bike

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.980 
that's a little bit annoying this bike
uses<00:01:26.869> sun<00:01:27.619> inferno<00:01:28.190> 25<00:01:28.640> millimeter<00:01:29.060> wide<00:01:29.270> so

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
uses sun inferno 25 millimeter wide so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.450 
uses sun inferno 25 millimeter wide so
they're<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.350> bit<00:01:30.530> wider<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:30.890> they'll

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
they're a little bit wider so they'll

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.770 
they're a little bit wider so they'll
make<00:01:31.549> all<00:01:31.729> your<00:01:31.909> tires<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.659> bit<00:01:32.869> fatter

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
make all your tires a little bit fatter

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.250 
make all your tires a little bit fatter

the<00:01:42.260> two<00:01:42.470> uses<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:44.140> x9<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.070> back<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.840> an<00:01:47.840> X<00:01:48.049> 7

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
the two uses a x9 on the back and an X 7

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.960 
the two uses a x9 on the back and an X 7
on<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.590> front<00:01:48.830> where<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.130> think<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.580> is<00:01:49.700> an<00:01:49.820> X

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
on the front where I think this is an X

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.260

X<00:01:50.350> 5<00:01:51.350> on<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.710> front<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.220> X<00:01:52.430> 7<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.909> back<00:01:53.090> so

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
X 5 on the front and X 7 in the back so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.100 
X 5 on the front and X 7 in the back so
it's<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.450> step<00:01:53.630> down<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:53.900> terms<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.549> derailers

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
it's a step down in terms of derailers

to<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.910> shape<00:02:23.570> that's<00:02:23.780> similar<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.200> what<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:25.280> use

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
to a shape that's similar to what I use

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.420 
to a shape that's similar to what I use
on<00:02:25.520> all<00:02:25.790> my<00:02:26.060> other<00:02:26.360> bikes<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> same

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
on all my other bikes so it's the same

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.670 
on all my other bikes so it's the same
frame<00:02:28.870> looks<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.020> be<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.140> same<00:02:30.230> crank

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
frame looks to be the same crank

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610 
frame looks to be the same crank
probably<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> same<00:02:31.400> bottom<00:02:31.700> bracket<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.410> just

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
probably the same bottom bracket so just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.320 
probably the same bottom bracket so just
a<00:02:33.830> step<00:02:34.040> down<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.490> some<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.790> components

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
a step down and some of the components

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.710 
a step down and some of the components
although<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.170> think<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> brakes<00:02:36.800> are<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.820> same

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.600 

yeah<00:02:41.720> they're<00:02:41.960> bb7<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.830> they're<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.160> same<00:02:43.400> is

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
yeah they're bb7 so they're the same is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.780 
yeah they're bb7 so they're the same is
what<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.760> what<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.850> hubs<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
what I'm I have and what the hubs the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.280 
what I'm I have and what the hubs the
hubs<00:02:50.030> do<00:02:50.240> look<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.450> same<00:02:50.720> other<00:02:50.990> than<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
hubs do look the same other than the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.500 
hubs do look the same other than the
fact<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.560> minor<00:02:51.770> anodized<00:02:52.250> blue<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.820> match

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
fact that minor anodized blue to match

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.170 
fact that minor anodized blue to match
my<00:02:53.690> bike<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:55.160> comes<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:57.700> think<00:02:58.700> six

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
my bike so this comes in I think six

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.280 
my bike so this comes in I think six
seven<00:02:59.540> hundred<00:02:59.810> dollars<00:03:00.080> less<00:03:00.350> than<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
seven hundred dollars less than the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.170 
seven hundred dollars less than the
Fargo<00:03:03.290> two<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.280> fair<00:03:04.910> amount<00:03:05.120> of

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
Fargo two so it's a fair amount of

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.220 
Fargo two so it's a fair amount of
savings<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:08.450> now<00:03:08.630> I'm<00:03:08.720> running<00:03:08.840> narrower

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
savings right now I'm running narrower

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.910 
savings right now I'm running narrower

of clearance in the in the rear for them

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.420 
of clearance in the in the rear for them
to<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:22.330> really<00:03:23.330> nice<00:03:23.660> fun<00:03:23.900> tire<00:03:24.140> fast<00:03:24.739> awesome

cornering<00:03:27.100> excellent<00:03:28.100> shop<00:03:28.250> shock

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
cornering excellent shop shock

cornering excellent shop shock
absorption<00:03:29.110> large<00:03:30.110> diameter<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.070> get

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
absorption large diameter so you get

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.449 
absorption large diameter so you get
excellent<00:03:31.910> rollover<00:03:33.160> performance<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.310> you

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
excellent rollover performance that you

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:50.480 
excellent rollover performance that you
want<00:03:34.640> from<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.880> 29er<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:39.100> yep<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.570> bike

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.800 

you<00:03:51.490> think<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.760> gearing<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.330> same<00:03:52.570> so

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
you think the gearing is the same so

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.250 
you think the gearing is the same so
it's<00:03:52.960> a<00:03:53.050> 42<00:03:53.520> big<00:03:54.520> rating<00:03:54.850> 28<00:03:55.330> small<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.990> then

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
it's a 42 big rating 28 small and then

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.910 
it's a 42 big rating 28 small and then
11<00:03:56.560> 36<00:03:57.070> cassette<00:03:57.520> same<00:03:58.420> as<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.440> gearing<00:03:59.650> on

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
11 36 cassette same as the gearing on

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.950 
11 36 cassette same as the gearing on
the<00:04:00.430> Fargo<00:04:00.730> 3<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.150> there's<00:04:01.330> no<00:04:01.450> differences

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
the Fargo 3 so there's no differences

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.370 
the Fargo 3 so there's no differences
there

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
there

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.370 
there
it's<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.160> step<00:04:03.730> down<00:04:03.760> two<00:04:04.000> components<00:04:04.540> steel

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
it's just step down two components steel

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.630 
it's just step down two components steel
fork<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:06.850> different<00:04:07.450> wheel<00:04:07.570> set<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:09.280> all<00:04:09.490> in

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
fork a different wheel set but all in

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.140 
fork a different wheel set but all in
all<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.930> know<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.080> probably<00:04:11.350> won't<00:04:11.560> notice

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
all you know you probably won't notice

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.780 
all you know you probably won't notice
much<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.330> difference<00:04:13.360> just<00:04:13.720> writing<00:04:14.110> it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
much of a difference just writing it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.979 
much of a difference just writing it
theoretically<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.060> guess<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.450> fork<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.870> going

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
theoretically I guess that fork is going

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.120 
theoretically I guess that fork is going
to<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.170> lighter<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.650> better<00:04:17.859> shock

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
to be lighter with better shock

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.849 
to be lighter with better shock
absorption<00:04:18.489> stiffer<00:04:19.359> tighter<00:04:20.109> front<00:04:20.709> end

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
absorption stiffer tighter front end

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.290 
absorption stiffer tighter front end
because<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.280> uses<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.580> through<00:04:21.850> axle<00:04:22.210> design

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
because it uses a through axle design

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.100 
because it uses a through axle design
whereas<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.230> a<00:04:23.260> standard<00:04:23.790> quick-release

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.700 

so<00:04:29.110> yeah<00:04:29.740> just<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.190> quick<00:04:30.370> video<00:04:30.490> about<00:04:31.710> 2014

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
so yeah just a quick video about 2014

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.770 
so yeah just a quick video about 2014
it's<00:04:33.490> also<00:04:33.640> Fargo<00:04:34.180> 3<00:04:34.480> thanks<00:04:35.350> for<00:04:35.470> watching
