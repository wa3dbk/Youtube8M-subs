it's<00:02:51.210> quite<00:02:51.300> accurate<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:51.900> well<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.350> at<00:02:53.160> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's quite accurate as well and at that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.040 
it's quite accurate as well and at that
age<00:02:53.340> group<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.390> remember<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.930> was

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
age group in that I remember when I was

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.860 
age group in that I remember when I was
that<00:02:55.170> age<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.490> excited<00:02:56.520> by<00:02:57.210> boys<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that age I was so so excited by boys and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.650 
that age I was so so excited by boys and
I<00:02:58.020> had<00:02:58.260> huge<00:02:58.710> huge<00:02:59.190> crushes<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.540> could

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I had huge huge crushes and you could

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.450 
I had huge huge crushes and you could
equally<00:03:01.020> be<00:03:01.050> as<00:03:01.410> devastated<00:03:02.070> when<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.340> not

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
equally be as devastated when it's not

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.570 
equally be as devastated when it's not
equated<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.960> as<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:05.070> know<00:03:05.100> lavender

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
equated so I think as you know lavender

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.890 
equated so I think as you know lavender
Brown<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.330> she<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.600> quite<00:03:06.780> an

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
Brown I think that she is quite an

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500 
Brown I think that she is quite an
honest<00:03:07.260> character<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.830> think<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:09.090> she

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
honest character I think it's not she

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.410 
honest character I think it's not she
she<00:03:09.780> does<00:03:09.960> at<00:03:10.230> times<00:03:10.560> seem<00:03:11.520> probably<00:03:12.210> like<00:03:12.390> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
she does at times seem probably like a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960 
she does at times seem probably like a
bit<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.810> caricature<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> think<00:03:13.850> she<00:03:14.850> does

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
bit of a caricature but I think she does

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.640 
bit of a caricature but I think she does
just<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> big<00:03:15.780> heart<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.320> she's<00:03:16.500> just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
just have a big heart and she's just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
just have a big heart and she's just
quite<00:03:16.920> typical<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:18.210> of<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.390> teenager

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
quite typical of kind of a teenager

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.680 
quite typical of kind of a teenager
ready<00:03:19.590> he's<00:03:20.490> obsessed<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.150> wrong<00:03:22.880> um<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
ready he's obsessed with wrong um I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.440 
ready he's obsessed with wrong um I
think<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.890> think<00:03:26.550> it's<00:03:26.760> fun<00:03:26.940> because<00:03:27.150> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
think it's I think it's fun because I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.540 
think it's I think it's fun because I
think<00:03:27.510> we'll<00:03:27.990> all<00:03:28.290> maybe<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.950> year<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.370> two

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
think we'll all maybe a year or two

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.790 
think we'll all maybe a year or two
older<00:03:30.000> than<00:03:30.030> our<00:03:30.270> characters<00:03:31.080> are<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
older than our characters are in the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.340 
older than our characters are in the
books<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.670> films<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.540> feel<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.260> if

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
books and in the films so I feel so if

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.750 
books and in the films so I feel so if
we<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.680> experience<00:03:35.160> everything<00:03:35.430> first

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
we kind of experience everything first

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.700 
we kind of experience everything first
and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.140> experience

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
and then and then have that experience

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.820 
and then and then have that experience
then<00:03:38.250> apply<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.900> tip<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.140> characters<00:03:40.590> and

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
then apply to tip to the characters and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.040 
then apply to tip to the characters and
sometimes<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.840> sometimes<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.930> have
