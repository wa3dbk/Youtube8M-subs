because of the way they were laid out
although<00:00:42.949> I<00:00:43.249> have<00:00:43.670> my<00:00:43.850> own<00:00:43.999> theory

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
although I have my own theory

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.639 
although I have my own theory
we're<00:00:44.809> pretty<00:00:44.989> sure<00:00:45.109> that<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.469> lot<00:00:45.530> of

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
we're pretty sure that a lot of

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.729 
we're pretty sure that a lot of
sacrifice<00:00:46.159> has<00:00:46.370> happened<00:00:46.670> out<00:00:46.760> here<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:47.739> think

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
sacrifice has happened out here I think

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.369 
sacrifice has happened out here I think
people<00:00:48.949> just<00:00:49.010> died<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.280> exhaustion<00:00:49.789> /<00:00:50.239> yes<00:00:51.170> the

buttload of ancient sites for this app
but<00:01:03.109> I<00:01:03.139> just<00:01:03.289> got<00:01:03.440> given<00:01:03.619> advice<00:01:03.979> apparently

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
but I just got given advice apparently

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.100 
but I just got given advice apparently
the<00:01:04.640> easy<00:01:04.820> way<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.120> walk<00:01:05.330> up<00:01:05.480> these<00:01:05.660> steps<00:01:05.930> is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the easy way to walk up these steps is

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.170 
the easy way to walk up these steps is
sideways<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.800> zigzag<00:01:07.040> apparently<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.090> make

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
sideways in a zigzag apparently and make

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.680 
sideways in a zigzag apparently and make
the<00:01:08.330> trip<00:01:08.480> easier

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.120

yeah no that was that was just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.510 
yeah no that was that was just
as<00:01:13.250> hard<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.260> I<00:01:15.350> got<00:01:15.470> dizzy<00:01:15.619> I'm<00:01:16.220> one<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
as hard and I got dizzy I'm one of the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.950 
as hard and I got dizzy I'm one of the
strange<00:01:16.820> things<00:01:16.909> about<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:17.330> civilization

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
strange things about this civilization

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960 
strange things about this civilization
is<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.229> idea<00:01:18.650> they<00:01:18.799> had<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.100> beauty<00:01:19.460> basically

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
is the idea they had of beauty basically

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.430 
is the idea they had of beauty basically
anything<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.509> looked<00:01:20.690> really<00:01:20.990> different

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
anything that looked really different

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.499 
anything that looked really different
was<00:01:21.530> considered<00:01:21.950> beautiful<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.060> example

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
was considered beautiful so for example

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:24.850 
was considered beautiful so for example
when<00:01:23.630> babies<00:01:24.020> were<00:01:24.140> born<00:01:24.290> they<00:01:24.500> might<00:01:24.680> put

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
when babies were born they might put

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.770 
when babies were born they might put
boards<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.280> either<00:01:25.460> side<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.390> head<00:01:26.540> so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
boards on either side of the head so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.969 
boards on either side of the head so
that<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.930> skull<00:01:27.290> would<00:01:27.380> develop<00:01:27.649> into<00:01:27.860> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
that the skull would develop into a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.260 
that the skull would develop into a
deformed<00:01:28.490> shape<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:28.940> was<00:01:29.030> considered

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
deformed shape and it was considered

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.850 
deformed shape and it was considered
amazing<00:01:29.840> basically<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:30.619> would<00:01:30.740> consider

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
amazing basically what we would consider

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.649 
amazing basically what we would consider
a<00:01:31.130> freakshow<00:01:31.490> back<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.300> day<00:01:32.420> they

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
a freakshow back in the day they

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.680 
a freakshow back in the day they
considered<00:01:33.049> it<00:01:33.110> beautiful<00:01:34.450> wish<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.570> lived

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
considered it beautiful wish I lived

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.530 
considered it beautiful wish I lived
back<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> day<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.640> now<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:37.940> one<00:01:38.210> example

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
back in the day and now just one example

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.450 
back in the day and now just one example
of<00:01:38.720> how<00:01:38.930> impressive<00:01:39.229> these<00:01:39.470> sites<00:01:39.770> are<00:01:39.950> each

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
of how impressive these sites are each

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.880 
of how impressive these sites are each
face<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.060> pyramid<00:01:41.509> has<00:01:41.659> 91<00:01:41.990> steps<00:01:42.470> which

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
face of this pyramid has 91 steps which

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.609 
face of this pyramid has 91 steps which
when<00:01:43.039> multiplied<00:01:43.490> by<00:01:43.520> its<00:01:43.789> full<00:01:44.000> sides<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.619> 364

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
when multiplied by its full sides is 364

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.529 
when multiplied by its full sides is 364
when<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.160> add<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.789> final<00:01:47.149> step<00:01:47.360> from

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
when you add that to the final step from

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.080 
when you add that to the final step from
the<00:01:47.630> top<00:01:47.810> platform<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.470> makes<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.800> 365<00:01:49.670> the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the top platform that makes it 365 the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.279 
the top platform that makes it 365 the
number<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.390> days<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.840> year

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
number of days in a year

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.109 
number of days in a year
there<00:01:51.649> are<00:01:51.740> also<00:01:51.860> nine<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.369> these<00:01:52.490> large<00:01:52.759> steps

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
there are also nine of these large steps

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.639 
there are also nine of these large steps
and<00:01:53.330> when<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.450> multiply<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.140> by<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.380> two

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and when you multiply that by the two

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.100 
and when you multiply that by the two
sides<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.310> get<00:01:55.490> 18<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.330> number<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.690> months<00:01:57.050> in

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
sides you get 18 the number of months in

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.840 
sides you get 18 the number of months in
the<00:01:57.229> Mayan<00:01:57.530> calendar<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.280> axis<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the Mayan calendar the axis of the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.490 
the Mayan calendar the axis of the
pyramid<00:01:59.240> also<00:01:59.420> relate<00:01:59.810> directly<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.319> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
pyramid also relate directly to the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100 
pyramid also relate directly to the
solstices<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.250> equinoxes<00:02:01.690> yeah<00:02:02.690> I<00:02:02.720> know

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
solstices and equinoxes yeah I know

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.590 
solstices and equinoxes yeah I know
kiss-off<00:02:04.039> anyway<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.940> ancient<00:02:05.330> sites<00:02:05.479> of

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
Mexico got a little overwhelming with

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.169 
Mexico got a little overwhelming with
