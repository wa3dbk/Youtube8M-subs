00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
one I showed off its kind of thing I was

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
one I showed off its kind of thing I was
working<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.019> some<00:00:10.380> stairs<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:11.099> would

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
working on of some stairs which would

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.070 
working on of some stairs which would
appear<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.120> retract

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.790 

in<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.800> out<00:00:20.920> as<00:00:21.250> for<00:00:21.940> use<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.800> stairs

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
in and out as for use of the stairs

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.160 
in and out as for use of the stairs
towards<00:00:24.250> Dumbledore's<00:00:24.700> office<00:00:24.850> and<00:00:28.110> show<00:00:29.110> you

up<00:00:29.290> them<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.470> work<00:00:29.590> very<00:00:29.770> well<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.099> I<00:00:30.900> was

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
up them to work very well and I was

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.150 
up them to work very well and I was
recording<00:00:32.230> like<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.680> last<00:00:32.830> video<00:00:32.950> I<00:00:33.070> also

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
recording like the last video I also

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.229 
recording like the last video I also
figured<00:00:33.370> out<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:33.580> way<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.850> I<00:00:33.910> can<00:00:33.970> make<00:00:34.120> them

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
figured out a way that I can make them

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.090 
figured out a way that I can make them
smaller<00:00:34.570> which<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.500> hard<00:00:35.710> on<00:00:35.860> that<00:00:35.950> now

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
smaller which is hard on that now

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.520 
smaller which is hard on that now
instead<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.430> having<00:00:36.489> all<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.780> wiring<00:00:37.960> coming

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
instead of having all the wiring coming

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.290 
instead of having all the wiring coming
out<00:00:38.650> on<00:00:38.800> an<00:00:38.890> extra<00:00:39.220> block<00:00:39.400> outside<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
out on an extra block outside of the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.720 
out on an extra block outside of the
area<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.800> way<00:00:41.980> it's<00:00:42.129> done<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.430> could

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
area because the way it's done I could

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.410 
area because the way it's done I could
just<00:00:42.879> have<00:00:43.269> it<00:00:43.420> right<00:00:43.960> right<00:00:44.379> in<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:46.059> built

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
just have it right right in and built

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.780 
just have it right right in and built
into<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.720> seven<00:00:46.960> by<00:00:47.019> seven<00:00:47.340> cube<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:50.790> kind

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
into the seven by seven cube and I kind

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.410 
into the seven by seven cube and I kind
of<00:00:51.820> Miss<00:00:51.970> remember<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.330> and<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:54.150> if<00:00:55.150> I<00:00:55.360> can

I'm<00:04:59.590> not<00:04:59.650> sure<00:05:00.150> about<00:05:01.150> one<00:05:01.720> way<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.900> do<00:05:02.050> this

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
I'm not sure about one way to do this

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.050 
I'm not sure about one way to do this
kind<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.650> area<00:05:02.860> I'm<00:05:03.370> going<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.639> make<00:05:03.729> just<00:05:03.880> come

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
kind of area I'm going to make just come

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.270 
kind of area I'm going to make just come
big<00:05:04.720> network<00:05:05.199> of<00:05:05.350> tunnels<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.919> can<00:05:06.010> get<00:05:06.130> lost

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
big network of tunnels you can get lost

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.279 
big network of tunnels you can get lost
in<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.699> be<00:05:06.789> honest

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.859 

then<00:05:12.860> owais<00:05:13.099> isn't<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:14.029> working<00:05:14.210> this

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:14.869 
then owais isn't really working this

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:16.059 
then owais isn't really working this
shouldn't<00:05:15.110> happen<00:05:15.259> like<00:05:15.469> this<00:05:15.529> on<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.800> actual

a<00:05:24.889> lot<00:05:25.069> to<00:05:25.219> load<00:05:25.430> so<00:05:25.699> it<00:05:25.729> does<00:05:25.999> bug<00:05:26.360> out<00:05:26.509> a

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
a lot to load so it does bug out a

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.399 
a lot to load so it does bug out a
couple<00:05:26.749> of<00:05:26.839> times<00:05:28.659> one<00:05:29.659> of<00:05:29.749> the<00:05:29.809> major<00:05:29.990> they<00:05:30.199> do

couple of times one of the major they do

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.869 
couple of times one of the major they do
is<00:05:30.529> starting<00:05:30.949> to<00:05:31.039> finish<00:05:31.279> bunting<00:05:31.639> all<00:05:31.759> these

trees<00:05:32.860> skating<00:05:33.860> I<00:05:33.949> think<00:05:34.159> it's<00:05:34.279> just<00:05:34.339> this<00:05:34.749> one

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
trees skating I think it's just this one

trees skating I think it's just this one
area<00:05:35.990> left<00:05:36.559> to<00:05:36.740> do<00:05:36.919> or<00:05:37.279> trees<00:05:38.319> then<00:05:39.319> get<00:05:39.499> to

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.649 
area left to do or trees then get to

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:41.719 
area left to do or trees then get to
load

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729
