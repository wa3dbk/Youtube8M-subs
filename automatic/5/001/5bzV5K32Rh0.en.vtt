you<00:02:01.860> could<00:02:01.979> say<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.700> end<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.939> making

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
you could say that would end up making

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.310 
you could say that would end up making

other world war two base game world at
war<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.490> was<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.659> all<00:02:07.810> honesty<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.229> think

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
war and it was it in all honesty I think

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.139 
war and it was it in all honesty I think
that<00:02:08.709> most<00:02:09.009> people<00:02:09.369> feel<00:02:09.580> as<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> game

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
that most people feel as of the game

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.449 
that most people feel as of the game
fell<00:02:10.360> flat<00:02:10.660> because<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.890> many<00:02:12.040> games<00:02:12.250> had

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
fell flat because so many games had

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.339 
fell flat because so many games had
already<00:02:12.610> been<00:02:12.940> during<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.660> World<00:02:13.810> War<00:02:13.900> 2<00:02:14.110> time

already been during the World War 2 time

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.900 
already been during the World War 2 time
period<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.010> community<00:02:15.489> was<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.879> of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
period that the community was kind of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.089 
period that the community was kind of
exhausted<00:02:16.480> from<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.930> was<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.650> was<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.980> was

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
exhausted from it it was it was it was

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.030 
exhausted from it it was it was it was
all<00:02:18.220> drained<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.760> World<00:02:19.000> War<00:02:19.120> two<00:02:19.209> hike<00:02:19.599> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
all drained of World War two hike and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.680 
all drained of World War two hike and
that<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.370> when<00:02:21.519> world<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.849> war<00:02:22.060> comes<00:02:22.330> out<00:02:22.510> it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that so when world at war comes out it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.180 
that so when world at war comes out it
was<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.959> what's<00:02:23.290> what's<00:02:23.560> new<00:02:23.739> about<00:02:23.860> this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
was like what's what's new about this

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370 
was like what's what's new about this
and<00:02:24.400> on<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.360> right<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.870> angry<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.349> guess

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
and on that right to be angry I guess

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.440 
and on that right to be angry I guess
you<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.680> say<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.700> fell<00:02:27.880> flat<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.239> of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you can say and it fell flat because of

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.970 
you can say and it fell flat because of
that<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.019> developers<00:02:29.470> trailer<00:02:29.799> they

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
that and the developers trailer they

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.940 
that and the developers trailer they
knew<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.450> would<00:02:31.660> be<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> safer<00:02:32.349> bet<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.799> go

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
knew that it would be a safer bet to go

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
knew that it would be a safer bet to go
with<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.549> post<00:02:34.060> modern<00:02:34.299> or<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> modern

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
with a on post modern or a modern

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.559 
with a on post modern or a modern
shooter<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:35.950> they<00:02:36.130> didn't<00:02:36.519> another<00:02:36.880> my

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
shooter but they didn't another my

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.750 
shooter but they didn't another my
theory<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.890> they<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
theory is that they really have a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.449 
theory is that they really have a
passion<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.450> say<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:40.959> past<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.890> developers

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
passion to say in past the developers

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.430 
passion to say in past the developers
really<00:02:42.700> like<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.329> studio<00:02:43.690> feels<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.349> bit

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
really like it the studio feels a bit

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.199 
really like it the studio feels a bit
more<00:02:44.590> comfortable<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.280> now<00:02:45.760> how<00:02:46.060> do<00:02:46.120> I
