00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610

 the mini map, etc. to be able to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 install the various wii present online 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 you need this raf manager file 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 the same as we used to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.229
 install tencent mode and files 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.559
 indeed of one of the files of the wii that vi 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.790
 will like it better to find these wii 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 you will have to go to the link you leave me in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.040
 description which is the site of there kraft 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.460
 in the eu area 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.500
 here you will do search you will write not 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.299

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.890
 from the various players what I am 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.649
 I will also show the fox in the game today 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.880
 on vip 2.0 because the one I like 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.549
 more 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.549
 will this be then we pass 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.469
 installation I state that this will be 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.729
 specific installation of a mod 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.619
 the fox v 2.0 with the advent see first 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.130
 I think that in the other recordings it will be 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.960
 similar, however, I am not sure that this is so 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 so if you have problems with others 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.179
 mode write it in the comments and I'll try 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.429
 install them myself my pc and if not 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.409
 will work or if I find the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.539
 solution I will say now we pass 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:56.069
 real installation drag 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:57.530
 the file on the desktop open it ok arrive 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.140
 Up to this folder that the free 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.799
 I would find you have two choices 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.719
 from 1920 x 1080 the clay 1920 x 1080 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.020
 smooth of the small map will be 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.150
 slightly smaller than in 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.310
 the one you have with normal wii 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 instead it was the bank but then it will be the same 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.290
 therefore for the players who have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.390
 used the normal wii for a long time 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.060
 this was a little annoying 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.430
 for this I recommend you will use large 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.640
 so open raf manager already 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.800
 open because the live gods open it 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.190
 problems since very slow more 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.170
 dragged from 1920 x 1080 large or 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.600
 to 1920 1080 small in russ meyer 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.590
 when he dragged her on that cock 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.060
 the one below does still don 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:00.380
 put the name this way 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.380
 we will call fox which 2.0 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:12.690
 lg click ok click on many 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.330
 check enable us who file and do pac 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:22.280
 as soon as you finish installing you will have 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:27.269
 league of legends and now I'll start one 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:31.380
 small custom to let you see how it is 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.299
 changed the wii to later 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.980
 here we are guys in the home button e 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:42.079
 how do you see the very country wii is 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.079
 completely different from the normal one 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.519
 all in a darker outline than the image 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.959
 place that be in the upper left corner if 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.870

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.780

 in the other video also the shopper 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.790

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.570
 nice is the video could also end 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.190

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:52.460

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.740
