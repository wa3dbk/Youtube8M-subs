00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay so today we have a pulley shawl so

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay so today we have a pulley shawl so
sometimes<00:00:04.110> you'll<00:00:04.380> see<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.740> that's<00:00:04.890> down

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
sometimes you'll see that that's down

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.730 
sometimes you'll see that that's down
here<00:00:05.520> if<00:00:06.089> that's<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.509> case<00:00:06.720> we'll<00:00:07.500> go<00:00:07.620> ahead

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
here if that's the case we'll go ahead

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.820 
here if that's the case we'll go ahead
and<00:00:07.890> use<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.370> same<00:00:08.840> spatula<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.380> use<00:00:10.559> for

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
and use the same spatula that we use for

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.279 
and use the same spatula that we use for
the<00:00:10.889> white<00:00:11.070> starter<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.300> pool<00:00:12.509> eesh

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.560 

one<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.560> don't<00:00:16.740> want<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:18.000> go

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
one thing you don't want to do is go

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
one thing you don't want to do is go
from<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> pool<00:00:19.439> eesh<00:00:19.650> back<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> white

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
from the pool eesh back to the white

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.070 
from the pool eesh back to the white
starter<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.689> don't<00:00:21.840> want<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
starter you don't want to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.230 
starter you don't want to
cross-contaminate<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:23.130> way<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:24.060> this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
cross-contaminate that way because this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
cross-contaminate that way because this
is<00:00:24.420> made<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.630> commercial<00:00:25.350> yeast<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
is made with commercial yeast and the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730 
is made with commercial yeast and the
starters<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.150> made<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.449> natural<00:00:27.660> yeast<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
starters are made with natural yeast and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.859 
starters are made with natural yeast and
we<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.760> okay<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> natural

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
we want it's okay to get the natural

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.740 
we want it's okay to get the natural
yeast<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> commercial<00:00:32.009> yeast<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.520> not

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
yeast in the commercial yeast but not

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
yeast in the commercial yeast but not
the<00:00:33.750> vice<00:00:33.899> versa<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.739> always<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> foolish

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the vice versa so always do the foolish

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.830 
the vice versa so always do the foolish
last<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> same<00:00:38.250> thing<00:00:38.570> we<00:00:39.570> start

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
last and that's the same thing we start

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
last and that's the same thing we start
with<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.590> water<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.100> been<00:00:41.309> already

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
with some water that's been already

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
with some water that's been already
scaled<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> bucket<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.050> just

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
scaled out in the bucket and we're just

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
scaled out in the bucket and we're just
going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> add<00:00:43.620> some<00:00:43.950> flour<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.850> bucket

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
going to add some flour to that bucket

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.869 
going to add some flour to that bucket
and<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.379> labeled<00:00:46.649> over<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.340> French<00:00:47.730> school

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and it's labeled over here French school

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
and it's labeled over here French school
eesh<00:00:48.950> gonna<00:00:49.950> take<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> flour<00:00:51.649> dump<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> into

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
eesh gonna take that flour dump it into

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.959 
eesh gonna take that flour dump it into
the<00:00:53.270> bucket<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:58.680> cool<00:00:59.430> eesh<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:02.550> even

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the bucket and this cool eesh is even

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
the bucket and this cool eesh is even
more<00:01:03.239> difficult<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> white<00:01:04.350> starter

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
more difficult than the white starter

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
more difficult than the white starter
because<00:01:05.960> there<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.470> higher<00:01:08.130> proportion<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
because there is a higher proportion of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.450 
because there is a higher proportion of
flour<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.930> water<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:12.240> guy<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
flour to water in here so this guy is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.350 
flour to water in here so this guy is
really<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.119> um<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:17.030> stiffer<00:01:18.030> than

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
really a little um a little stiffer than

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
really a little um a little stiffer than
the<00:01:18.689> white<00:01:19.470> starter<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> see

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the white starter you can kind of see

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
the white starter you can kind of see
that<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> dough<00:01:23.280> than

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that it's more of a kind of a dough than

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.050 
that it's more of a kind of a dough than
a<00:01:23.970> batter<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.189> takes<00:01:26.549> more

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a batter and so it just takes more

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.590 
a batter and so it just takes more
effort<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:28.080> stir<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.070> thing<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
effort to stir this thing up and you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830 
effort to stir this thing up and you
just<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:33.119> kind<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
just want to take your time and kind of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.620 
just want to take your time and kind of
turn<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> bucket<00:01:34.350> manually<00:01:35.159> dig<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
turn the bucket manually dig in down to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.740 
turn the bucket manually dig in down to
the<00:01:36.750> bottom<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:38.040> across<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.579> bottom<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the bottom go across the bottom and the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
the bottom go across the bottom and the
sides<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> mix<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.180> like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
sides and just kind of mix it up like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.889 
sides and just kind of mix it up like
that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.109 
that
and<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:45.060> long<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.990> any<00:01:47.930> flour

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
and as long as you don't see any flour

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.969 
and as long as you don't see any flour
anywhere<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> should<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.810> okay<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
anywhere then you should be okay and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800 
anywhere then you should be okay and
then<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> scrape<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
then you just want to scrape down the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.730 
then you just want to scrape down the
sides<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.790> grab<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.210> white<00:01:58.140> starter

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sides and then grab your white starter

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
sides and then grab your white starter
or<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.100> white<00:02:00.860> scraper<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.509> ahead<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
okay so that's the white starter rice

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.710 
okay so that's the white starter rice
starter<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> pool<00:02:25.460> eesh<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.240> one<00:02:26.270> day
