00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.810 
shoot out a little bit more if I want to
come<00:01:26.650> down<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:26.860> if<00:01:27.130> you've<00:01:27.220> gone<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.610> high

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
come down so if you've gone to high

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.240 
come down so if you've gone to high
sheet<00:01:28.210> out<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.540> start<00:01:28.810> dropping<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:30.040> start

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
sheet out to start dropping as you start

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.680 
sheet out to start dropping as you start
to<00:01:30.340> drop<00:01:30.550> there<00:01:30.730> you<00:01:30.820> want<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.060> sheet<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.420> again

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
to drop there you want to sheet in again

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.120 
to drop there you want to sheet in again
and<00:01:31.900> you're<00:01:32.110> gonna<00:01:32.200> pull<00:01:32.500> on<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.680> forward

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
and you're gonna pull on the forward

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.610 
and you're gonna pull on the forward
hand<00:01:33.510> pulling<00:01:34.510> on<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.780> forward<00:01:35.020> hand<00:01:35.380> will

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
hand pulling on the forward hand will

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.140 
hand pulling on the forward hand will
start<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.010> dive<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.400> kite<00:01:36.580> again<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.000> it's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
start to dive the kite again so it's

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.730 
start to dive the kite again so it's
gonna<00:01:37.240> go<00:01:37.420> over<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.750> 12<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.350> then<00:01:38.470> start

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
gonna go over to 12 and then start

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.620 
gonna go over to 12 and then start
diving<00:01:39.070> down<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.340> window<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.330> actually

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
diving down the window and it's actually

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.330 
diving down the window and it's actually
gonna<00:01:40.750> create<00:01:40.960> additional<00:01:41.620> lift<00:01:41.830> as<00:01:42.040> well<00:01:42.220> as

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
gonna create additional lift as well as

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.520 
gonna create additional lift as well as
for<00:01:42.550> momentum<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.630> allows<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.230> land<00:01:44.409> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
for momentum this allows you to land a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.380 
for momentum this allows you to land a
little<00:01:44.740> bit<00:01:44.860> softer<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.370> also<00:01:45.790> with<00:01:46.150> more

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
little bit softer but also with more

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.180 
little bit softer but also with more
speed<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.960> keeps<00:01:47.230> you<00:01:47.440> from<00:01:47.680> hitting<00:01:48.070> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
speed this keeps you from hitting the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.800 
speed this keeps you from hitting the
water<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.700> then<00:01:48.850> stalling<00:01:49.210> out<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.450> sinking

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
water and then stalling out and sinking

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.000 
water and then stalling out and sinking
because<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.140> want<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.409> land<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:50.920> then

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
because you want to land and then

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.800 
because you want to land and then
continue<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.460> ride<00:01:51.670> away<00:01:51.909> from<00:01:52.180> it<00:01:52.330> now

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
continue to ride away from it now

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.540 
continue to ride away from it now
something<00:01:53.380> very<00:01:53.590> important<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.040> keep<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.280> mind

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
something very important to keep in mind

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.430 
something very important to keep in mind
is<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.940> if<00:01:55.120> you're<00:01:55.420> extremely<00:01:55.690> high<00:01:56.170> if<00:01:56.409> you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
is that if you're extremely high if you

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.890 
is that if you're extremely high if you
did<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.650> really<00:01:57.010> big<00:01:57.220> jump<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.120> actually<00:01:58.690> want

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
did a really big jump you actually want

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.360 
did a really big jump you actually want
to<00:01:58.960> feather<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.320> kite<00:01:59.530> back<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.040> forth<00:02:00.250> a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
to feather the kite back and forth a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.530 
to feather the kite back and forth a
little<00:02:00.430> bit<00:02:00.640> more<00:02:00.880> until<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.150> get<00:02:01.300> little<00:02:01.420> bit

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
little bit more until you get little bit

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.890 
little bit more until you get little bit
closer<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.140> water<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:04.270> as<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.600> continued

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
closer to the water now as it continued

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.120 
closer to the water now as it continued
to<00:02:04.930> get<00:02:05.050> closer<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.440> closer<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.830> water<00:02:06.040> I

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
to get closer and closer to the water I

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.009 
to get closer and closer to the water I
pull<00:02:06.430> harder<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.120> harder<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.720> forward

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
pull harder and harder on that forward

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.779 
pull harder and harder on that forward
hand<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.349> really<00:02:08.799> want<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.099> kite<00:02:09.310> diving

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
hand you really want that kite diving

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.360 
hand you really want that kite diving
alright<00:02:10.689> so<00:02:10.840> I'm<00:02:10.929> spotting<00:02:11.200> my<00:02:11.409> landing<00:02:11.889> I'm

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
alright so I'm spotting my landing I'm

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.770 
alright so I'm spotting my landing I'm
going<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.579> land<00:02:12.760> back<00:02:12.969> foot<00:02:13.239> first

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
going to land back foot first

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.020 
going to land back foot first
feel<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> water<00:02:14.290> okay<00:02:15.010> back<00:02:15.310> foot<00:02:15.610> hit<00:02:15.760> first

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
feel the water okay back foot hit first

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.970 
feel the water okay back foot hit first
now<00:02:16.690> look<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.020> kite<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.260> only<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.620> thirty

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
now look the kite is only about thirty

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.920 
now look the kite is only about thirty
degrees<00:02:18.160> above<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> horizon<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.810> right

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
degrees above the horizon all right

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.850 
degrees above the horizon all right
let's<00:02:20.080> go<00:02:20.170> ahead<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.380> take<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.500> look<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.770> this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
let's go ahead and take a look at this

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.330 
let's go ahead and take a look at this
from<00:02:21.010> another<00:02:21.220> perspective<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.830> again<00:02:24.100> coming

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
into this with really good speed and I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.449 
into this with really good speed and I
want<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.110> make<00:02:26.200> sure<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.380> have<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> loaded<00:02:26.980> bar<00:02:27.190> so

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
want to make sure I have a loaded bar so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that the bars pretty far sheeted out and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180 
that the bars pretty far sheeted out and
again<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.600> loaded<00:02:31.900> bar<00:02:32.230> now<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:33.130> you
