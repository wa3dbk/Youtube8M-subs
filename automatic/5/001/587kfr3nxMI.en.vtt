00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.440
 anthrax is designed as a search 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 predator in large areas so for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.380
 his will local places by the windows among 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.740
 algae here he works 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740
 even better 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.470
 to join 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 fish fishing though there is no dilapidated 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.870
 covenants 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.300
 everything happens usually spontaneously but 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.250
 just one pattern worked now 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.050
 when they move atmospheric masses on 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.090
 pond full calm works 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.820
 lures that imitate just 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.010
 some stir fussing on the surface 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
 the fish at this moment is not very 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 active and applies to all prim he there 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.619
 with great caution antrag here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.660
 fits very well because you can 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.729
 spend very very very slowly with 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.530
 lots of pauses and he always 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.420
 remains attractive to the predator 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.500
 plus his wagging movements 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:34.550
 ability to provoke even the most 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:36.080
 inactive zubatogo predator successful well 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.420
 now a few words about anthrax anthrax 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160
 This wobbler Well wobbler can say 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.960
 superficial its deepening is perfect 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.600
 slightly but with slow wiring 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.910
 it works strictly on the surface of the water 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.399
 perfect for fishing very much 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.520
 overgrown places like this in such in 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.479
 which we are now conducting 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.640
 it can be in several ways 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.130
 direct wiring slow stop end and go 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.899
 easy twitching which I prefer 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.550
 all other anthrax tips 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.179
 works great when slow 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.819
 twitching 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.489
 his forward movements are minimal 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.260
 wobbler well-unfolds from side 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.000
 to the side 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.310
 very useful to withstand pauses in order 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.590
 to predator had time to listen to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.250
 what happens on the water get out of cover 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 and attack the object 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:43.830
 here are my nerves as always turned out 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:46.980
 stronger than nerves positive trait 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.870
 lures and and realism even if 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.520
 predator pricked and treated with 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.680
 suspicion of everything that happens on 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.410
 water to persuade him to attack this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.840
 the bait is not difficult to gain 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.090
 patience and hold the bait very 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:15.270
 slowly with long pauses slightly 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:17.070
 shaking a wobbler interestingly grabbed 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.270
 very close to the boat 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.880
 Usually in stylish weather, pikes don't like to 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.290
 try to keep yourself close 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.700
 keep a distance well or if by 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 push walked close to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.770
 standing cheek then she is very very sluggish 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.740
 react to bait virtually no 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.360
 going out on them here it jumped out and where 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.730
 quite active with two turns 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.730
 beautiful straight summer 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.800
 when fishing for intermission all apply 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.700
 types of posting direct or uniform for 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.700
 predator search 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.879
 stop and go and classic twitching for 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.799
 his persuasions as well as various 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:17.019
 combinations of these entries are very effective 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.600
 slight movement of the bait on the surface 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.680
 water of course if a predator is discovered or 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.990
 there is a high probability 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.550
 finding him at the bait site 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.830
 appearance and coloring wobbler done 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.740
 in a way that mimics the dying 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.380
 better surface belly belly fish 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.210
 so light wiggling the bait on 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.490
 water surfaces give a big 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.800
 realistic death agony of fish 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.270
 and hit hard on one of the major 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.210
 predator instincts 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.630
 orderly forcing even a little active 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.740
 fish 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.740
 attack a wobbler 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:13.330
 calm and and that's about to throw bad 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:16.300
 pike as you can see anthrax very fighting 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.550
 bait pikes love her eat in any 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.660
 the weather can be said that this bait 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.860
 if not universal then at least 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.080
 multifunctional because its possible 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.570
 conduct in completely different ways and 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.570
 you can almost always pick one 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.280
 unique way of posting which in 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.280
 the final score and will bring the trophy
