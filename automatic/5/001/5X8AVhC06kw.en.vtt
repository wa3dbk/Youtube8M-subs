00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.890
 after searching channels 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
 We'll now configure the internet. 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 to unlock channels 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.039
 automatically by the function and ks and already 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:25.250
 comes configured by default is not 100 thousand 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.250
 my case underutilizing where even the rs 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:35.460
 Me too, next door. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.410
 I am setting up the internet and channels 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 London 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.910
 I found the home screen one more time less 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 the option is penultimate so I go there in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 down one step up that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.489
 imposes on the last 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 but a touch up on top of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.180
 expansion 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 here in a situation that will give 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:05.189
 choose the easiest option for who 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:10.729
 RS uses the adapter and the network found 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.729
 also that on the okay side and the password 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.850
 so your router 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.190
 the green key toggles between upper case and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.190
 lower case and some other symbols 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.330
 put it like this 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 wait until the device has received a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 ip address 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 the router is ready and exists until it appears 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 the channel list 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.280
 this point after a few seconds the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 unlock must be automatic 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.640
 some channels should already start to open 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:19.019
 immediately if it does not occur to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:20.640
 Can you see people download here? 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.120
 I restored the factory setting the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.830
 volume already comes in half 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.730
 if this does not happen if the channels do not 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.200
 open up right away we can be 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.600
 by checking some settings in the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.610
 the verification device such that the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.840
 since it was already received already 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.070
 ChÃ¡vez would be lowered menu already exists 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 here to leave Sa 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:56.660
 information - again last expansion 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.209
 server option a touch to the left 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.290
 for the server 40 to verify that the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:10.070
 server is connected and if we have 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.070
 the keys here all on the device 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.200
 lately I believe the system and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 ks is a bit unstable 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.230
 I believe you 're opening all the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.359
 channels so the best option is always to 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.359
 have a second antenna 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:37.499
 some channels usually opening who is 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 working alphabetically 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:44.939
 enjoying that we are here from 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:49.099
 button Channel list screen 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.099
 red that order 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:59.310
 put ok alphabetically and ready in 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.829
 60 coming I'm believing the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.439
 academic'm not giving up is 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:09.449
 opening up ready ground is this is a 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.079
 automatic configuration now we go 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.219
 make a specific configuration 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.609
 saying by a device that we want 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:24.019
 decoding is done by the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.019
 internet access key menu f1 key 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:36.270
 key f1 number 13 times father did not give 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:40.229
 right here f1 number 13 times and will 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.090
 appears on the screen is this 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.169
 moment we're going to put on the option 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.580
 6 activate internet 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.020
 ready now I have specified for 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.699
 device that I want to do 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.060
 decoding over the internet from 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:59.310
 this time the programs will start 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:03.120
 the channels being turned yellow . 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.860
 possibly decoded some 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.940
 channels may continue white but this is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.190
 normal 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.129
 remained open from the same 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.520
 Way even the ones that are white 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.520
 You will observe what is opening. 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.840
 Let's ask a little competitor, I'm going. 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.400
 close in the next video setting 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:38.229
 sds two antennas and some more 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.229
 bonus settings is the next video
