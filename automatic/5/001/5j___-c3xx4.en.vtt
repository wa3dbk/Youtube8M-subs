00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.879
 when an assembler launches a car of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 success 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.360
 usually the marketing staff soon 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.540
 asks to do a gt version but if 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.480
 you really want to make the gt 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:34.039
 problem is much more complex and renewed 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.039
 did this to create this fluence gt 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.920
 was added a turbo and 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:52.870
 of course all moving parts 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.290
 and many of the fixed parts and there I 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.059
 pistons brass spins break 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:05.420
 and the result was an engine that has 180 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.729
 horses and especially has a range of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 torque of more than thirty kilograms 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.560
 higher than that of all its 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.560
 competitors 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.270
 you also need to think about stopping the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.420
 car 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 ventilated disc brakes at the front and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 in the rear most modern version 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.360
 of the abs in the brake system 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.710
 with traction control control 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 stability 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.400
 we must also remember the suspension 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.140
 suspension that is adequate for 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.140
 convey that sense of security 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 However, this would not be enough if 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.840
 the meeting had not also looked at 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.490
 the front air bags safety part 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.610
 sides of curtain and finally the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.910
 possibility of a crash 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.170
 give total survival conditions 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 to its occupants 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.330
 this technological package costs 79 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.590
 thousand reais is a single version and in these 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.100
 conditions I believe is a 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.500
 powerful weapon in the Brazilian market and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.220
 With heart pain I'm going to give it back 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.970
 this car has reigned waiting for the moment 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.970
 to put one just like me and my guarantor
