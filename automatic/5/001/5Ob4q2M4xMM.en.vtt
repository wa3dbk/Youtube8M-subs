on the wall and I stare at them and you
know<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.150> decided<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.630> think

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
know and and decided you know if I think

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.469 
know and and decided you know if I think
you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.829> something<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:42.090> make<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you know we can do something to make it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
you know we can do something to make it
work<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.189> lineup

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
work and you know if that's a lineup

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.179 
work and you know if that's a lineup
that<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.290> win<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.530> that's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
that I think that we can win with that's
