essentially what this is is a very large

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.260 
essentially what this is is a very large
train<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.649> has<00:00:45.770> no<00:00:46.010> rails<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.090> rail<00:00:47.239> is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
train that has no rails and that rail is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.959 
train that has no rails and that rail is
not<00:00:47.420> attached<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:49.190> pretty<00:00:49.850> much

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
not attached to it and it pretty much

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.580 
not attached to it and it pretty much
brings<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:50.450> from<00:00:50.570> one<00:00:50.750> area<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.989> another<00:00:51.110> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
brings you from one area to another and

brings you from one area to another and
explained<00:00:52.460> as<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:52.940> start<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.239> ride<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:53.690> it's

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
explained as we start to ride but it's

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.770 
explained as we start to ride but it's
also<00:00:53.989> reversible<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:55.340> not<00:00:55.520> reversible<00:00:56.000> it's

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
though outside the train for us I'm fine

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.070 
though outside the train for us I'm fine
the<00:02:13.280> other<00:02:13.430> one<00:02:13.550> he's<00:02:13.640> going<00:02:13.760> crazy<00:02:13.819> I'm<00:02:14.150> I'm

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the other one he's going crazy I'm I'm

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.059 
the other one he's going crazy I'm I'm
having<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.620> joke<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.489> know<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:17.530> think<00:02:18.530> wait<00:02:18.800> six

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
having a joke you know I think wait six

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.530 
having a joke you know I think wait six
millimeters<00:02:19.610> per<00:02:19.730> second<00:02:20.030> or<00:02:20.090> whatever<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.450> is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
millimeters per second or whatever it is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.140 
millimeters per second or whatever it is
that<00:02:20.629> already<00:02:20.870> kappa<00:02:21.379> all<00:02:21.530> right<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that already kappa all right so

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.490 
that already kappa all right so
essentially<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.569> design<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.110> built<00:02:24.290> off<00:02:24.469> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
essentially this design is built off of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.970 
essentially this design is built off of
roll

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
roll

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.830 
roll
coasters<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.790> see<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.330> many

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
coasters if you see it on many

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.420 
coasters if you see it on many
rollercoasters<00:02:27.409> there<00:02:27.620> are<00:02:27.860> breaks<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
rollercoasters there are breaks in the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.039 
rollercoasters there are breaks in the
center<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.879> tracks<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.420> regulate<00:02:29.930> your

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
center of the tracks to regulate your

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.600 
center of the tracks to regulate your
speed<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.620> continue<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.280> ride

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
speed to continue the ride

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.190 
speed to continue the ride
so<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.030> don't<00:02:32.239> go<00:02:32.330> too<00:02:32.390> fast<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:33.049> slow

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so that you don't go too fast too slow

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.449 
so that you don't go too fast too slow
and<00:02:33.909> there's<00:02:34.909> a<00:02:35.000> sense<00:02:35.269> that's<00:02:35.540> how<00:02:36.110> these

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
and there's a sense that's how these

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.830 
and there's a sense that's how these
rails<00:02:37.459> are<00:02:37.610> kind<00:02:37.879> of<00:02:37.970> built<00:02:38.269> well<00:02:38.629> not<00:02:38.720> really

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
rails are kind of built well not really

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.420 
rails are kind of built well not really
rose<00:02:39.080> because<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.709> can<00:02:39.860> see<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.099> it's<00:02:40.280> not

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
rose because you can see that it's not

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.309 
rose because you can see that it's not
attached<00:02:40.670> at<00:02:40.879> all<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.959> actually<00:02:42.110> don't

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
attached at all and you actually don't

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.320 
attached at all and you actually don't
need<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.709> long<00:02:42.980> line<00:02:43.340> here<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.030> put<00:02:44.209> that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
need this long line here I just put that

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.339 
need this long line here I just put that
there<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.810> see<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.080> fast

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
there so you can see how fast

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.240 
there so you can see how fast
accelerates<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.540> beautiful<00:02:47.540> yeah<00:02:48.069> it's<00:02:49.069> very

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
accelerates and beautiful yeah it's very

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.780 
accelerates and beautiful yeah it's very
neo<00:02:49.519> knee<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.599> as<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.980> ahead<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.220> start<00:02:52.459> up

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
neo knee so as we go ahead and start up

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.180 
neo knee so as we go ahead and start up
this<00:02:53.660> doesn't<00:02:54.079> have<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.200> be<00:02:54.290> real<00:02:54.500> closer<00:02:54.739> oh

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
this doesn't have to be real closer oh

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:09.009 
this doesn't have to be real closer oh
god<00:02:55.459> no<00:02:55.640> no<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.610> bum<00:02:58.819> me<00:02:58.970> out<00:02:59.000> but<00:03:04.599> anyway<00:03:07.569> if<00:03:08.569> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
god no no you bum me out but anyway if I

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.979 
god no no you bum me out but anyway if I
can<00:03:09.410> try<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.590> catch<00:03:09.829> up<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.420> these<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.780> are

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
can try to catch up so what these do are

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.319 
can try to catch up so what these do are
they<00:03:12.230> slow<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.500> down<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.519> speed<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.030> is

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
they slow you down to a speed that is

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.839 
they slow you down to a speed that is
almost<00:03:14.629> stopping<00:03:15.349> kind<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.769> like<00:03:15.950> what<00:03:16.160> roller

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
almost stopping kind of like what roller

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.550 
almost stopping kind of like what roller
coasters<00:03:17.209> do<00:03:17.420> they<00:03:17.629> bring<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> speed

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
coasters do they bring in to a speed

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.630 
coasters do they bring in to a speed
that's<00:03:18.739> almost<00:03:19.069> stopping<00:03:19.430> then<00:03:19.549> they

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that's almost stopping then they

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.289 
that's almost stopping then they
continually<00:03:20.030> they<00:03:20.359> go<00:03:20.599> let<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.349> go<00:03:21.500> and

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
continually they go let you go and

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.699 
continually they go let you go and
that's<00:03:23.299> how<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.750> continues<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.319> move<00:03:24.440> at<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
that's how this continues to move at a

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.270 
that's how this continues to move at a
portable<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.760> unbel<00:03:26.540> pace<00:03:27.079> once<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.739> get<00:03:27.950> to

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
portable and unbel pace once you get to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.610 
portable and unbel pace once you get to
the<00:03:28.400> station<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.419> it's<00:03:29.569> very<00:03:29.660> safe<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.169> then

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
the station so it's very safe and then

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680 
the station so it's very safe and then
it<00:03:30.739> will<00:03:30.829> reverse<00:03:31.190> thanks<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.849> nice

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
it will reverse thanks to this nice

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.710 
it will reverse thanks to this nice
little<00:03:32.840> grata<00:03:33.109> Jenner<00:03:33.380> right<00:03:33.560> there<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.720> you

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
little grata Jenner right there and you

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.300 
little grata Jenner right there and you
will<00:03:35.870> continue<00:03:36.049> on<00:03:36.530> your<00:03:36.680> way<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.099> then<00:03:37.220> it

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
will continue on your way and then it

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.190 
will continue on your way and then it
will<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.519> keep<00:03:37.700> going<00:03:37.819> back<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.060> forth<00:03:38.209> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
will just keep going back and forth and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.190 
will just keep going back and forth and
I<00:03:39.349> what's<00:03:39.530> neat<00:03:39.650> about<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:41.480> was<00:03:41.750> speaking

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
I what's neat about this I was speaking

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.520 
I what's neat about this I was speaking
I<00:03:42.349> was<00:03:42.440> giving<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.829> monologue<00:03:43.959> okay

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
I was giving a monologue okay

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.589 
I was giving a monologue okay
so<00:03:45.950> what's<00:03:46.069> cool<00:03:46.190> about<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.910> yes<00:03:47.480> it

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
so what's cool about this is that yes it

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.839 
so what's cool about this is that yes it
is<00:03:47.690> two-way<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.319> can<00:03:48.440> also<00:03:48.590> continue<00:03:49.250> past

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
is two-way but it can also continue past

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.210 
is two-way but it can also continue past
two<00:03:50.329> different<00:03:50.780> stations<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.590> at<00:03:51.829> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
two different stations so if I at the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.309 
two different stations so if I at the
end<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.459> track<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.120> remove<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
end of this track if I you remove the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.059 
end of this track if I you remove the
the<00:03:55.310> block<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.940> reverses<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.540> ship<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.889> can

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
the block that reverses the ship you can

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.640 
the block that reverses the ship you can
pretty<00:03:58.790> much<00:03:58.880> continue<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.599> going<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.139> can<00:04:00.530> make

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
pretty much continue it going I can make

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.110 
pretty much continue it going I can make
a<00:04:00.680> longer<00:04:00.919> station<00:04:01.340> or<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.579> can<00:04:01.730> send<00:04:02.060> to

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
a longer station or you can send to

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.900 
a longer station or you can send to
another<00:04:02.389> station<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.900> passes<00:04:03.609> we<00:04:04.609> just<00:04:04.819> a

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
that block right there and you build

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.759 
that block right there and you build
like<00:04:10.599> more<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.629> those<00:04:11.810> guy<00:04:12.049> Jenner's<00:04:12.470> facing

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
like more of those guy Jenner's facing

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.440 
like more of those guy Jenner's facing
the<00:04:12.859> other<00:04:12.919> way<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.160> can<00:04:13.459> continue<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.180> track

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
the other way you can continue the track

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.879 
the other way you can continue the track
and<00:04:14.720> go<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.109> through<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:15.410> multiple<00:04:15.709> stations

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
and go it through like multiple stations

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.129 
and go it through like multiple stations
like<00:04:16.130> subway<00:04:16.489> type<00:04:16.760> thing<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> bullet

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
like subway type thing this is a bullet

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.860 
like subway type thing this is a bullet
train<00:04:18.289> because<00:04:20.349> yeah<00:04:21.349> what<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:23.690> does<00:04:24.169> right

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
train because yeah what that does right

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.750 
train because yeah what that does right
so<00:04:26.870> we<00:04:27.710> should<00:04:27.889> just<00:04:28.039> like<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:28.430> jump<00:04:28.639> off

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
so we should just like just jump off

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.000 
so we should just like just jump off
