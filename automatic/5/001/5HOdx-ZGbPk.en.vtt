straw<00:00:34.200> bale<00:00:34.410> chicken<00:00:34.829> shed<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> actually

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
straw bale chicken shed it's actually

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
straw bale chicken shed it's actually
one<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> better<00:00:37.290> straw<00:00:37.620> bale<00:00:37.829> structures

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
one of the better straw bale structures

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.869 
one of the better straw bale structures
I've<00:00:38.989> come<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.469> terms<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.879> its

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I've come up with in terms of its

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
I've come up with in terms of its
exactness<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> has<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.410> predator

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
exactness because it has to be predator

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.319 
exactness because it has to be predator
proof<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> other<00:00:44.789> structures

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
proof where the other structures

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
proof where the other structures
actually<00:00:46.320> were<00:00:46.440> open<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> time

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
actually were open all the time

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.350 
actually were open all the time
our<00:00:48.300> last<00:00:48.660> barn<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> our<00:00:49.469> cowshed<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
our last barn and our cowshed this one

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500 
our last barn and our cowshed this one
has<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:52.489> basically<00:00:53.489> areas<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
has to have basically areas all over the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
has to have basically areas all over the
place<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.020> block<00:00:55.260> predators<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.219> weasels

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
place to block predators up here weasels

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
place to block predators up here weasels
and<00:00:56.969> raccoons<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.859> foxes

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and raccoons could get in and then foxes

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.660 
and raccoons could get in and then foxes
down<00:00:59.550> below<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.840> doors<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
down below and I do put doors on the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.950 
down below and I do put doors on the
doors<00:01:02.670> reply<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.329> actually<00:01:03.420> warped

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
doors reply when they actually warped

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530 
doors reply when they actually warped
but<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:05.250> secure<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> door

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but they they secure right into the door

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.469 
but they they secure right into the door
itself<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> frame<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.650> they're<00:01:07.799> tight<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
itself the frame so they're tight and

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.969 
itself the frame so they're tight and
put<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.630> coping<00:01:10.020> around<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> sides<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
put some coping around the sides and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.929 
put some coping around the sides and
things<00:01:11.250> sort<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> gap<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.200> one

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
things sort of a gap there and this one

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.690 
things sort of a gap there and this one
just<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> hell<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> area

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
just because the hell of the the area

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.899 
just because the hell of the the area
made<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.630> off<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
made it a little bit off and but the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.310 
made it a little bit off and but the
fact<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.270> hell<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:21.960> makes<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
fact that hell is there makes it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
fact that hell is there makes it
impossible<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.979> something<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> push<00:01:23.580> its<00:01:23.729> way

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
impossible for something to push its way

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
impossible for something to push its way
in<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> hands<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.860> have

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
in so these are the hands that we have

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
in so these are the hands that we have
now<00:01:26.869> these<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> called<00:01:28.200> buff<00:01:28.470> Orpingtons

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
now these are called buff Orpingtons

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.660 
now these are called buff Orpingtons
which<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.549> specifically<00:01:30.390> good<00:01:30.630> for

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
which are specifically good for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
which are specifically good for
scratching<00:01:33.979> for<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.960> don't<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> call

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
scratching for I don't know if you call

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.149 
scratching for I don't know if you call
it<00:01:37.439> um<00:01:37.909> free-ranging<00:01:39.619> going<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.920> picking

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it um free-ranging going out and picking

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
it um free-ranging going out and picking
bugs<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.880> seeds<00:01:42.119> off<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> ground<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
bugs and seeds off the ground but the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
bugs and seeds off the ground but the
really<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.350> scratching<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> cows<00:01:44.220> dung<00:01:44.520> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
really good scratching the cows dung so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.460 
really good scratching the cows dung so
that's<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.840> things<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
that's one of the good things about the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
that's one of the good things about the
buff<00:01:46.649> Orpingtons<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.310> orange<00:01:47.610> coloured

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
buff Orpingtons these orange coloured

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.090 
buff Orpingtons these orange coloured
birds<00:01:48.329> some<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.140> birds<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.530> mixed<00:01:49.890> like

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
easily in the nest boxes which are here

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290

and they have access to them from the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.370 
and they have access to them from the
outside<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.520> what<00:02:50.640> they<00:02:50.760> sleep<00:02:51.030> on

what I guess called red star which is a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.520 
what I guess called red star which is a
good<00:02:59.370> late<00:02:59.550> end<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.600> well<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.170> we'll<00:03:01.320> probably

never have to buy eggs again which is a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.750 
never have to buy eggs again which is a
