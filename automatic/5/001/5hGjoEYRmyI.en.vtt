00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.950
 Chania, we are all with you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 and I have encountered such a problem already 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.160
 a few days ago in general I have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 computer startup was loading 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 pkm onion dot com very fucking crap and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.900
 I generally hate those who are 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 nonsense generally creates and creates general i 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 I show if someone has the same problem 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.899
 I will show you how all this garbage 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 clean and honestly on trees ass 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 Of course these people are fine so but for 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 start we need to see you mc 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.379
 config autoload through him we 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 let's see what we are loading and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.809
 under what names 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.829
 I was hiding it right now 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 show under ad now show it ad 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.820
 update there is something adobo update 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280
 startup people way here but I donâ€™t immediately 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 drew attention to the way he sought a common 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.580
 and it seemed that it was this one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.500
 garbage launches shortcut to the site vpk district 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 but first we need to remove it 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.299
 in general we can simply disable and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 to change 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.420
 now everything is now it does not boot anymore 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 will imagine a computer 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 but it 's not all for this we need 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.659
 also so that there is nothing more 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.700
 There was preferably remove 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.610
 This file is a total commander because 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 that when entering through an ordinary conductor I 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.649
 I can't find him there at all 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:53.000
 so but we go programm microsoft data 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.329
 windows start menu 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.549
 programs and he was hiding in my folder 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.350
 startup if not mistaken as to the start-up 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 these are more folders 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.090
 Now the same folder if you look through 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.750
 ordinary conductor and and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.489
 here we simply will not find even 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 display hidden files star game 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.860
 union is one and all 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 no therefore through the new commander everything 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 well removed by the way here already yes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.010
 here I have this shortcut here he has retired 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.470
 because autoload with us too 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 retired generally desirable to remove this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.510
 the folder is altogether perfect to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.180
 generally deleted and more I thought 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.299
 problem is the principle of loading you not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.980
 should be well, of course desirable 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.049
 for you to check in detail the conduct 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 that it starts at autoload 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.299
 and I think how exactly is there something you 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.170
 find what's under it 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.349
 bye corner 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.610
 I was the name of this garbage 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:02.060
 how is there then the updater is there something like that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.060
 check specific commands and what 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.160
 it is you who starts you will find by 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.470
 your at the end of the file is a reference 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.390
 will be launched well and in this way 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.140
 can be removed from the autoload this 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.120
 annoying site created well in general 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.549
 ok everyone, thanks for watching if 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.880
 helped will be glad to see in my video 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.880
