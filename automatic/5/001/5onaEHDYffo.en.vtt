00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's use for today's recipe 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 a picanha palmito salami sliced light 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.500
 yellow grated tomato cherry scent 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.260
 green bacon powdered oregano and salt to taste 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.449
 and you will also need paper 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.750
 aluminum and wood skewers 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.910
 I got a not so big picanha 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.160
 the procedure you did applied 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.049
 inverted is patience then what we 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 Let's do it and I need to do one 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.880
 envelope 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 I do not need one of a fine knife. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.470
 you avoid cutting the cut to the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.509
 outside because city escape you 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.409
 the letter opens what we are going to do 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.470
 Look slowly, do not you? 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 Are you following with your hair? 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 phone killed by the pilot by the drawing 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 what's going on here that I'm going 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 by the right side if I keep turning myself 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.430
 I'll open the envelope made then I 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.079
 I have to walk here I made a protection. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.170
 roughly two fingers on a finger 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.170
 me 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.950
 I got closer here 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.790
 Now you've been earning years. 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.690
 It's more or less two fingers, are you? 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.960
 also 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.620
 our concern is even that the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 she has to be a picanha that 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.410
 it is not right because it detailed 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.310
 she has some shreds, right? 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.980
 time you go and make her fill 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.470
 what will happen will escape 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.150
 so take a look just the system that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:26.500
 It's left out it's standing here I need 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.070
 open a little more, let's play 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.640
 zinho, right? 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.640
 I got to the tip 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.030
 well done that we need to do 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:49.190
 of a temperada from there by the part of 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.780
 It's out and it 's either or you prefer it too. 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.600
 you can do it one way is that you 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.330
 have skin inside after you 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.120
 it is advisable to temper by 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.100
 inside if you're going to do the seasoning 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.000
 as usually the staff does by the side 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.040
 out 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.660
 You put on accept it will be very 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.070
 smooth for your work 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.250
 ok so what do we do 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.680
 taking advantage of the fact that it is not us 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.560
 Let's start the process of turning it around. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 process 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:31.660
 the process that is a bit more 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.660
 takes now you have to pay 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.090
 Look how he became friends with you. 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.980
 pretty 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.760
 the man from home because the process now 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.450
 make the beautiful seasoning and stuff 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.580
 to do a full time here with cheese 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.630
 mozzarella rather type it Buxar 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.340
 let's put on green smell you know what 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.340
 Is this friend of the house thinking you are? 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.580
 cinnamon is not cinnamon, it's not the alley in 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.580
 powder of the year 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:27.250
 very little sauípe thing i'm going to 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:34.340
 put the sauce that we are going to make 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:36.770
 little palm heart looks a little bit 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.180
 already start with other seasonings, people 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:45.320

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.419
 A little bit here, some nice people. 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.419

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.800

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.710
