crow<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.709> Saturday<00:03:25.100> without<00:03:25.310> any<00:03:25.489> question<00:03:25.910> we

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
crow on Saturday without any question we

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.920 
crow on Saturday without any question we
were<00:03:26.930> much<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.320> better<00:03:27.500> team<00:03:27.709> but<00:03:28.780> I've<00:03:29.780> still

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
were much the better team but I've still

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.410 
were much the better team but I've still
got<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.170> problem<00:03:30.709> scoring<00:03:31.070> goals<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.300> last

got a problem scoring goals in the last

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.730 
got a problem scoring goals in the last
month<00:03:32.690> or<00:03:32.840> so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
month or so

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.550 
month or so
which<00:03:34.520> ultimately<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:35.150> suppose<00:03:35.480> cost<00:03:36.200> Richards

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
which ultimately I suppose cost Richards

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.890 
which ultimately I suppose cost Richards
job<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.280> mean<00:03:37.550> because<00:03:37.970> there's<00:03:38.780> been

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
job you know I mean because there's been

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.210 
job you know I mean because there's been
matters<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.290> have<00:03:39.410> been<00:03:39.530> very<00:03:39.710> close<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
matters that have been very close and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.330 
matters that have been very close and
we've<00:03:40.640> missed<00:03:40.850> opportunities<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.340> those

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
we've missed opportunities and those

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.280 
we've missed opportunities and those
those<00:03:43.730> drawers<00:03:44.210> and<00:03:44.570> defeats<00:03:44.990> could<00:03:45.200> have

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
those drawers and defeats could have

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.570 
those drawers and defeats could have
been<00:03:45.380> turned<00:03:45.560> into<00:03:45.770> victories<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.280> certainly

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
been turned into victories and certainly

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.940 
been turned into victories and certainly
exactly's<00:03:47.000> game<00:03:47.180> accrue<00:03:47.800> especially<00:03:48.800> when

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
exactly's game accrue especially when

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.860 
exactly's game accrue especially when
crew<00:03:49.640> went<00:03:49.850> down<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> ten<00:03:50.270> men<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.630> was<00:03:50.690> only

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
crew went down to ten men it was only

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.650 
crew went down to ten men it was only
gonna<00:03:51.020> be<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.350> winner<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.450> we<00:03:53.450> didn't

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
gonna be one winner but we didn't

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.200 
gonna be one winner but we didn't
possibly<00:03:54.020> create<00:03:54.620> enough<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.970> didn't

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
possibly create enough and we didn't

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.460 
possibly create enough and we didn't
take<00:03:56.330> me<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.660> couple<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:56.960> opportunities<00:03:57.440> that

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
take me a couple of opportunities that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.920 
take me a couple of opportunities that
we<00:03:57.620> had<00:03:57.830> in<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.040> game<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.720> consequently<00:03:59.720> they

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
we had in the game and consequently they

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.470 
we had in the game and consequently they
had<00:04:00.050> one<00:04:00.230> chance<00:04:00.530> at<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.250> end<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.820> they

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
had one chance at the end and they

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.780 
had one chance at the end and they
nicked<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.080> we<00:04:03.560> ended<00:04:03.740> up<00:04:03.890> with<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.130> with<00:04:04.760> a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
nicked it and we ended up with a with a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.150 
nicked it and we ended up with a with a
defeat<00:04:05.150> again<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.660> it's<00:04:06.530> just<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.800> side<00:04:07.010> of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
defeat again so it's just that side of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.410 
defeat again so it's just that side of
it<00:04:07.220> just<00:04:07.340> needs<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.670> improve<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.060> little<00:04:08.180> bit

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
it just needs to improve a little bit

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.450 
it just needs to improve a little bit
but<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.870> certainly<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.740> lot<00:04:09.920> of<00:04:10.010> talent<00:04:10.310> there<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
but I certainly a lot of talent there a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.940 
but I certainly a lot of talent there a
lot<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.670> good<00:04:10.820> footballers<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.680> not<00:04:12.800> like
