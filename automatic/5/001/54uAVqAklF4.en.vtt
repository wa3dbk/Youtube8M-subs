Rory<00:01:37.530> poker<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:37.979> call<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> point<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Rory poker would call the point of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.089 
Rory poker would call the point of
reference<00:01:38.819> that<00:01:39.119> point<00:01:39.599> is<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:40.679> we<00:01:40.860> pick<00:01:41.009> up

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
reference that point is where we pick up

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.230 
reference that point is where we pick up
the<00:01:41.250> trumpet<00:01:41.429> every<00:01:41.729> day<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> there's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the trumpet every day and there's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.529 
the trumpet every day and there's
something<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> might<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:44.119> that<00:01:45.119> gives<00:01:45.420> us

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
something that we might do that gives us

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.660 
something that we might do that gives us
a<00:01:45.569> sense<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.200> our<00:01:46.349> chops<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.860> quite

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
a sense of where our chops are quite

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.179 
a sense of where our chops are quite
quickly<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.890> from<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.069> so<00:01:52.189> after

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
quickly and we go from there so after

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
quickly and we go from there so after
I've<00:01:53.280> done<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.689> maybe<00:01:54.689> I'll<00:01:54.929> do<00:01:55.079> some

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

Jimmy<00:01:59.369> Stamp<00:01:59.729> exercises<00:02:01.310> or<00:02:02.310> maybe<00:02:02.520> I'll<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Jimmy Stamp exercises or maybe I'll just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.010 
Jimmy Stamp exercises or maybe I'll just
do<00:02:03.000> some<00:02:03.209> Caruso<00:02:03.689> studies<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.599> generally

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

sound where my sound is that day so I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.009 
sound where my sound is that day so I
won't<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.819> anything<00:02:15.030> too<00:02:15.269> complicated<00:02:15.480> to

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
not too stiff the other thing I do with

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.380 
not too stiff the other thing I do with
the<00:03:51.920> Caruso<00:03:52.310> usually<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:52.880> them<00:03:53.150> without

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
the Caruso usually I do them without

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.370 
the Caruso usually I do them without
vibrato<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:55.580> got<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.300> from<00:03:56.720> when<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.110> just

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
vibrato and I got that from when I just

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.370 
vibrato and I got that from when I just
had<00:03:57.530> one<00:03:57.709> lesson<00:03:58.010> with<00:03:58.280> duck<00:03:58.459> ship<00:03:59.000> sir<00:03:59.380> here

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
had one lesson with duck ship sir here

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.199 
had one lesson with duck ship sir here
in<00:04:00.500> Los<00:04:00.620> Angeles<00:04:00.650> he<00:04:01.190> gave<00:04:01.370> some<00:04:01.520> lessons<00:04:01.880> and

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
in Los Angeles he gave some lessons and

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.900 
in Los Angeles he gave some lessons and
I<00:04:03.200> played<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.739> he<00:04:03.830> says<00:04:04.069> why<00:04:04.550> do<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.730> play

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
I played and he says why do you play

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.630 
I played and he says why do you play
with<00:04:05.120> such<00:04:05.300> vibrato<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.830> all<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.160> time<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.580> I

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
with such vibrato and all the time and I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.970 
with such vibrato and all the time and I
said<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:08.060> was<00:04:09.019> thinking<00:04:09.320> at<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.560> time

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
said I was thinking at the time

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.740 
said I was thinking at the time
so<00:04:10.340> what<00:04:10.519> jeez<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.880> play<00:04:11.030> with<00:04:11.180> vibrato<00:04:11.510> all

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
so what jeez you play with vibrato all

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.960 
so what jeez you play with vibrato all
the<00:04:11.870> time<00:04:12.080> but<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.070> gave<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.430> some<00:04:13.459> thought<00:04:13.610> then

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
the time but I gave it some thought then

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.370 
the time but I gave it some thought then
I<00:04:14.000> realized<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.600> had<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.750> hard<00:04:14.989> time<00:04:15.140> controlling

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
I realized I had a hard time controlling

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.110 
I realized I had a hard time controlling
the<00:04:15.739> trumpet<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.160> playing<00:04:16.370> without<00:04:16.489> vibrato

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
the trumpet and playing without vibrato

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.270 
the trumpet and playing without vibrato
so<00:04:18.079> that's<00:04:18.320> when<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.500> got<00:04:18.560> serious<00:04:19.070> about

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
so that's when I got serious about

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.580 
so that's when I got serious about
playing<00:04:19.430> long<00:04:19.790> tones<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.329> being<00:04:21.320> able<00:04:21.440> to

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
playing long tones and being able to

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.150 
playing long tones and being able to
play<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.430> long<00:04:22.669> tone<00:04:23.050> without<00:04:24.050> vibrato<00:04:24.620> and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
play a long tone without vibrato and

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.730 
play a long tone without vibrato and
once<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.000> did<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.360> then<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.720> realized<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.470> I

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
once I did that then I realized that I

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.020 
once I did that then I realized that I
had<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.919> lot<00:04:28.160> more<00:04:28.340> control<00:04:28.640> over<00:04:28.729> the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
had a lot more control over the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.330 
had a lot more control over the
instrument<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.960> say<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.890> had

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
instrument that is I say that I had

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.530 
instrument that is I say that I had
control<00:04:31.610> over<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:32.000> instrument<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
control over the instrument and the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.469 
control over the instrument and the
instrument<00:04:32.570> didn't<00:04:33.169> have<00:04:33.260> control<00:04:33.620> over<00:04:33.650> me

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
instrument didn't have control over me

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.700 
instrument didn't have control over me
so<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:36.650> was<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> good<00:04:37.010> lesson<00:04:37.190> for<00:04:37.550> me<00:04:37.669> and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
so that was a good lesson for me and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.770 
so that was a good lesson for me and
probably<00:04:39.710> that's<00:04:40.220> enough<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.330> first<00:04:41.360> to

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
probably that's enough for the first to

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.730 
probably that's enough for the first to
go<00:04:41.990> around<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.470> my<00:04:42.970> attempt<00:04:43.970> at<00:04:45.430> doing<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.610> short

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
go around it my attempt at doing a short

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.140 
go around it my attempt at doing a short
session<00:04:48.740> on<00:04:49.010> YouTube<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.669> I<00:04:49.790> hope<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.030> find

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
session on YouTube and I hope you find
