00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the service people and welcome 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.029
 to my next tutorial in last 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.069
 time I have quite a lot on youtube 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 seen videos where people tried 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.809
 to explain how to get in four 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.139
 Making diamonds from cobblestone 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.420
 can 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.699
 However, I find that most of the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 just on the wrong away at 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.400
 have gone and thus is actually 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 such a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 I call it superstition 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 I was born many now 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 thinking that 's as good as impossible 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.880
 which of course is complete nonsense 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 I'll show you like you're here with 144 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.500
 cobblestone to make two diamonds 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 So you can simply'm talk 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 at the beginning in the box and then explained 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 So the whole society just here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.390
 with forest power it comes the cobblestone 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 out of the box in an essay of this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 pain the cobblestone to sand this 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.809
 sand then goes further here in one 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.610
 Auto he in an automatic workbench 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.500
 There sandstone is made from this sand 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.199
 cost that would be the same now 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.629
 so happened the first sandstone 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.960
 The sandstone comes to an end 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.560
 processed to smooth sandstone 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 and then get out of here so get out 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 this 144 cobblestone 36 sandstone because 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 but now it is an overclocker 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.159
 and three redstone engine its time 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.150
 I just need to spool it all the time 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.100
 We'll be back soon 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.180
 Everything should be ready and see here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.280
 we already have the 36 smooth sandstones 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 so if we go on it now then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 we see that this weird golden one 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 We need this mug in form here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.070
 Kraft will look at it for the basic 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 transmutation namely gold 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 make 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.040
 just that takes five to just this 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 Carus this mug and two metal around 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 then I have the whole thing now 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.230
 forget that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.820
 for that I apologize so upset 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.960
 Now we just need to travel 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.960
 That should not be a problem though 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.000
 We'll iron again later 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.220
 can produce from it however 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 I demonstrate to you that is easy 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.270
 Here I have a few kettles 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.820
 actually built up reaches very much 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.180
 Simply this new Eisenrhein where 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.730
 every 8 of this metal possesses around and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.520
 at this 36 years sandstone to then 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 with those with a magic wand on it and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.290
 then you get here 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.270
 We can get those gold nuggets out 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.080
 now in a crafting travel quite normal 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:46.150
 to a gold bar forces do that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.880
 me too fast so now we have 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.239
 Eight gold bars made from whole 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.950
 normal 144 stone and with that we can 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.720
 now do what we want we can 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.200
 For example, if we have no iron 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 have more 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.209
 with the mini umstadt mini um stein 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.360
 just a whole iron stack 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.130
 we produce from 9001 station 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.150
 made 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.580
 or we go and arrange the whole 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.489
 so here 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.540
 then we get two diamonds 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.049
 that's how we actually feel relative 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:26.019
 cheap devices from 144 coupled 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.700
 however, two diamonds are made 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.310
 we just need a little bit more 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.019
 However , we can see formcraft here 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.010
 that was pretty much the first thing I did 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.080
 I do not have everything here yet 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.700
 researching that's pretty much the first one 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.650
 what you can research on formcraft 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.420
 and with that you can already diamonds 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.459
 make and you have seen the video 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.980
 is not that long it actually is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.530
 I would say that pretty easy 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.820
 to make diamonds here 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.459
 So then I wish you much fun 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.390
 Try it yourself and say goodbye 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.890
 me here again 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.530
 thanks for watching if it's you 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.530
 the thumb goes up and down 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.530
 jazz
