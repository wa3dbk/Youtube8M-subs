00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.710 
this for about one minute to brew to the
correct<00:01:58.979> taste<00:01:59.610> if<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.120> leave<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.300> for<00:02:00.540> too

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
correct taste if we leave it for too

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.790 
correct taste if we leave it for too
long<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.620> bit

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
long it's going to get a little bit

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.020 
long it's going to get a little bit
bitter<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:05.880> those

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

ring<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.700> going<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:21.969> now<00:02:22.650> take<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.859> brute

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
ring so I'm going to now take this brute

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.949 
ring so I'm going to now take this brute
and<00:02:24.579> I'm<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.879> pour<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.209> into<00:02:25.359> this<00:02:25.540> char

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
and I'm going to pour it into this char
