00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.860
 welcome everyone i am happy 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:21.040
 the owner is the queen of the second model in 1 2 and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:24.070
 3 this is the old version of everything was five 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.020
 thousand genes for him was made at the base 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.130
 4 queens thanks to the design 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.190
 developed 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 the only Italians principle 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 axis day is not very tired design 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.370
 here I am straight 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.650
 painting completion you are not for nastya and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.560
 everything else basically fails 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.610
 hide age 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.940
 at the expense of good and technically 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.580
 I 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.510
 take 4 celica meets 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.550
 and the square is again wrong on slalom on 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.610
 the ring 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.070
 principle, there are few but fans of these 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.710
 machines try to support them more 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.280
 or less normal condition given 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.650
 instance 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.050
 I have known for almost 8 years 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.420
 almost everything as a theory and 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.690
 I have mastered the practice myself 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.650
 This car came to me from Germany 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.620
 was bought at auction ebay ie this 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 I was looking for a car about six months because 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.460
 that those instances that are found in 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.940
 us dead and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.030
 plan problem documents compound 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.880
 wanted the car to have one owner 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.490
 that there was not a bit and wanted top 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.140
 versions that is the most powerful motor 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.720
 for this machine from the factory 16 150 forces 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 leather interior all electric external 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.730
 almost did not have to recover 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.540
 only color changes are affected 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.120
 then it may change then shock 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.730
 optimists what that come across but it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.750
 beating baby 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.440
 u try so hard to go first there before 5000 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.069
 have it and so to go side by side 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.120
 these here again this 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.040
 Sport mode stage disc 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.000
 I see the machine was driving near so which 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.000
 special like mine 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.590
 and transfer where too so that 20 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.709
 Paris 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.709
 walk book 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.080
 changed upsets 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.330
 already thought that he would come near 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.830
 This copy of the plant was the most 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.570
 powerful motor for this body 16 and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.590
 157 when the car was bought this 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.140
 of course enough but time passes 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.390
 promotes the internet and appeared 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.670
 desire to shove something more interesting 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.670
 This series is the most powerful engine 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.980
 This is the engine with the right of cutting the Integer Odessa 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.530
 5 here at the factory 20 volume atmosphere 220 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.990
 horsepower on very interesting 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.680
 short 6-speed box with 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.709
 factory lock was shoved the most 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.010
 big motor principle is the smallest 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.260
 body stuffed it all in the garage 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.690
 which is clearly not even but for large 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.060
 desire, in principle, it is possible to eat with 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.590
 which machine 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.590
 39 for 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.650
 44 are sewed on the exhaust of our box on this 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.150
 carpenter all 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.150
 uninteresting better no no 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.940
 and we are an interesting opponent to 0 6 5 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.940
 at the convention 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.860
 waves of battle not on the same boxes 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.199
 tight firmware 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.889
 to 20 motor clean ponies g dm ovsky here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.720
 from native under the hood 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.900
 there was only a broad tank 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.750
 praise him everything else is not factory not 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.010
 factory no inlet no factory 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.260
 radiator cushions that hold the motor 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.570
 the box 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.540
 belt tensioner not factory fuel 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.310
 highway not factory main 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.910
 brake cylinder with vacuum not 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 Factory can respectively be seen 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.000
 kayloveri d2 set 1 port hello 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.460
 sleep with you again today mayor is yuri 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.449
 and Alexey Sulima want to have a little bit 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.930
 impressions about this wonderful 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.090
 car honda crx 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.220
 20 engine is atmospheric and the car 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.919
 really knocks thanks to higher Acne at 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.320
 I ride on this car 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.900
 emotions a lot a lot of emotions all 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.449
 really enjoyed it and after that our 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.550
 combat doesn't seem like some kind of super 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:27.450
 scrap metal does not go here it seemed 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.740
 would be 20 tons 25 but the difference is insanely higher 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.860
 difficult to put into words as far as 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.430
 big born precisely in dynamics 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.970
 car speakers 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.970
 the dawn 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.150
 The owner of the car I rolled very 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.909
 emotions were also very big such 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.659
 card in such a small go-kart which 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.610
 knocks just i want to thank such 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.710
 people who restore such 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.099
 rare cars this man put 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.569
 her soul is only an effort 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.069
 huge amount of money machine 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.449
 which we showed today is very 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.930
 good example on the car which 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.509
 having a small amount of motor is 20 and 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.240
 lightweight body here the car itself weighs 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.650
 about 900 kilograms and she goes that is 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.270
 on the basis of such a car you can 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.669
 build a car you are using 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.919
 maps of all you can fine tune 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.580
 get good dynamics in the zone 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.669
 controllability 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.569
 For comparison, here I have 25 when 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.039
 we started 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.870
 I felt like I was standing 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.300
 wanted to get out of the car and go go a 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.669
 I had a speedometer I do not know there 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.090
 140 and he left he left and BMW left 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.919
 cool but the Japanese are always such ore 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.529
 very interesting feeling in the car when 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.750
 after 160 she just doesn't even 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.060
 she does not press to accelerate that is she 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.599
 how dynamic how was wealth there she is 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.129
 will continue concerns after 160 and 180 yesterday 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.469
 in the area seen in the city here you 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.690
 ahead of us drove it is not hidden 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:18.360
 advertising man came real 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.539
 some in 40 maybe 50 that is he 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.680
 powerful machine tuned that knocks and 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.330
 he and restless here in the city of the future 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.510
 we have some more surprises for 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.250
 our viewers we 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.040
 let 's look at some interesting 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.290
 cars 1 if by the way two of them are bmw 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.850
 what we do not say so 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.030
 subscribe to the channel like 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:42.090
 repost everyone thanks everyone bye 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.690
 bye everyone 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.690
 so you say how already 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.409
 just share your emotions 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:57.260
 at least at the expense of the enemies quickly spruce 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:08:00.410
 very fast at all chic 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.860
 sometimes it is but so itâ€™s all inside 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.860
 shrinks
