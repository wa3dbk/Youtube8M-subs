what you've got is a pretty conventional

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.179 
what you've got is a pretty conventional
copperfin<00:00:05.819> baseboard<00:00:06.509> system<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:07.980> see

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
copperfin baseboard system you can see

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.770 
copperfin baseboard system you can see
there's<00:00:08.400> two<00:00:08.550> pipes<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.059> start<00:00:09.300> way<00:00:09.480> over<00:00:09.719> in

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
there's two pipes that start way over in

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.030 
there's two pipes that start way over in
the<00:00:09.809> corner<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.260> they<00:00:10.349> come<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.769> way<00:00:11.010> this

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
the corner and they come this way this

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.280 
the corner and they come this way this
is<00:00:11.250> copper<00:00:11.759> pipe<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.179> heating<00:00:12.719> water<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.170> it

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is copper pipe is heating water in it

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
is copper pipe is heating water in it
and<00:00:13.469> here's<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> fins<00:00:14.639> that's<00:00:14.910> going<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> heat

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
and here's the fins that's going to heat

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.660 
and here's the fins that's going to heat
up<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.719> air<00:00:15.900> now<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.740> water<00:00:17.250> goes<00:00:17.640> through

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
up the air now this water goes through

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.359 
up the air now this water goes through
the<00:00:17.970> pipe<00:00:18.270> all<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.830> elbow<00:00:20.039> right

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the pipe all the way to an elbow right

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.609 
the pipe all the way to an elbow right
here<00:00:20.430> goes<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.660> down<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.109> side<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
here goes all the way down that side of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.429 
here goes all the way down that side of
the<00:00:22.680> house<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.460> turns<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.150> comes<00:00:24.359> back<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the house it turns it comes back and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
the house it turns it comes back and
then<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> comes<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> way<00:00:26.279> back<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.760> way

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
then it comes all the way back this way

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
then it comes all the way back this way
now<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.750> happens<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.859> kind<00:00:29.039> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
now what happens is when this kind of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
now what happens is when this kind of
stalled<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> certain<00:00:30.960> length<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.410> when

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
stalled it was a certain length but when

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.229 
stalled it was a certain length but when
you<00:00:31.650> heat<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.189> pipe<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.700> wants<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> get

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you heat up a pipe it wants to get

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
you heat up a pipe it wants to get
longer<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.710> expand<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
longer how much can it expand to a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.020 
longer how much can it expand to a
hundred<00:00:36.600> feet<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.020> baseboard<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.460> raised<00:00:38.820> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
hundred feet of baseboard if I raised it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
hundred feet of baseboard if I raised it
by<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> hundred<00:00:39.360> degrees<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.050> would<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.320> almost

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
by a hundred degrees it would get almost

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
by a hundred degrees it would get almost
an<00:00:40.980> inch<00:00:41.250> longer<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.540> no

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
an inch longer so there's really no

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
an inch longer so there's really no
place<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.739> fixed<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
place for this to go it's fixed in that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
place for this to go it's fixed in that
corner<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.910> fixed<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.510> corner<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.930> look

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
corner it's fixed in this corner so look

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
corner it's fixed in this corner so look
what<00:00:46.170> happens<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.010> here

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
what happens you see this right here

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
what happens you see this right here
yeah<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.059> pipe<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> booed<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:49.860> it's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
yeah no this pipe is booed so now it's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
yeah no this pipe is booed so now it's
bowed<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> trying<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> hit<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> cover

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bowed out it's trying to hit this cover

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
need to do is give this copper pipe a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
need to do is give this copper pipe a
place<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> expand<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> got<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> couple<00:00:57.449> ways

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
place to expand and I got a couple ways

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
place to expand and I got a couple ways
to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> we'll<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.670> the

down<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> water<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.280> zone

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
down the water from just that one zone

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
down the water from just that one zone
let's<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.500> upstairs<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> baseboard

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
let's go back upstairs now the baseboard

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
let's go back upstairs now the baseboard
from<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> master<00:01:42.930> bedroom<00:01:42.960> continues<00:01:43.860> right

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
from the master bedroom continues right

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
from the master bedroom continues right
here<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> adjoining<00:01:45.119> office<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
here into the adjoining office and this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
here into the adjoining office and this
is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> point<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> told<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> returns

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is the point where I told you it returns

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
is the point where I told you it returns
back<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.210> itself<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.750> look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.920> has

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
back on itself so look at this this has

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
back on itself so look at this this has
actually<00:01:50.220> been<00:01:50.520> cut<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.090> long<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.869> it's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually been cut so long that it's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600 
actually been cut so long that it's
actually<00:01:52.290> touching<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.799> back<00:01:53.040> wall<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
actually touching this back wall that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.480 
actually touching this back wall that
means<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.329> got<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.689> room<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:54.990> expand<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.369> what

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
means it's got no room to expand so what

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.010 
means it's got no room to expand so what
I<00:01:56.549> want<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.450> shorten<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
I want to do is actually shorten the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
I want to do is actually shorten the
baseboard<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:59.040> one

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
baseboard I'm going to take about one

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
baseboard I'm going to take about one
inch<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.850> pipe<00:02:00.060> away<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.140> inch<00:02:01.320> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
inch of the pipe away and one inch of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
inch of the pipe away and one inch of
the<00:02:01.619> element<00:02:02.070> away<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.909> give<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the element away and actually give the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.619 
the element away and actually give the
baseboard<00:02:03.750> room<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.439> grow<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:09.030> give<00:02:09.179> myself<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
baseboard room to grow to give myself a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.270 
baseboard room to grow to give myself a
clean<00:02:09.929> place<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> cut<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> pipe<00:02:10.950> I'm<00:02:11.099> going<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
clean place to cut the pipe I'm going to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.790 
clean place to cut the pipe I'm going to
remove<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.790> these

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
remove some of these

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
remove some of these
from<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> heating<00:02:13.460> element<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.570> use

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
from the heating element now use

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.050 
from the heating element now use
aviation<00:02:15.500> snips<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.920> cut<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.640> aluminum

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.940 
aviation snips to cut the aluminum
alright<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.050> cut<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> bottom<00:02:18.560> pipe

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
alright I'm going to cut the bottom pipe

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.980 
alright I'm going to cut the bottom pipe
by<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.340> same<00:02:19.760> amount<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.360> cut<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.750> top

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
by the same amount that I cut the top

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.090 
by the same amount that I cut the top
pipe<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.830> I'll<00:02:21.950> mark<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.750> cut<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.860> join

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
pipe and I'll mark it and cut to join

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.890 
pipe and I'll mark it and cut to join
these<00:02:28.250> pieces<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.730> pipe<00:02:28.880> back<00:02:29.240> together<00:02:29.510> I'm

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
these pieces of pipe back together I'm

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.510 
these pieces of pipe back together I'm
going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> use<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> pair<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> couplings<00:02:31.250> these

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
going to use a pair of couplings these

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.060 
going to use a pair of couplings these
are<00:02:31.640> 3/4<00:02:32.270> copper<00:02:32.690> couplings<00:02:33.170> I'm<00:02:33.830> going<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
are 3/4 copper couplings I'm going to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.050 
are 3/4 copper couplings I'm going to
apply<00:02:34.340> some<00:02:34.370> flux<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.360> solder<00:02:35.720> them<00:02:35.960> together

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.430 

alright<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.210> at<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> end<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.840> run<00:02:42.200> there

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
alright so at the end of this run there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.900 
alright so at the end of this run there
is<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:42.680> plenty<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.340> room<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.670> actually

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
is now plenty of room I can actually

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.430 
is now plenty of room I can actually
stick<00:02:44.090> my<00:02:44.210> finger<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.290> can

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
stick my finger right in this and we can

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440 
stick my finger right in this and we can
expand<00:02:45.920> perfectly<00:02:46.520> but<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.150> have<00:02:47.270> more<00:02:47.390> work

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
expand perfectly but we have more work

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.900 
expand perfectly but we have more work
to<00:02:47.600> do<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.930> master<00:02:48.230> bedroom<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:49.730> right

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
to do in the master bedroom all right

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.820 
to do in the master bedroom all right
Roy<00:02:50.060> by<00:02:50.300> shortening<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.020> baseboard<00:02:51.590> over

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
Roy by shortening that baseboard over

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.140 
Roy by shortening that baseboard over
there<00:02:51.980> we're<00:02:52.160> taking<00:02:52.460> care<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.910> whole

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
there we're taking care of this whole

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.120 
there we're taking care of this whole
wall<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.560> wall<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.890> something

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
wall but on this wall it's something

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.570 
wall but on this wall it's something
different

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
different

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.520 
different
these<00:02:55.910> pipes<00:02:56.270> are<00:02:56.480> pinned<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.990> this<00:02:57.140> corner

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
these pipes are pinned in this corner

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.280 
these pipes are pinned in this corner
they<00:02:58.130> pinned<00:02:58.460> in<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.850> corner<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.900> really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
they pinned in that corner so I really

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.780 
they pinned in that corner so I really
can't<00:03:00.470> shorten<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.040> base<00:03:01.190> width<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.640> did

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
can't shorten the base width like I did

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.880 
can't shorten the base width like I did
in<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.030> room<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:02.900> we<00:03:03.020> this<00:03:03.350> one<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.710> got<00:03:03.830> to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
in that room so if we this one we got to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.100 
in that room so if we this one we got to
do<00:03:03.980> something<00:03:04.160> different<00:03:05.050> these<00:03:06.050> are

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
do something different these are

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.710 
do something different these are
actually<00:03:06.680> flexible<00:03:07.310> connectors<00:03:07.910> they<00:03:08.600> can

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
actually flexible connectors they can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.810 
actually flexible connectors they can
work<00:03:08.870> like<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.080> shock<00:03:09.380> absorber<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.310> as<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
work like a shock absorber so as the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.370 
work like a shock absorber so as the
pipe<00:03:11.000> wants<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.360> expand<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.840> contract<00:03:11.900> this

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
pipe wants to expand and contract this

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.900 
pipe wants to expand and contract this
can<00:03:12.560> absorb<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.340> make<00:03:13.550> sure<00:03:13.580> there's<00:03:13.850> no

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
can absorb it and make sure there's no

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.550 
can absorb it and make sure there's no
expansion<00:03:14.270> noise<00:03:14.600> for<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.380> we're<00:03:15.530> just

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
expansion noise for this we're just

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.870 
expansion noise for this we're just
going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.830> cut<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.130> pipe<00:03:16.310> we're<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:16.820> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
going to cut the pipe we're going to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.920 
going to cut the pipe we're going to
clean<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.240> we're<00:03:17.330> going<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> flex<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
clean it we're going to flex it and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.430 
clean it we're going to flex it and
solder<00:03:18.140> just<00:03:18.380> like<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.560> did<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.709> couplings<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
solder just like we did the couplings I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.690 
solder just like we did the couplings I
want<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.500> show<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.709> one<00:03:21.920> more<00:03:22.100> thing<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.430> can

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
want to show you one more thing that can

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.030 
want to show you one more thing that can
reduce<00:03:22.850> noise<00:03:23.270> now<00:03:24.260> these<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:24.890> called

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
reduce noise now these are called

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.490 
reduce noise now these are called
carriers<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.970> they're<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> plastic<00:03:27.260> piece

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
carriers and they're a plastic piece

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.590 
carriers and they're a plastic piece
that's<00:03:27.860> designed<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.459> sit<00:03:28.760> at<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.000> bottom<00:03:29.450> of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
that's designed to sit at the bottom of

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.500 
that's designed to sit at the bottom of
the<00:03:29.959> fin<00:03:30.440> right<00:03:30.740> there<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.760> what<00:03:31.910> happens<00:03:32.300> is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
the fin right there and what happens is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.930 
the fin right there and what happens is
it<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.260> allow<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.560> fin<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.280> expand<00:03:34.760> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it can allow that fin to expand and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.340 
it can allow that fin to expand and
contract<00:03:35.000> backwards<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.930> not<00:03:35.990> have<00:03:36.200> that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
contract backwards and not have that

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.650 
contract backwards and not have that
ticking<00:03:36.770> noise<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.190> heard<00:03:37.340> before

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
ticking noise that you heard before

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.730 
ticking noise that you heard before
alright<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:38.870> these<00:03:38.990> will<00:03:39.230> clip<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.680> here

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
alright so these will clip right here

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.550 
alright so these will clip right here
whether<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.940> hanger<00:03:41.270> bracket<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.780> now<00:03:42.500> we

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
whether the hanger bracket is now we

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.960 
whether the hanger bracket is now we
