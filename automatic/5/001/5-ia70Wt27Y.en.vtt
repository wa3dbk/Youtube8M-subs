00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
going to go soon not a fan of sharpening

going to go soon not a fan of sharpening
my<00:00:15.990> knife<00:00:16.199> every<00:00:16.830> day<00:00:17.010> every<00:00:17.340> other<00:00:17.369> day<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
my knife every day every other day so I

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.700 
my knife every day every other day so I
use<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.289> knives<00:00:19.529> often<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.170> pretty<00:00:22.170> harsh<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
use my knives often and pretty harsh I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.240 
use my knives often and pretty harsh I
cut<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.420> said<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.630> previous<00:00:25.320> videos<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.010> cut

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
cut I said in previous videos I cut

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
cut I said in previous videos I cut
copper<00:00:26.609> cables<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> stuff<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
copper cables and stuff like that

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
copper cables and stuff like that
computer<00:00:28.830> cables<00:00:29.250> sometimes<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.970> my<00:00:30.119> knife

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
computer cables sometimes with my knife

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
computer cables sometimes with my knife
when<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.380> too<00:00:31.769> lazy<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.149> know

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
when I'm too lazy to go get the you know

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.119 
when I'm too lazy to go get the you know
cutters<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:35.149> it's<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.809> laid<00:00:37.320> soft<00:00:37.710> still

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
cutters so it's it's laid soft still

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
cutters so it's it's laid soft still
it's<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.540> opinion<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.200> actually<00:00:40.649> much

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it's in my opinion it's actually much

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
it's in my opinion it's actually much
softer<00:00:41.340> even<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.790> I'd<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.210> Arterton<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
softer even then I'd see Arterton a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.740 
softer even then I'd see Arterton a
movie<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.340> I<00:00:44.340> definitely<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
movie and I definitely don't think the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.049 
movie and I definitely don't think the
knife<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.200> worth<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> selling<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> for

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
knife is worth what is selling it for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.020 
knife is worth what is selling it for
and<00:00:49.050> even<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> convex<00:00:50.340> edge<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.760> still

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and even with the convex edge is still

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.240 
and even with the convex edge is still
be<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.379> better<00:00:52.590> than<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
be it was a little better than with the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
be it was a little better than with the
VH<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> resistance<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.960> you're

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
VH because the resistance when you're

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
VH because the resistance when you're
cutting<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.469> something<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> less<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
cutting through something is less so the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.529 
cutting through something is less so the
forces<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> edge<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:58.410> smaller<00:00:59.399> but<00:01:00.210> still

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
forces on the edge are smaller but still

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.799 
forces on the edge are smaller but still
not<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.960> great<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.770> seen<00:01:02.640> yesterday<00:01:02.879> got

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
not that great you seen yesterday got

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.480 
not that great you seen yesterday got
these<00:01:03.989> two<00:01:04.729> mirrors<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:07.070> they<00:01:08.070> look<00:01:08.250> pretty

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
these two mirrors and they look pretty

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.260 
these two mirrors and they look pretty
good<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.760> far

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
good so far

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.350 
good so far
except<00:01:09.780> yet<00:01:10.080> again<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.560> eight<00:01:11.040> steel<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
except yet again or eight steel so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.260 
except yet again or eight steel so
they're<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> great<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.729> not

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
they're not going to be great but not

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
they're not going to be great but not
that<00:01:15.540> bad<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> knives<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.979> decent

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that bad the knives are actually decent

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.060 
that bad the knives are actually decent

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
with the CNC machining you see those

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
with the CNC machining you see those
grooves<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.600> looks<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:24.900> good<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
grooves there looks pretty good the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
grooves there looks pretty good the
handles<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.520> identical<00:01:27.409> blades

no blade play this one has tiny little
blade<00:02:17.840> play<00:02:18.170> because<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.849> lock<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.540> not

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
blade play because the the lock is not

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.199 
blade play because the the lock is not
like<00:02:21.470> bent<00:02:22.459> enough<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:23.659> actually<00:02:23.690> has<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:25.209> space

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
like bent enough it actually has a space

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.240 
like bent enough it actually has a space
to<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.599> even<00:02:26.900> further<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.829> because<00:02:28.129> it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
to go even further but because it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.289 
to go even further but because it
doesn't<00:02:28.549> spring<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.720> much<00:02:29.930> there<00:02:30.920> is

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
doesn't spring out so much there is

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:39.039 
doesn't spring out so much there is
little<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.680> hear<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.250> guess<00:02:37.599> but<00:02:38.599> it

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
little you can hear it I guess but it

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.569 
little you can hear it I guess but it
could<00:02:39.319> be<00:02:39.440> actually<00:02:39.560> fixable<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.280> take<00:02:40.459> it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
could be actually fixable you take it

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.280 
could be actually fixable you take it
apart<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.000> bend<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.629> more<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.140> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
apart and bend it a little more so the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.490 
apart and bend it a little more so the
lag<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.709> travel<00:02:43.459> further<00:02:43.849> down<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
lag will travel further down but I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.380 
lag will travel further down but I
should<00:02:46.099> like<00:02:46.129> this<00:02:46.400> one<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.700> play<00:02:46.849> chip<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.269> a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
and for the money I paid for it not that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.080 
and for the money I paid for it not that
but<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:55.819> one<00:02:56.000> has<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> very<00:02:56.299> very<00:02:56.870> rapid

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
this is that the construction I took it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.839 
this is that the construction I took it
apart<00:03:15.230> because<00:03:15.980> I've<00:03:16.250> seen<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.639> with<00:03:16.790> the
