00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.409 

all<00:00:01.530> right<00:00:01.680> today<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.040> will<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.639> replacing<00:00:03.090> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
all right today I will be replacing the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right today I will be replacing the
keyboard<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:04.049> 18-135<00:00:04.830> d<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:06.210> procedure<00:00:06.629> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
keyboard on 18-135 d this procedure is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.860 
keyboard on 18-135 d this procedure is
very<00:00:07.020> similar<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.680> many<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.940> satellite

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
very similar for many of the satellite

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.950 
very similar for many of the satellite
lineup<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.250> should<00:00:11.429> work<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.969> most<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
lineup so it should work for most of

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.150 
lineup so it should work for most of
them<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.559> first<00:00:13.740> thing<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.099> to

them the first thing you're going to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.039 
them the first thing you're going to
want<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.849> remove<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.360> battery<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.870> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
want to do is remove the battery as I
