00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
it sit for like make an hour before you

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.569 
it sit for like make an hour before you
use<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.590> gets<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.160> smooth

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.860 
I think for the most part I like it I
would<00:06:42.460> say<00:06:42.700> if<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:43.000> have<00:06:43.120> you<00:06:43.480> know<00:06:43.540> if<00:06:43.750> you

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
would say if you have you know if you

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.570 
would say if you have you know if you
want<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.110> try<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.380> maybe<00:06:44.800> dry<00:06:45.190> on<00:06:45.340> the<00:06:45.430> day<00:06:45.550> that

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
want to try it maybe dry on the day that

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.250 
want to try it maybe dry on the day that
you<00:06:45.760> weren't<00:06:46.090> gonna<00:06:46.270> go<00:06:46.480> do<00:06:46.660> some<00:06:46.870> things<00:06:47.110> to

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
you weren't gonna go do some things to

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.800 
you weren't gonna go do some things to
that<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:48.250> know<00:06:48.340> maybe<00:06:48.640> if<00:06:48.880> it<00:06:48.970> did<00:06:49.210> bad<00:06:49.450> it

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
that you know maybe if it did bad it

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.240 
that you know maybe if it did bad it
wouldn't<00:06:50.380> you<00:06:50.770> know<00:06:50.830> bother<00:06:51.430> you<00:06:51.730> um<00:06:52.030> I<00:06:53.250> think

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
wouldn't you know bother you um I think

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.920 
wouldn't you know bother you um I think
it's<00:06:54.430> probably<00:06:54.820> worth<00:06:55.060> trying<00:06:55.390> once<00:06:55.690> or<00:06:55.810> twice

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
it's probably worth trying once or twice

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.480 
it's probably worth trying once or twice
i'm<00:06:56.230> probably<00:06:56.440> gonna<00:06:56.590> do<00:06:56.830> it<00:06:56.920> again<00:06:57.010> and<00:06:57.280> see

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
i'm probably gonna do it again and see

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.330 
i'm probably gonna do it again and see
