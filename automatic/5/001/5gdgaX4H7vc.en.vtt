00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
definitely worth it all it does is turn

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.340 
definitely worth it all it does is turn
the<00:00:17.400> gun<00:00:17.520> upside<00:00:17.850> down<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.170> buy

the upgraded ammo for the same price as

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
the upgraded ammo for the same price as
the<00:00:22.410> regular<00:00:22.769> ammo<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.580> upgraded<00:00:23.970> ammo

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the regular ammo so the upgraded ammo

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.529 
the regular ammo so the upgraded ammo
for<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> mp5k<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.650> only<00:00:25.830> 500<00:00:26.279> points<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
for the mp5k now is only 500 points so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.359 
for the mp5k now is only 500 points so
it's<00:00:27.720> good<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.050> you're<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.740> guns<00:00:29.130> off<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it's good if you're using guns off the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.569 
it's good if you're using guns off the
wall<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.630> we've<00:00:31.170> got<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> doors<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> they

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
wall here we've got the doors and they

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.470 
wall here we've got the doors and they
take<00:00:32.820> absolutely<00:00:33.420> ages<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.739> hack<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.480> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
take absolutely ages to hack and it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
take absolutely ages to hack and it
costs<00:00:36.780> 200<00:00:37.110> points<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> hack<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
costs 200 points to hack it and so

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.790 
costs 200 points to hack it and so
you're<00:00:38.910> saving<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.420> 800<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> thousand

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you're saving about 800 to a thousand

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
you're saving about 800 to a thousand
points<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.480> always<00:00:42.690> good<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.140> want

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
points so it's always good if you want

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
points so it's always good if you want
to<00:00:43.440> save<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.219> points<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> box<00:00:45.270> or

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to save up some points for the box or

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
to save up some points for the box or
whatever<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:46.860> sure<00:00:46.890> someone's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
whatever and but make sure someone's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
whatever and but make sure someone's
watching<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> crawler<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
watching the crawler or if you're in

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
watching the crawler or if you're in
solo<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.770> far<00:00:50.070> enough<00:00:50.280> away<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> had<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
solo get far enough away see I had to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
solo get far enough away see I had to
stop<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.890> crawler<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.340> too

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
stop here because the crawler was too

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
stop here because the crawler was too
close<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.829> that's<00:00:55.829> pretty<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.469> yeah

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
close but that's pretty much it and yeah

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.959 
close but that's pretty much it and yeah
we've<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> windows<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.399> well<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> didn't

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
we've got the windows as well I didn't

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
we've got the windows as well I didn't
actually<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.780> hack<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:01.289> till

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
actually know you could hack these till

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually know you could hack these till
I<00:01:01.760> walked<00:01:02.760> past<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> hacking

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
I walked past one with the hacking

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
I walked past one with the hacking
device<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.489> whoa<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:06.060> hack<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
device out and was like whoa can hack it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.160 
device out and was like whoa can hack it
that's<00:01:07.200> pretty<00:01:07.530> cool<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:09.630> yeah<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that's pretty cool and but yeah all it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.649 
that's pretty cool and but yeah all it
does<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> basically<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.280> like

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
does is basically it's just like

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.880 
does is basically it's just like
rebuilds<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> window<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.350> quickly<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
rebuilds the window pretty quickly and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670 
rebuilds the window pretty quickly and
you<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.400> 100<00:01:14.970> points<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.259> much

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you get 100 points for it so it's much

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800 
you get 100 points for it so it's much
better<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> 60<00:01:17.759> points<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
better than the 60 points you get and it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.070 
better than the 60 points you get and it
does<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> quicker<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.210> yes<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> next<00:01:21.960> we've

that's<00:01:42.570> useful<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.070> actual<00:01:44.610> gameplay<00:01:45.000> if

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's useful in the actual gameplay if

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
that's useful in the actual gameplay if
you're<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> wanting<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.759> know

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you're like wanting to get I don't know

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
you're like wanting to get I don't know
but<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.600> we've<00:01:48.720> got<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> box<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.759> hack

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
but here we've got the box and you hack

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.719 
but here we've got the box and you hack
it<00:01:51.119> once<00:01:51.680> back<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> rigging<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.460> really

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it once back to the rigging so really

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
it once back to the rigging so really
didn't<00:01:53.939> want<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> regen

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
didn't want it I don't like the regen

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
didn't want it I don't like the regen
and<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.579> cost<00:01:56.909> six<00:01:57.119> hundred<00:01:57.149> points<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and and it cost six hundred points to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
and and it cost six hundred points to
hack<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> getting<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.560> spin<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.040> 600

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
hack it so you getting over spin for 600

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.109 
hack it so you getting over spin for 600
but<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> hack<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> again<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:01.530> happens

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but if you hack it again what happens

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.010 
but if you hack it again what happens
it<00:02:03.630> glares<00:02:04.460> one<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.790> teammates<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.780> take

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it glares one of your teammates can take

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.620 
it glares one of your teammates can take
it<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.829> see<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.340> teammate<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.759> got<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> HK

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
it so see my teammate there got the HK

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.770 
it so see my teammate there got the HK
21<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.970> here<00:02:11.970> we're<00:02:12.150> hacking<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.569> Packer

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
21 and here we're hacking the Packer

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.460 
21 and here we're hacking the Packer
punch<00:02:14.180> which<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:15.840> good<00:02:15.989> idea<00:02:16.260> if

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
punch which is a really good idea if

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.650 
punch which is a really good idea if
like<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:16.980> than<00:02:17.099> one<00:02:17.250> person<00:02:17.580> wants<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> use

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
like more than one person wants to use

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.240 
like more than one person wants to use
the<00:02:18.870> Packer<00:02:19.050> punch<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.560> cage<00:02:19.920> comes

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the Packer punch because a cage comes

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.800 
the Packer punch because a cage comes
around<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.580> Packer<00:02:20.760> bunch<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.540> zombies

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
around the Packer bunch so the zombies

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.770 
around the Packer bunch so the zombies
can't<00:02:22.050> gain<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:24.239> quite<00:02:24.480> hectic

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
can't gain but it's it's quite hectic

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.370 
can't gain but it's it's quite hectic
getting<00:02:25.260> out<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.920> watch<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
getting out of there so watch out on the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
getting out of there so watch out on the
best<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.190> best<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.910> hack<00:02:30.120> is

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
best bit the best thing you can hack is

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.390 
best bit the best thing you can hack is
the<00:02:30.390> drops<00:02:30.840> get<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.560> close<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.890> him<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.220> cost

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the drops get right close to him it cost

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.610 
the drops get right close to him it cost
5,000<00:02:33.150> points<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:33.959> definitely<00:02:34.230> worth

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
5,000 points but it's definitely worth

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.289 
5,000 points but it's definitely worth
it<00:02:34.769> because<00:02:34.860> every<00:02:35.130> time<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.370> do<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.489> BAM<00:02:35.940> you

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
it because every time you do it BAM you

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.410 
it because every time you do it BAM you
get<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> max<00:02:36.720> demo<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:39.150> really

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
get a max demo and that is really really

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.860 
get a max demo and that is really really
really<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.700> relevant<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.330> at<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
really really relevant to do that at the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.830 
really really relevant to do that at the
end<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.180> you're<00:02:45.299> on<00:02:45.360> really<00:02:45.690> high

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
end of the like if you're on really high

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.839 
end of the like if you're on really high
rounds<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.860> run<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> ammo<00:02:47.459> so

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
rounds because you run out of ammo so

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.420 
rounds because you run out of ammo so
easy<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.319> every<00:02:49.680> time<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.950> see<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.130> drop

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
easy and so every time you see a drop

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.259 
easy and so every time you see a drop
get<00:02:50.970> someone<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> throw<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.510> gush<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.200> then

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
get someone to throw a gush and then

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.479 
get someone to throw a gush and then
hack<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.599> drop<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.220> max

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
hack the drop and you will get in max

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.759 
hack the drop and you will get in max
ammo<00:02:56.730> every<00:02:56.940> time<00:02:57.150> 5000<00:02:57.780> points<00:02:57.930> points

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
ammo every time 5000 points points

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.839 
ammo every time 5000 points points
shouldn't<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> problem<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.670> later

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
shouldn't be a problem on the later

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.670 
shouldn't be a problem on the later
rounds<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.780> yeah<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.080> pretty<00:03:01.290> much<00:03:01.410> all

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
rounds but yeah that's pretty much all

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.289 
rounds but yeah that's pretty much all
you<00:03:01.799> can<00:03:01.860> hack<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.760> hacking<00:03:03.060> device

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
you can hack with the hacking device

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.509 
you can hack with the hacking device
apart<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.620> hack<00:03:04.769> each<00:03:04.950> other<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
apart from you can hack each other and

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.979 
apart from you can hack each other and
you<00:03:05.610> give<00:03:05.760> each<00:03:05.880> other<00:03:06.000> 500<00:03:06.330> points<00:03:06.810> but

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
you give each other 500 points but

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.370 
you give each other 500 points but
that's<00:03:07.739> not<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.280> great<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.380> anyway

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that's not really that great but anyway

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.080 
that's not really that great but anyway
