think they look pretty good there was a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.150 
think they look pretty good there was a
little<00:03:34.780> bit<00:03:34.990> of<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.140> trick<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.680> getting<00:03:35.920> them<00:03:36.010> on

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160

there

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.309 

I<00:03:43.879> may<00:03:45.249> modify<00:03:46.249> them<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.519> little<00:03:46.879> bit<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.510> fit<00:03:48.109> a

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
I may modify them a little bit to fit a

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.149 
I may modify them a little bit to fit a
little<00:03:48.590> bit<00:03:48.829> better<00:03:49.040> with<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.549> straps

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
little bit better with the straps

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.979

because where the straps ride right here

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.080 
because where the straps ride right here
you<00:03:56.989> have<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.379> cross<00:03:57.680> them<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.280> way<00:03:58.609> under

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
you have to cross them this way under

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:08.499 
I think it adds quite a bit to the look
