00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
this world they're not the only people
going<00:01:34.979> through<00:01:35.009> obstacles<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
going through obstacles and that we can

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
going through obstacles and that we can
overcome<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.200> together<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.159> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
overcome this together I think it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.649 
overcome this together I think it's
amazing<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> talk<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.540> know

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
amazing that you talk about you know

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
amazing that you talk about you know
obstacles<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> say<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
not you know that everybody runs into

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
not you know that everybody runs into
obstacles<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.720> deal

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
obstacles it's really about how we deal

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.719

with<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.590> obstacles<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> how<00:01:47.670> we

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
with those obstacles right and how we

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
with those obstacles right and how we
