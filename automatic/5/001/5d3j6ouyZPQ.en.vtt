00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
how do you really kind of screw

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.319 
how do you really kind of screw
themselves<00:03:10.400> over<00:03:10.670> would<00:03:10.849> get<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.090> rid<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
themselves over would get it rid of the

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.059 
themselves over would get it rid of the
other<00:03:11.510> Allroad<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:13.220> stop<00:03:13.489> 205<00:03:14.409> so<00:03:15.409> they<00:03:15.859> could

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
other Allroad in stop 205 so they could

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.830 
other Allroad in stop 205 so they could
have<00:03:16.159> continued<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:16.730> but<00:03:17.060> they<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.419> didn't

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
have continued on but they just didn't

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.649 
have continued on but they just didn't
with<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.200> new<00:03:18.349> shape<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.799> o6<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.389> that

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
with the new shape in o6 so that that

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.599 
with the new shape in o6 so that that
was<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> big<00:03:21.169> mistake<00:03:21.379> for<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.889> a6<00:03:22.310> they<00:03:22.430> got

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
was a big mistake for the a6 they got

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.009 
was a big mistake for the a6 they got
rid<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.269> reason<00:03:23.419> being<00:03:23.840> is

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
rid of it and the reason being is

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.770 
rid of it and the reason being is
because<00:03:24.079> they<00:03:24.530> wanted<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:24.950> q7<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.790> shine<00:03:26.090> it

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
because they wanted the q7 to shine it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.420 
because they wanted the q7 to shine it
shows<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.260> people<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.859> want<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.189> drive

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
shows that people do want to drive

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.240 
shows that people do want to drive

like<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.130> said<00:03:47.190> stereos<00:03:47.790> great

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.080 

you<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.879> telephone

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090

capability<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.200> part<00:03:53.439> topped<00:03:53.709> out<00:03:53.950> around

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
capability this part topped out around

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.509 
capability this part topped out around
48,000<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.379> actually<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.920> add<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.280> extra

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
48,000 so you actually you add the extra

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.030 
48,000 so you actually you add the extra
two<00:03:57.790> grand<00:03:57.819> or<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.659> for<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.290> NAD<00:03:59.500> it's<00:03:59.890> just

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
but I'm sorry I still think that it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.520 
but I'm sorry I still think that it
should<00:04:20.620> be<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> lot<00:04:20.919> cheaper<00:04:20.979> in<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.090> 30s<00:04:22.600> this

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
should be a lot cheaper in the 30s this

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.379 
should be a lot cheaper in the 30s this
is<00:04:23.710> actually<00:04:24.220> more<00:04:24.400> money<00:04:24.460> than<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.940> original

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
is actually more money than the original

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.900 
is actually more money than the original
