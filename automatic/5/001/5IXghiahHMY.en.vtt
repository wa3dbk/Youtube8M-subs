the whole night actually you know is a
pretty<00:02:13.270> good<00:02:13.630> scrap<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.500> most<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.980> rounds<00:02:15.460> in

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
pretty good scrap for most the rounds in

pretty good scrap for most the rounds in
the<00:02:16.570> third<00:02:16.810> round<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.260> looked<00:02:17.440> like<00:02:17.590> let<00:02:17.740> me

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
the third round it looked like let me

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.770 
the third round it looked like let me
double-check<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> third<00:02:19.300> round<00:02:19.510> look

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
double-check in the third round look

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.450 
double-check in the third round look
like<00:02:19.930> Vargas<00:02:20.380> had<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.800> round<00:02:21.130> actually

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
like Vargas had that round actually

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.820 
like Vargas had that round actually
Teddy<00:02:21.850> Atlas<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.480> made<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:22.990> comment<00:02:23.470> saying<00:02:23.650> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
Teddy Atlas it made a comment saying I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.700 
Teddy Atlas it made a comment saying I
think<00:02:24.010> he's<00:02:24.100> got<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> round<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.300> then

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
think he's got that round but then

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.260 
think he's got that round but then
Johnson<00:02:26.710> came<00:02:27.040> back<00:02:27.220> stole<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.120> some

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
Johnson came back stole it with some

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.800 
Johnson came back stole it with some
huge<00:02:28.600> left<00:02:28.870> hands<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.890> great<00:02:30.220> right<00:02:30.459> hand

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
huge left hands in a great right hand

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.480 
huge left hands in a great right hand
that<00:02:31.810> actually<00:02:32.200> made<00:02:32.500> Vargas<00:02:32.980> take<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> knee

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
that actually made Vargas take a knee

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.490 
that actually made Vargas take a knee
and<00:02:33.760> he<00:02:34.060> took<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.270> me<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> couple<00:02:34.720> times<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.230> guess

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and he took it me a couple times I guess

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.770 
and he took it me a couple times I guess
they<00:02:35.680> were<00:02:35.740> saying<00:02:36.070> these<00:02:36.400> wide<00:02:36.760> hooks<00:02:37.120> that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
they were saying these wide hooks that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.340 
they were saying these wide hooks that
left<00:02:38.200> hooks<00:02:38.440> especially<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.250> Johnson<00:02:39.760> was

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
left hooks especially that Johnson was

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.020 
left hooks especially that Johnson was
throwing<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.560> guess<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.040> hitting<00:02:42.280> Vargas

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
throwing I guess it was hitting Vargas

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.880 
throwing I guess it was hitting Vargas
here<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.480> could<00:02:43.660> see<00:02:43.810> some<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:44.110> them<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.800> he

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
was a very exciting heavyweight fight

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.300 
was a very exciting heavyweight fight
for<00:03:10.570> only<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.020> only<00:03:11.080> lasted<00:03:11.650> not<00:03:11.770> even<00:03:12.040> six

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
for only it only lasted not even six

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.270 
for only it only lasted not even six
rounds<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.110> sixth<00:03:14.410> round<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
rounds just in the sixth round so I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.310 
rounds just in the sixth round so I
thought<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.880> good<00:03:16.060> fight<00:03:16.299> Johnson<00:03:17.140> for

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
thought it was a good fight Johnson for

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.600 
thought it was a good fight Johnson for
the<00:03:17.350> future<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> think<00:03:18.100> he<00:03:18.160> needs<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.400> keep

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
the future I think he needs to keep

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.840 
the future I think he needs to keep
fighting<00:03:19.739> keep<00:03:20.739> getting<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.160> experienced

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.860 
at the time plus he's got a grand chin
one<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.739> best<00:03:38.980> chins<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.730> all<00:03:40.269> time<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.720> my

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
one of the best chins of all time in my

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.410 
one of the best chins of all time in my
opinion<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:42.310> he<00:03:42.459> could<00:03:42.610> take<00:03:42.820> those<00:03:43.090> hits

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
opinion so he could take those hits

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.690 
opinion so he could take those hits
whereas<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.380> see<00:03:44.590> Floyd<00:03:44.950> now<00:03:45.310> he<00:03:45.519> doesn't

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
whereas you see Floyd now he doesn't

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.890 
whereas you see Floyd now he doesn't
take<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.329> big<00:03:46.540> hits

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
take the big hits

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.229 
take the big hits
he<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:47.650> does<00:03:47.890> protect<00:03:48.400> himself<00:03:48.579> well<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
he really does protect himself well and

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.789 
he really does protect himself well and
actually<00:03:49.360> counters<00:03:49.989> off<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.380> rope<00:03:50.560> and

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
actually counters off the rope and

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.949 
actually counters off the rope and
actually<00:03:51.400> uses<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.360> like<00:03:52.510> Muhammad<00:03:52.870> Ali

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
actually uses it just like Muhammad Ali

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.460 
actually uses it just like Muhammad Ali
as<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.440> strategy<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.120> see<00:03:55.470> Johnson

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
as a strategy and you can see Johnson

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.550 
as a strategy and you can see Johnson
fights<00:03:57.190> an<00:03:57.459> atlas<00:03:57.850> said<00:03:58.060> this<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.450> me<00:03:59.230> fights

in<00:03:59.799> spots<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.579> know<00:04:01.049> he<00:04:02.049> was<00:04:02.200> purposely<00:04:02.860> I

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
in spots you know he was purposely I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.410

think<00:04:03.280> he<00:04:03.370> lost<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.760> first<00:04:04.000> round<00:04:04.180> just

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
think he lost that first round just

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.120 
think he lost that first round just
purposely<00:04:04.840> trying<00:04:05.049> to<00:04:05.110> get<00:04:05.350> inside<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
purposely trying to get inside the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.640 
purposely trying to get inside the
pocket<00:04:06.549> he<00:04:07.269> puts<00:04:07.720> his<00:04:07.840> hands<00:04:08.049> up<00:04:08.230> real<00:04:08.470> nice

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
pocket he puts his hands up real nice

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.110 
pocket he puts his hands up real nice
and<00:04:08.680> tight<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.280> he's<00:04:09.610> got<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.790> really<00:04:10.030> good

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
and tight so he's got a really good

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.569 
and tight so he's got a really good
defense<00:04:11.019> he<00:04:11.170> as<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> shoulder<00:04:11.829> roll<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.549> I

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
defensive guy that doesn't have a lot of

like Johnson I think he needs to keep
fighting<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.569> don't<00:04:35.599> think<00:04:35.780> he's<00:04:36.110> ready<00:04:36.289> for<00:04:36.530> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590
