00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 yes 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.549
 hi my name is sofÃ­a degree i am the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.260
 beautician worker and flame the day of 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.779
 today we are going to do some 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.230
 recommendations on how to put on makeup 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.540
 in the summer how to protect your skin 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.359
 against the sun's rays is super 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.260
 important that a person before 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.420
 Make up protect your skin 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.129
 especially with what is a good 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.280
 hydration cleaning the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.290
 toning the hydration of the skin and 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.450
 additional to this you can start 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.940
 protect it now that we are in summer 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.170
 The first step is for our skin to be 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.710
 first clean toned and hydrated 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.309
 we have in the market many 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.469
 creams that help us 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.120
 apart from hydrating it also has the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.929
 sunscreen moisturizer 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.630
 then it is super important we have to 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:08.450
 creams we are going to use the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.899
 cream see that according to the type of 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.630
 skin and the age of each person is 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.880
 important 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.100
 about hydration then we're going to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.039
 place a sunscreen on this 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 I am placing a protection 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.789
 solar factor 20 that approximately me 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.840
 will help protect the skin from the sun 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.840
 between 3 to 4 hours 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.070
 we place the base of the machine this 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 It must be the same according to the tone 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 of each person's skin 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.320
 this one does not have much to correct but 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 if we can correct what it is to catch and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530
 these 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:04.130
 and the pending and coming yes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:08.580
 little spots is that we have then 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.070
 this if we use our finger 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 and cancel that is the least force 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.740
 have to cover imperfections 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.740
 in the base of makeup 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 more natural 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.440
 we place the blues always measuring 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.750
 our half of the iris of the eye 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.870
 we point to the final tri- cheekbone and that's 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.599
 the beginning where I put the blues of 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.360
 this point towards the temples we make 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:49.340
 first one brand one line 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.270
 in relationships and then 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.450
 blurred 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.450
 we started to tell what is the shadows 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.360
 as it is a summer makeup because it 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.090
 recommends the shadows that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.510
 we use base throughout the eyelid 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.680
 movable and the one that does not move that is a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.950
 shadow not very pearly 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.829
 because with the challenges of reflection from 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.650
 the light may shine too bright and 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:26.530
 will see in a very exaggerated makeup 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.530
 I'm going to use a brown tone 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.540
 very soft 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.200
 and we are going to place it 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.200
 in the crease of his eye 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.220
 doing an ace level 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.020
 of those that are 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.660
 it's much more casual than you can 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.170
 use during the day the two are from 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.170
 summer 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.709
 and at the same time more natural
