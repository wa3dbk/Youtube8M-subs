00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.470 
choice the most obvious move they're
taking<00:06:57.230> is<00:06:57.800> losing<00:06:58.340> immediately<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.300> that

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
taking is losing immediately and that

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.920 
taking is losing immediately and that
that's<00:06:59.870> simply<00:07:00.440> impossible<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:02.240> while<00:07:02.780> i'm

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
that's simply impossible and while i'm
