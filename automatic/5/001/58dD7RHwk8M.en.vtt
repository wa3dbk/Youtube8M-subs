today<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> talk<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.139> which

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
today I'm going to talk about which

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.129 
today I'm going to talk about which
portion<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.240> weight<00:00:15.450> training<00:00:15.600> movement

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
portion of a weight training movement

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.840 
portion of a weight training movement
actually<00:00:16.470> brings<00:00:16.770> about<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.189> growth<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
actually brings about the growth and the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.420 
actually brings about the growth and the
visual<00:00:18.300> results<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:18.990> want<00:00:19.260> there's<00:00:20.220> two

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
visual results we all want there's two

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.800 
visual results we all want there's two
different<00:00:20.610> phases<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> every<00:00:21.630> weight

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
different phases to every weight

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
different phases to every weight
training<00:00:22.140> movement<00:00:22.500> whether<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> be

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
training movement whether it be

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.390 
training movement whether it be
benchpress<00:00:23.720> bicep<00:00:24.720> curls<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.380> squats<00:00:25.770> two

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
benchpress bicep curls or squats two

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
benchpress bicep curls or squats two
different<00:00:26.699> phases<00:00:27.350> concentric<00:00:28.350> and<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
different phases concentric and the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.330 
different phases concentric and the
eccentric<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:30.150> concentric<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.980> example

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
eccentric the concentric is for example

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
eccentric the concentric is for example
on<00:00:32.460> bench<00:00:32.669> press<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.720> push<00:00:34.040> back<00:00:35.040> up

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
on bench press that's the push back up

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
on bench press that's the push back up
to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.400> top<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.900> where<00:00:37.110> your

to the top and that's not where your

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.770 
to the top and that's not where your
gains<00:00:37.470> come<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.640> gains<00:00:39.000> come<00:00:39.390> from<00:00:39.630> the

the<00:00:44.070> e<00:00:44.100> centric<00:00:44.760> fits<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.750> biggest<00:00:46.140> mistake<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the e centric fits the biggest mistake I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
the e centric fits the biggest mistake I
see<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:47.010> beginners<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
see in beginners is when they get in the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
see in beginners is when they get in the
gym<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.739> happen<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.340> on

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
gym and you just happen to see it on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.620 
gym and you just happen to see it on
bench<00:00:50.640> press<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.390> there's<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
bench press right because there's the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.080 
bench press right because there's the
beach<00:00:51.780> muscles<00:00:52.489> everybody<00:00:53.489> asks<00:00:53.640> come<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
beach muscles everybody asks come as you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
beach muscles everybody asks come as you
can<00:00:54.210> bench<00:00:54.620> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.710> goofy<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.670> see

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
can bench kind of goofy but you see

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
can bench kind of goofy but you see
these<00:00:57.000> guys<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.660> ask<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.020> question<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
these guys that ask that question and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
these guys that ask that question and
what<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.610> they<00:00:59.789> struggle<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
what do they do they struggle to get it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.330 
what do they do they struggle to get it
up<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.840> they're<00:01:01.140> squirming<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.680> button

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
up and they're squirming around button

the air lock in the elbows at the top

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
the air lock in the elbows at the top
and<00:01:05.190> then<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:05.910> do<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.630> go

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and then what do they do and just go

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.320 
and then what do they do and just go
boom<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.530> lower<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> hard<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> fast<00:01:08.759> no

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
boom and then lower it hard and fast no

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.320 
boom and then lower it hard and fast no
eccentric<00:01:09.869> phase<00:01:10.020> no<00:01:10.320> resistance<00:01:10.800> at<00:01:10.950> all

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
eccentric phase no resistance at all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.790 
eccentric phase no resistance at all
crush<00:01:12.330> their<00:01:12.569> sternum<00:01:12.959> in<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.110> process<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
crush their sternum in the process and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.680 
crush their sternum in the process and
then<00:01:14.580> wonder<00:01:14.819> why<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.119> making<00:01:15.479> any

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
then wonder why they're not making any

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.630 
then wonder why they're not making any
gains<00:01:15.990> getting<00:01:16.380> stronger<00:01:16.679> looking<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.429> better

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
gains getting stronger looking me better

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.639 
gains getting stronger looking me better
in<00:01:17.789> the<00:01:17.850> chest<00:01:18.090> area<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:19.050> because

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
in the chest area that's why because

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.169 
in the chest area that's why because
they're<00:01:19.800> totally<00:01:20.160> neglecting<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.789> e<00:01:20.819> center

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
they're totally neglecting the e center

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.480 
they're totally neglecting the e center
portion<00:01:21.569> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> movement<00:01:22.280> eccentric<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
portion of the movement eccentric and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.059 
portion of the movement eccentric and
concentric<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.569> bicep<00:01:24.780> curl<00:01:26.479> concentrate

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
concentric on the bicep curl concentrate

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.350 
concentric on the bicep curl concentrate
eccentric<00:01:29.069> so<00:01:29.610> another<00:01:29.819> way<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
eccentric so another way to look at the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
eccentric so another way to look at the
e<00:01:30.390> center<00:01:30.630> portion<00:01:30.959> of<00:01:31.200> movement<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.979> it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
e center portion of movement is it's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
e center portion of movement is it's
actually<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.640> lengthening<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> muscle

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
actually the lengthening of the muscle

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
actually the lengthening of the muscle
in<00:01:34.259> question<00:01:34.679> so<00:01:36.410> think<00:01:37.410> about<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:38.130> next

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
in question so think about that the next

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.040 
in question so think about that the next
time<00:01:38.399> you're<00:01:38.759> torturing<00:01:39.450> yourself<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.959> the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
time you're torturing yourself in the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.160 
time you're torturing yourself in the
gym<00:01:40.319> okay<00:01:41.039> make<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.700> form<00:01:42.030> nice<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.959> tight

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
gym okay make your form nice and tight

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.650 
gym okay make your form nice and tight
really<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.160> about<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.520> eccentric<00:01:45.179> or<00:01:45.539> the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
really think about that eccentric or the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.480 
really think about that eccentric or the
resistance<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.590> lengthening<00:01:47.039> phase<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
resistance or the lengthening phase of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
resistance or the lengthening phase of
any<00:01:47.670> movement<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.149> squat<00:01:48.660> it's<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.410> lower

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
any movement or squat it's the lower

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.949 
any movement or squat it's the lower
ring<00:01:49.890> alright<00:01:50.849> bench<00:01:51.090> press<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> lowering

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
ring alright bench press the lowering

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.010

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.160 
for lat pull-downs for example the
eccentric<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.739> actually<00:01:56.239> the<00:01:57.239> going<00:01:57.810> back<00:01:57.840> up

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
eccentric is actually the going back up

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.839 
eccentric is actually the going back up
to<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.319> top<00:01:58.410> where<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.099> lengthening<00:01:59.280> lap

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
to the top where you're lengthening lap

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.930 
to the top where you're lengthening lap
or<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> concentric<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.890> back<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.580> think

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
or a concentric is back down I think

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.300 
or a concentric is back down I think
about<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.239> for<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> second<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:04.920> anyway

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
about that one for a second but anyway

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
about that one for a second but anyway
it's<00:02:05.970> always<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.450> lengthening<00:02:06.929> of<00:02:06.959> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it's always the lengthening of the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.760 
it's always the lengthening of the
muscle

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
muscle

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.969 
muscle
looking<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.599> screw<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
looking for so if you screw that up the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650 
looking for so if you screw that up the
really<00:02:11.220> bad<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> worst<00:02:12.030> case<00:02:12.120> scenario

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
really bad thing is worst case scenario

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.080 
really bad thing is worst case scenario
you<00:02:12.930> could<00:02:13.410> tear<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> muscle<00:02:13.849> screw<00:02:14.849> up<00:02:14.940> your

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you could tear a muscle screw up your

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.670 
you could tear a muscle screw up your
joints<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> don't<00:02:16.170> want<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.410> bounce

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
joints you know you don't want to bounce

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.800 
joints you know you don't want to bounce
on<00:02:17.010> any<00:02:17.430> portion<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.000> eccentric<00:02:18.420> movement<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
on any portion of eccentric movement you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
on any portion of eccentric movement you
want<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.989> control<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.560> more<00:02:20.069> than<00:02:20.099> anything

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
want to control that more than anything

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.589 
want to control that more than anything
in<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.640> world<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> most<00:02:21.180> important
