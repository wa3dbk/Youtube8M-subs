so<00:00:05.319> there<00:00:05.470> are<00:00:05.589> some<00:00:05.770> new<00:00:05.950> possibilities<00:00:06.670> for

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
so there are some new possibilities for

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.869 
so there are some new possibilities for
even<00:00:07.210> deeper<00:00:07.720> space<00:00:08.100> exploration<00:00:09.100> NASA<00:00:09.639> is

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879 
even deeper space exploration NASA is

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.019 
even deeper space exploration NASA is
now<00:00:10.059> working<00:00:10.240> on<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.510> new<00:00:10.809> space<00:00:11.350> outpost<00:00:12.029> which

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.029 
now working on a new space outpost which

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.000 
now working on a new space outpost which
would<00:00:13.209> be<00:00:13.240> near<00:00:13.539> the<00:00:13.660> far<00:00:14.020> side<00:00:14.440> of<00:00:14.469> the<00:00:14.680> moon

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
would be near the far side of the moon

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.189 
would be near the far side of the moon
this<00:00:15.760> is<00:00:15.940> what<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.209> proposed<00:00:16.480> capsule<00:00:16.990> would

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
this is what that proposed capsule would

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.590 
this is what that proposed capsule would
look<00:00:17.440> like<00:00:17.710> if<00:00:18.039> prisons<00:00:18.699> proven<00:00:19.180> successful

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
look like if prisons proven successful

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.820 
look like if prisons proven successful
it<00:00:19.840> would<00:00:19.960> allow<00:00:20.170> for<00:00:20.199> humans<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.740> travel

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
it would allow for humans to travel

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.610 
it would allow for humans to travel
farther<00:00:21.430> into<00:00:21.700> space<00:00:21.820> than<00:00:22.090> ever<00:00:22.300> before<00:00:22.930> Tom

a little post on the far side of the

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.590 
a little post on the far side of the
moon<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.499> it<00:00:39.190> feasible<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.940> we<00:00:40.269> could<00:00:40.420> build

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
moon is it feasible that we could build

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.660 
moon is it feasible that we could build
this<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.199> why<00:00:41.679> would<00:00:41.920> we<00:00:42.039> want<00:00:42.249> to<00:00:42.399> what<00:00:42.579> would

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
this and why would we want to what would

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.299 
this and why would we want to what would
it<00:00:42.789> give<00:00:42.940> us<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:44.350> l2<00:00:44.829> is<00:00:44.859> a<00:00:45.100> nice

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
it give us well l2 is a nice

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.579 
it give us well l2 is a nice

point in space happens to have a lot of
qualities<00:00:53.679> where<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.370> could<00:00:54.519> do<00:00:54.609> good<00:00:54.819> science

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
qualities where we could do good science

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.270 
qualities where we could do good science
we<00:00:55.510> could<00:00:55.659> assemble<00:00:56.229> spacecraft<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.039> go<00:00:57.129> down

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
we could assemble spacecraft to go down

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.500 
we could assemble spacecraft to go down
to<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.489> moon<00:00:57.699> or<00:00:57.819> out<00:00:57.940> farther<00:00:58.239> into<00:00:58.449> the

to the moon or out farther into the
solar<00:00:58.780> system<00:00:59.139> so<00:00:59.710> astronauts<00:01:00.190> might<00:01:00.429> be<00:01:00.549> able

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
solar system so astronauts might be able

to<00:01:00.760> visit<00:01:00.909> this<00:01:01.149> point<00:01:01.479> get<00:01:01.839> farther<00:01:02.139> than<00:01:02.350> the

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
to visit this point get farther than the

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.259 
to visit this point get farther than the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
moon farther beyond the moon and we did

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.360 
moon farther beyond the moon and we did
during<00:01:04.420> Apollo<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.170> maybe<00:01:05.830> Trump<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
during Apollo and maybe Trump the

Chinese plans to land astronauts on the
moon<00:01:08.200> by<00:01:08.409> 2020<00:01:08.920> so<00:01:09.039> it<00:01:09.100> has<00:01:09.219> a<00:01:09.250> lot<00:01:09.430> of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
moon by 2020 so it has a lot of

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.490 
moon by 2020 so it has a lot of
attractions<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.090> NASA<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.960> we<00:01:11.229> know<00:01:11.350> there's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
attractions for NASA so we know there's

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.859 
attractions for NASA so we know there's
been<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.649> lot<00:01:11.799> of<00:01:11.829> cuts<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.399> course<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.509> NASA

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
been a lot of cuts of course in the NASA

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.230 
been a lot of cuts of course in the NASA
budget<00:01:14.229> how<00:01:14.649> would<00:01:14.829> this<00:01:14.950> be<00:01:15.100> paid<00:01:15.310> for<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:15.969> do

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
budget how would this be paid for and do

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.569 
budget how would this be paid for and do
you<00:01:16.299> think<00:01:16.450> it's<00:01:16.539> actually<00:01:16.750> going<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.899> happen

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
you think it's actually going to happen

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.520 
you think it's actually going to happen
now<00:01:18.579> that's<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> rub<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.719> nASA<00:01:20.020> has<00:01:20.200> set

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
now that's the rub that nASA has set

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.349 
now that's the rub that nASA has set
itself<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.950> goal<00:01:21.159> of<00:01:21.369> visiting<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.789> asteroids

with<00:01:37.509> humans<00:01:37.840> again<00:01:38.109> so<00:01:38.380> i<00:01:38.619> think<00:01:38.979> it's<00:01:39.219> a<00:01:39.399> it's

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
with humans again so i think it's a it's

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.700

a<00:01:39.820> sort<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.210> back<00:01:40.420> pocket<00:01:40.689> plan<00:01:41.109> for<00:01:41.350> NASA<00:01:41.560> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
a sort of a back pocket plan for NASA to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.289 
a sort of a back pocket plan for NASA to
do<00:01:41.920> something<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.490> next<00:01:42.609> ten<00:01:42.850> years<00:01:42.880> I

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
do something in the next ten years I

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.419 
do something in the next ten years I
don't<00:01:43.869> think<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.619> current<00:01:44.950> budget<00:01:45.219> track

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
don't think on the current budget track

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.649 
don't think on the current budget track
that<00:01:45.609> we're<00:01:45.729> headed<00:01:45.909> on<00:01:46.030> announced<00:01:46.539> yesterday

able to achieve even this could we get

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.800 
able to achieve even this could we get
coordination<00:01:50.920> from<00:01:51.070> private<00:01:51.640> entities<00:01:52.570> as

to plan to take place and they would

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.180 
to plan to take place and they would
also<00:02:06.880> seek<00:02:07.240> international<00:02:07.899> cooperation<00:02:08.440> from

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
some of the pieces of this outpost and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.670 
some of the pieces of this outpost and
then<00:02:12.760> NASA's<00:02:13.180> big<00:02:13.450> new<00:02:13.660> booster<00:02:14.230> rocket<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
then NASA's big new booster rocket and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.410 
then NASA's big new booster rocket and
it's<00:02:14.800> Orion<00:02:15.160> spacecraft<00:02:15.580> would<00:02:16.060> be<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> way

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's Orion spacecraft would be the way

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's Orion spacecraft would be the way
we<00:02:16.450> would<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.110> this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
we would get to this

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.979 
we would get to this
yeah<00:02:18.219> it's<00:02:18.400> pretty<00:02:18.519> cool<00:02:18.760> because<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> l2

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
yeah it's pretty cool because the the l2

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.020 
yeah it's pretty cool because the the l2
area<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.439> you<00:02:20.500> talk<00:02:20.680> about<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:21.069> referred<00:02:22.000> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
area that you talk about is referred to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
area that you talk about is referred to
as<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.239> parking<00:02:22.659> spot<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> good<00:02:23.560> sort<00:02:23.799> of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
as a parking spot that is a good sort of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.979 
as a parking spot that is a good sort of
stable<00:02:24.370> gravity<00:02:24.760> area<00:02:25.120> where<00:02:25.659> they<00:02:25.780> think

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
stable gravity area where they think

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.660 
stable gravity area where they think
they<00:02:26.079> could<00:02:26.260> build<00:02:26.469> something<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.159> but

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
they could build something like this but

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.270 
they could build something like this but
there's<00:02:27.849> also<00:02:28.030> talk<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.599> from<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.920> Newt

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
there's also talk of from this and Newt

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.890 
there's also talk of from this and Newt
Gingrich<00:02:30.609> got<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.819> lot<00:02:30.969> of<00:02:31.000> heat<00:02:31.269> when<00:02:31.540> he<00:02:31.719> said

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
Gingrich got a lot of heat when he said

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.869 
Gingrich got a lot of heat when he said
he<00:02:32.019> wanted<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.379> build<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.680> moon<00:02:32.859> colony<00:02:33.099> but

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
he wanted to build a moon colony but

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.490 
he wanted to build a moon colony but
there<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.269> some<00:02:34.480> plans<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.109> it<00:02:35.260> sound

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
there are some plans in this it sound

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.050 
there are some plans in this it sound
like<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.889> basically<00:02:36.189> building<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:36.939> on<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
like that basically building it on a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.000 
like that basically building it on a
regular<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.810> think<00:02:38.019> it's<00:02:38.139> called<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:38.530> rock

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
regular I think it's called a rock

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.099 
regular I think it's called a rock
platform<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.879> moon<00:02:40.209> maybe<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.019> could

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
platform on the moon maybe you could

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.920 
platform on the moon maybe you could
build<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.409> from<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.889> piece<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.489> equipment

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
build it from this piece of equipment

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.289 
build it from this piece of equipment
well<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.379> get<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> El<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.040> your<00:02:45.549> 60,000

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
well if you get to El to your 60,000

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.459 
well if you get to El to your 60,000
miles<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.750> far<00:02:46.930> side<00:02:47.139> of<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.319> Moon

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
miles on the far side of the Moon

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.750 
miles on the far side of the Moon
there's<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> corresponding<00:02:48.069> point<00:02:48.579> on<00:02:48.639> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
there's a corresponding point on the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.610 
there's a corresponding point on the
near<00:02:48.909> side<00:02:48.939> these<00:02:49.629> are<00:02:49.780> gateways<00:02:50.260> where<00:02:50.560> you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
near side these are gateways where you

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740 
near side these are gateways where you
can<00:02:50.769> go<00:02:50.859> outward<00:02:51.250> or<00:02:51.669> you<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:51.970> drop<00:02:52.239> down<00:02:52.510> to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
can go outward or you can drop down to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.659 
can go outward or you can drop down to
the<00:02:52.870> moon's<00:02:53.049> surface<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.919> you're<00:02:54.310> at<00:02:54.459> these

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
the moon's surface so if you're at these

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.940 
the moon's surface so if you're at these
outposts<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.629> can<00:02:55.780> then<00:02:55.959> move<00:02:56.470> down<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.919> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
outposts you can then move down to the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.860 
outposts you can then move down to the
lunar<00:02:57.220> surface<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.669> we<00:02:57.700> change<00:02:58.060> our<00:02:58.359> plans<00:02:58.659> and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
lunar surface if we change our plans and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.750 
lunar surface if we change our plans and
become<00:02:59.200> more<00:02:59.230> ambitious<00:02:59.889> in<00:03:00.040> space<00:03:00.280> as<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.579> hope

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
become more ambitious in space as I hope

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.979 
become more ambitious in space as I hope
we<00:03:00.909> will<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:01.689> you<00:03:01.840> might<00:03:01.989> be<00:03:02.609> establish<00:03:03.609> a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
we will then you might be establish a

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.179 
we will then you might be establish a
prospecting<00:03:04.989> base<00:03:05.169> on<00:03:05.409> the<00:03:05.500> moon<00:03:05.530> surface<00:03:05.859> to

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
prospecting base on the moon surface to

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.220 
prospecting base on the moon surface to
extract<00:03:06.700> valuable<00:03:07.389> raw<00:03:07.599> materials<00:03:08.079> like

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
extract valuable raw materials like

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.170 
extract valuable raw materials like
water<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.799> metals<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.760> same<00:03:09.939> thing

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
water and metals and the same thing

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.459 
water and metals and the same thing
would<00:03:10.299> be<00:03:10.359> true<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.780> our<00:03:11.200> science

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.469 
would be true of our science

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.649 
would be true of our science
investigations<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.370> could<00:03:12.489> use<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.269> orbital

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
investigations you could use the orbital

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.420 
investigations you could use the orbital
outpost<00:03:13.840> at<00:03:14.260> l2<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.709> then<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.980> lunar<00:03:15.280> surface

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
outpost at l2 and then a lunar surface

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.250 
outpost at l2 and then a lunar surface
space<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.969> uncover<00:03:16.329> new<00:03:16.419> secrets<00:03:16.900> about<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
space to uncover new secrets about the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.830 
space to uncover new secrets about the
moon<00:03:17.439> yeah<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:18.189> use<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.519> word<00:03:18.639> if<00:03:18.879> quite<00:03:19.780> a

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
moon yeah you use the word if quite a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.780 
moon yeah you use the word if quite a
bit<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.530> love<00:03:20.799> that<00:03:20.829> word<00:03:21.099> when<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.370> use<00:03:21.609> it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
bit and I love that word when you use it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.129 
bit and I love that word when you use it
because<00:03:21.940> astronauts<00:03:22.599> have<00:03:22.720> been<00:03:22.840> using<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
because astronauts have been using the

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.719 
because astronauts have been using the
word<00:03:23.290> if<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.829> they've<00:03:23.979> been<00:03:24.099> achieving<00:03:24.579> it

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
word if and they've been achieving it

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.210 
word if and they've been achieving it
for<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.120> long<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:26.319> Tom<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:26.709> an<00:03:26.799> exciting

proposition<00:03:27.400> we'll<00:03:27.909> see<00:03:28.060> where<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.239> goes

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
proposition we'll see where it goes

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.790 
proposition we'll see where it goes
