get them to interact and here's how we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.560 
get them to interact and here's how we
do<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
do it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
do it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
you're seeing it kind of tilted like

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this because that is in true north that

building model RVT but that topo surface
you're<00:01:01.050> seeing<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.649> since<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you're seeing there since it's in the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
link they cannot interact with each

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980 
link they cannot interact with each
other<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> change<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.360> process<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
other so I have to change my process a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.359 
other so I have to change my process a
little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.740> they're<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.070> different

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
little bit when they're in two different

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
little bit when they're in two different
files<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> let's<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.409> kind<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> simple

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
files so let's make this kind of simple

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
files so let's make this kind of simple
for<00:01:11.280> ourselves<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> rectangular

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for ourselves just a rectangular

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
for ourselves just a rectangular
building<00:01:13.770> I'll<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> base

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
building I'll make it go with a base

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
building I'll make it go with a base
offset<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.200> negative<00:01:16.619> 12<00:01:16.979> feet

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
offset of like negative 12 feet

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
offset of like negative 12 feet
something<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.420> goes<00:01:18.570> down<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
something like that so it goes down to a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.820 
something like that so it goes down to a
basement<00:01:20.869> do<00:01:21.869> rectangular<00:01:22.470> building

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
basement do rectangular building

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
basement do rectangular building
something<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> want

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
something like that and then if you want

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
something like that and then if you want
to<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.630> look<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> over<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.409> 3d<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to we can look at it over in 3d here and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
to we can look at it over in 3d here and
you'll<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> did<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.960> cut

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you'll see that it did not actually cut

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.850 
you'll see that it did not actually cut
the<00:01:31.380> toposurface<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> here's<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> point<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
the toposurface so here's the point is

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
the toposurface so here's the point is
they<00:01:34.860> don't<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> react<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.240> each

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
they don't even know to react with each

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
they don't even know to react with each
other<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> point<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.860> tried<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> pick

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
other at this point if I tried to pick

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
other at this point if I tried to pick
on<00:01:38.820> building<00:01:39.240> patted<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.780> grayed<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.110> right

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
on building patted be grayed out right

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
on building patted be grayed out right
now<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> button<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.579> accessible<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> me

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
now the button is not accessible to me

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.100 
now the button is not accessible to me
so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> hit<00:01:43.890> save<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.990> go

other person's hat if it's somebody else

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
other person's hat if it's somebody else
where<00:01:50.850> they're<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.270> seeing<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.930> building<00:01:52.350> pad

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
where they're now seeing my building pad

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310 
where they're now seeing my building pad
is<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> link<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is a link but they can use it as a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.609 
is a link but they can use it as a
tracing<00:01:56.070> around<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> building<00:01:57.840> pad<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
tracing around for the building pad that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.520 
tracing around for the building pad that
they<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.130> create<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.270> file<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.469> has

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
they can create with the file that has

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.940 
they can create with the file that has
the<00:02:02.040> toposurface<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the toposurface in it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.029 
the toposurface in it
so<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.729> go<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.909> our<00:02:05.030> massing<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.719> site<00:02:05.780> tab

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
so we go to our massing and site tab

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.259 
so we go to our massing and site tab
there's<00:02:07.039> where<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.430> toposurface<00:02:07.729> was

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
there's where the toposurface was

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.479 
there's where the toposurface was
created<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.349> there's<00:02:09.590> building<00:02:10.009> pad<00:02:10.250> as<00:02:10.459> a

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
created and there's building pad as a

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.320 
created and there's building pad as a
choice<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:11.269> puts<00:02:11.480> me<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.810> mode<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:13.580> draw

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
choice it puts me in a mode I can draw

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330 
choice it puts me in a mode I can draw
around<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.810> outside<00:02:15.230> boundary<00:02:15.739> or<00:02:15.890> use<00:02:16.099> one

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
around the outside boundary or use one

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.490 
around the outside boundary or use one

of the other tools if I so desire I'm

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.690 
of the other tools if I so desire I'm
just<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.069> around<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.670> outside

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
just going to go around the outside

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
feet to make the building pad go down

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.479 
feet to make the building pad go down
that<00:02:34.549> far<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:36.590> say<00:02:36.830> finish<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:37.400> the

that far and then say finish with the
check<00:02:37.700> mark<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.209> see<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.540> they're

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
check mark you can see that they're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.520 
check mark you can see that they're
already<00:02:38.930> cut<00:02:39.260> my<00:02:40.000> contours<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.079> I<00:02:42.200> look<00:02:42.380> at

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
already cut my contours and if I look at

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.370 
already cut my contours and if I look at
it<00:02:42.709> 3d<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.970> see<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.480> dips<00:02:44.750> down<00:02:45.049> in

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it 3d you can see that it dips down in

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.449 
it 3d you can see that it dips down in
now<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.130> 12<00:02:46.370> feet<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.910> asked<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:48.459> even

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
now the 12 feet that I asked it to even

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
now the 12 feet that I asked it to even
though<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.579> building<00:02:49.970> walls<00:02:50.540> are<00:02:51.049> in<00:02:51.260> another

though the building walls are in another

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.850 
though the building walls are in another

on<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.610> close<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.269> go<00:02:56.329> back<00:02:56.599> over<00:02:56.630> to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
on this and close it and go back over to

on this and close it and go back over to
the<00:02:57.110> building<00:02:57.290> files<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.099> see<00:02:58.370> how

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
the building files so you can see how

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.490 
the building files so you can see how
this<00:02:58.700> turned<00:02:59.360> out<00:02:59.599> you're<00:02:59.840> back<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.319> other

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
look at it from another angle yet before

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.229 
look at it from another angle yet before
we<00:03:26.480> finish<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> right<00:03:28.310> click<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.910> go<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
we finish so right click on it go to

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.170 
we finish so right click on it go to
view<00:03:29.920> maybe<00:03:30.920> change<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.430> scale<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.000> at

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
view maybe change the scale it's at

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.699 
view maybe change the scale it's at
one-inch<00:03:32.510> equal<00:03:32.780> 20<00:03:33.079> feet<00:03:33.319> I've<00:03:33.530> got<00:03:33.680> a

one-inch equal 20 feet I've got a
quarter-inch<00:03:34.100> scale<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.790> see<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
quarter-inch scale so you can see the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.650 
quarter-inch scale so you can see the
poche<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.069> know<00:03:37.069> indeed<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.239> did<00:03:38.450> not

fill in so um hopefully you'll join me

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.019 
fill in so um hopefully you'll join me
again<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.470> another<00:03:42.730> Revit<00:03:43.730> tip<00:03:43.940> soon<00:03:44.269> thanks
