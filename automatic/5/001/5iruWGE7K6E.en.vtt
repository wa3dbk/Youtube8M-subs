 here is the video tutorial that reveals you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.990
 my strategy we find ourselves in this 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.870
 table of course after having registered 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.790
 at the first tried and tested first casino 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 we said to turn the roulette wheel to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.170
 empty until one and three come out 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.170
 following zero numbers 31 32 34 or 35 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.920
 so to start the roulette just 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.920
 simply click on the spin button 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.300
 17 odd black is the number of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.800
 bets but it is not one of the numbers that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 we are waiting 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:01:02.120
 so let's click on the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:04.190
 button turns a red tiebreaker 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.080
 the number one came out from you and neither 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.830
 this is one of the numbers there 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.899
 affect 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.899
 then we click on turn 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 14 red bari came out the 14th will be one 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.220
 time it is no three numbers that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.930
 we are waiting 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:35.439
 we therefore continue to focus on 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:38.320
 interesting red round 34 which is the v 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:52.709 --> 00:02:04.450
 on the third on the fourth and on the fifth 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.330
 then we move to the third row 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.819
 We bet 3 5 euro chips in this 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 point so as to have a coverage of the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.670

 at this point having won 20 euros 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.660
 we have to abandon the first casino for 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.510
 go and register for the second and then the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.940
 third casino I tested by repeating 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.620
