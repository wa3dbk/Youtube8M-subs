00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello dear fans, the time has come 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 and the next game of baskets 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.379
 I started thinking before 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.870
 we welcome our again 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 birthday boy of the week jason boone 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 yes, this week has become 27 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.960
 everything good afterwards only after 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:26.150
 morbid you can have a nice party you have 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:26.150
 So made a little party for hours 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 did not have next weekend 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.640
 How do you like to have presents 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.350
 maybe also on America from his 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 get family or what does it look like 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:54.149
 it was a rarity and me 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.649
 had also on yours 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.109
 hometown to speak come you come 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.680
 out 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.109
 Maybe you can do it a bit 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 compare what is so different than in 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.719
 würzburg or what also likes in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 würzburg maybe that's good there 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.619
 does not exist 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 So last year I had the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 the stock has become clear and a dryer and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.360
 By showing my university I was 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 in the skull but it is a 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.790
 other star so new york city is like that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 big and as long as you can not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.409
 sleep and there but in the office, the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.829
 is a small village is that is quite 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 good but that is only in the middle 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.960
 It is a big city but it is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 not so big from a york 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.330
 that's relaxation it's been heard 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.119
 the defense knows you and that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 is very very nice gates gates 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.560
 now it has been in for a year now 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.759
 würzburg maybe you can give me something 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.360
 Do you like it here especially well? 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380
 maybe any 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 Attractions was on 17 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.220
 the whole street we have in the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 seen a residence and that is a very 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.820
 nice location or museum 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.350
 I think the start of wine festival 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:26.519
 or painting that is that is quite a whole 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:28.830
 great women the software but I 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.710
 have a good time here in the States 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 the relationships, the women 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.440
 I also need to talk again 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.580
 should that be the food there is yes 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.900
 also eat completely different than 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.950
 probably here in the usa's 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.880
 Franconian food rumbles handles yes so 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 I love it but here in question 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 Asked my favorite food is this 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.050
 Of course, it's also important to be fit 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.030
 and that 's why it's about it now 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.460
 at the same time you expect the game 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.350
 now from the game against this so me 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.780
 really hope a victory martin 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.320
 we did not play that well in 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.470
 our first home game and is it 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.120
 important if we want the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.970
 team we want to be 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.830
 we had to win at home but what 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.840
 the design should be an important game for you 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.280
 How do you motivate us so directly ? 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.750
 maybe you have music before the game 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.530
 you need your rest like 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.010
 does that work out for you yes so every one for 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:35.280
 Everybody is difficult to get out of the way 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.680
 group from the overlooked but as I said 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.090
 easily the game starts when you then 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.840
 Wins in helps even more weather 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.760
 a little bit celebrated 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.050
 oh well that is that it was one 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 but we have to do it first 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.420
 our work and win at home 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.710
 I'll come back to the best 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.690
 speak as said the best comes to 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.950
 conclusion that the fans support 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.090
 you really always very much at the hall 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.020
 many also go on the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.600
 away games 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.040
 what does that mean for you player 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.090
 is the whole through are very very 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.450
 motivated and and that is an important one 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.710
 choice if the game is clear for us 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.640
 Thanks a lot, it will not say 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.200
 you will have that again 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.200
 size difference here I call it 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.140
 So already around the 40 centimeters 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.140
 Bigger is not wrong 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.499
 [Music] 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.499
 [Applause] 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.720
 Oh, in the next game 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:05.340
 I stand here, we have come so 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.960
 thanked directly so it has to 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.340
 go ahead with jason boone this hot 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 at stake and now come the same 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.350
 players have fun while playing 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.350
 that is
