set<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.220> hexadecimal<00:03:19.760> base<00:03:20.090> value<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.690> 1

set it to a hexadecimal base value of 1

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.230 
set it to a hexadecimal base value of 1
so<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.450> should<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:23.810> tcp<00:03:24.320> no<00:03:24.470> delay<00:03:24.710> D<00:03:25.370> word<00:03:25.580> 1

so you should have tcp no delay D word 1

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.660
