right here and that opens up to your

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.990 
right here and that opens up to your
secondary<00:01:31.020> mSATA<00:01:31.560> slot<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.790> neat<00:01:35.000> pretty

secondary mSATA slot pretty neat pretty
easy<00:01:36.119> access<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.960> screw<00:01:37.820> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
easy access there's just one screw and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.370

then you get to the big panel just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.340 
then you get to the big panel just
basically<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.170> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
basically just you know once you get out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
basically just you know once you get out
here<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.310> other<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:47.850> two

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here it's in these other two or two two

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
here it's in these other two or two two
screws<00:01:48.720> each<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.920> you've<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.729> know

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
screws each this one you've got you know

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
screws each this one you've got you know
I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.360> six<00:01:51.659> screws<00:01:51.930> along<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I think it's six screws along here and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
I think it's six screws along here and
then<00:01:54.079> one<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.110> each<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:57.049> right<00:01:58.049> by

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
then one on each one of these right by

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
then one on each one of these right by
the<00:01:58.229> vents<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.250> then<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.899> pull<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.930> away

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the vents and then you just pull it away

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.480 
the vents and then you just pull it away
like<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.799> voila

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
like that and voila

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.550 
like that and voila

I<00:02:10.890> used<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.340> put<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.640> ones<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> keyboard<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
I used I put the ones on the keyboard so

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
I used I put the ones on the keyboard so
that<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.800> ever<00:02:13.920> wanted<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> add<00:02:14.340> later<00:02:14.580> it'd

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
that if I ever wanted to add later it'd

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.589 
that if I ever wanted to add later it'd
be<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> lot<00:02:15.030> easier<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.420> add

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
be a lot easier to add

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.460 
on it and then you have what looks to be
five<00:03:29.170> screws<00:03:29.829> here<00:03:30.600> take<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.690> keyboard<00:03:32.140> off

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470

said<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.359> put<00:03:55.569> my<00:03:55.690> RAM<00:03:55.870> here<00:03:56.700> because<00:03:57.700> it's<00:03:57.819> a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
said I put my RAM here because it's a

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.490 
said I put my RAM here because it's a
lot<00:03:58.060> easier<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.540> get<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> other<00:03:59.109> other

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
lot easier to get to the other other

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.800 
lot easier to get to the other other
side<00:03:59.910> plus<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.000> have<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.269> no<00:04:01.389> need<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.720> ever

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
side plus I have really no need to ever

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.270 
side plus I have really no need to ever
access<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:02.350> unless<00:04:02.590> I'm<00:04:02.769> replacing<00:04:03.010> a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
access this unless I'm replacing a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.979 
access this unless I'm replacing a
wireless<00:04:03.609> card<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.030> got<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.299> AC<00:04:04.450> Intel

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
wireless card and I got the AC Intel

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.800 
wireless card and I got the AC Intel
card<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.440> don't<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.769> worry<00:04:05.950> about<00:04:06.010> that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
card so I don't have to worry about that

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.900 
card so I don't have to worry about that
cache<00:04:07.810> latency<00:04:08.200> ten<00:04:08.470> RAM<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.670> I'll<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:09.819> to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
cache latency ten RAM so I'll have to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.180 
cache latency ten RAM so I'll have to
worry<00:04:10.030> about<00:04:10.150> replacing<00:04:10.329> that<00:04:10.569> as<00:04:10.780> well<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
worry about replacing that as well so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.830 
worry about replacing that as well so
