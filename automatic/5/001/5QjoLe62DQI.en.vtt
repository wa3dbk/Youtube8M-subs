boat the BOA is a significant upgrade in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.020 
boat the BOA is a significant upgrade in
this<00:01:07.590> skate<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> new<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.909> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this skate because it's a new kind of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
this skate because it's a new kind of
lacing<00:01:09.420> system<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:10.530> inline<00:01:11.040> skates<00:01:11.430> however

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
lacing system for inline skates however

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
lacing system for inline skates however
the<00:01:11.939> BOA<00:01:12.119> system<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.689> been<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.470> many

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the BOA system has been around for many

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.070 
the BOA system has been around for many
many<00:01:13.799> years<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.580> snowboard<00:01:15.390> boots<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.990> ice

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
many years in snowboard boots and ice

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.450 
many years in snowboard boots and ice
skates<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> other<00:01:16.799> types<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> sports

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
skates and other types of sports

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
skates and other types of sports
equipment<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.020> proven<00:01:19.439> system

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
equipment so it's a well proven system

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
equipment so it's a well proven system
and<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> does<00:01:20.549> exactly<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.810> has

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and what it does exactly is it has

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
and what it does exactly is it has
cables<00:01:22.560> instead<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.040> laces<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:24.060> run

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cables instead of laces which run

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
cables instead of laces which run
through<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> skate<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.890> dial

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
through the skate up to this little dial

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950 
through the skate up to this little dial
when<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.420> foot<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
when you go to put your foot in the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
when you go to put your foot in the
skate<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> simply<00:01:28.740> pop<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.250> BOA<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.729> work

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
skate you simply pop the BOA for work

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.609 
skate you simply pop the BOA for work
and<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> allows<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.990> laces<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> release

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
and that allows the laces to release

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.749 
and that allows the laces to release
guess<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.829> take<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> upper<00:01:35.460> buckle

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
guess if you take off the upper buckle

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.090 
guess if you take off the upper buckle
it's<00:01:35.880> easier<00:01:36.210> those<00:01:36.810> laces<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.500> release<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it's easier those laces to release and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's easier those laces to release and
get<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.880> foot<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.060> nice<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.360> easy<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
get your foot in nice and easy then you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
get your foot in nice and easy then you
pop<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> bow<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.450> into<00:01:42.750> place<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
pop the bow of back into place and you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
pop the bow of back into place and you
twist<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.610> cable<00:01:45.090> reps<00:01:45.420> inside<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
twist it and the cable reps inside of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.429 
twist it and the cable reps inside of
the<00:01:46.350> BOA<00:01:46.530> real<00:01:46.979> nicely<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.439> uniformly

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the BOA real nicely and it uniformly

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
the BOA real nicely and it uniformly
tightens<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> cable<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> way<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
tightens the cable all the way up the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.749 
tightens the cable all the way up the
skate<00:01:51.630> giving<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.320> only<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.860> uniform
