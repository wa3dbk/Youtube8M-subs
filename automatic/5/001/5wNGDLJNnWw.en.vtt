a lot of fun hey I didn't see any real
downsides<00:02:10.269> besides<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> fact<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.560> can

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
downsides besides the fact that it can

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.170 
downsides besides the fact that it can
almost<00:02:12.190> even<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.849> little<00:02:12.970> bit<00:02:13.090> more

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
almost even on a little bit more

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030 
almost even on a little bit more
difficult<00:02:13.360> settings<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.500> too<00:02:14.709> easy

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
difficult settings get a little too easy

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.210 
difficult settings get a little too easy
yeah<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:17.170> were<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.349> biggest<00:02:17.650> counterparts

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
yeah what were your biggest counterparts

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.740 
yeah what were your biggest counterparts
I<00:02:18.400> guess<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.790> only<00:02:18.879> downfall<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.569> would

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
I guess the only downfall that I would

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.960 
I guess the only downfall that I would
find<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.459> get<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:21.760> confusing

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
find is it can get a little confusing

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
find is it can get a little confusing
trying<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.599> figure<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.840> where<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.019> go<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.040> map

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
isn't the most helpful it's just a

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.870 
isn't the most helpful it's just a
generic<00:02:26.200> arrow<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:27.220> doors<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:27.700> not
