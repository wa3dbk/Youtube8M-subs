00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.460 

I<00:00:10.560> use<00:00:11.560> funny<00:00:11.770> quite<00:00:12.040> exciting<00:00:12.520> I<00:00:12.580> think<00:00:12.820> and

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
I use funny quite exciting I think and

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.680 
I use funny quite exciting I think and
sort<00:00:14.470> of<00:00:14.530> Technology<00:00:15.209> some<00:00:16.209> sort<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.540> play

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
sort of Technology some sort of play

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.230 
sort of Technology some sort of play
with<00:00:16.720> my<00:00:16.960> bike<00:00:17.290> and<00:00:17.590> things<00:00:17.860> my<00:00:18.160> toys<00:00:18.400> I<00:00:18.700> was

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
with my bike and things my toys I was

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.340 
with my bike and things my toys I was
just<00:00:19.360> be<00:00:19.480> quite<00:00:19.660> interested<00:00:19.960> in<00:00:20.020> sort<00:00:20.170> of<00:00:20.200> what

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
just be quite interested in sort of what

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.530 
just be quite interested in sort of what
made<00:00:20.529> them<00:00:20.650> work<00:00:20.860> sort<00:00:21.220> of<00:00:21.310> behind<00:00:21.880> behind<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
made them work sort of behind behind the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.450 
made them work sort of behind behind the
scenes<00:00:22.750> so<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:23.410> guess<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:23.800> kind<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.130> always<00:00:24.279> had

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
scenes so I guess I kind of always had

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.010 
scenes so I guess I kind of always had
that<00:00:24.580> kind<00:00:24.790> of<00:00:24.820> curiosity<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.660> know<00:00:25.689> how

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
that kind of curiosity to know how

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.109 
that kind of curiosity to know how
things<00:00:26.170> work<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:27.189> really<00:00:27.400> science<00:00:27.790> is<00:00:27.910> kind

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
things work and really science is kind

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.510 
things work and really science is kind
of<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:29.020> the<00:00:29.050> thing<00:00:29.710> that<00:00:29.860> sort<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.160> explains

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
of the the thing that sort of explains

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.150 
of the the thing that sort of explains
that<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.029> guess

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 

I<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.030> journey<00:00:36.270> into<00:00:36.510> becoming<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I think my journey into becoming a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
I think my journey into becoming a
scientist<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.040> gain<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:38.760> engineering<00:00:38.940> was

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
scientist and gain into engineering was

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.950 
scientist and gain into engineering was
probably<00:00:39.480> quite<00:00:39.690> by<00:00:40.200> accident<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:41.960> although

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
probably quite by accident I although

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.049 
probably quite by accident I although
had<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.200> interest<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.890> how<00:00:44.220> things<00:00:44.489> work<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
had this interest in how things work I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.400 
had this interest in how things work I
didn't<00:00:45.450> ever<00:00:45.629> think<00:00:45.720> I'd<00:00:45.960> become<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.290> engineer

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
didn't ever think I'd become an engineer

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
didn't ever think I'd become an engineer
and<00:00:46.650> like<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> studied

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and like that and so I studied

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
and like that and so I studied
psychology<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.860> studied<00:00:50.250> sociology<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> very

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
psychology I studied sociology and very

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.210 
psychology I studied sociology and very
much<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.199> softer<00:00:52.530> sore<00:00:52.769> subjects

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
much this little softer sore subjects

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.460 
much this little softer sore subjects
and<00:00:53.519> it's<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:53.970> when<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.019> realized<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
and it's only when I kind of realized I

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.390 
and it's only when I kind of realized I
was<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.739> bit<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.949> bridge<00:00:56.190> between

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
was a little bit of a bridge between

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400 
was a little bit of a bridge between
psychology<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.420> engineering<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.080> this<00:00:58.199> world

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
psychology and engineering in this world

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
psychology and engineering in this world
of<00:00:58.559> ergonomics<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.760> my<00:01:00.269> kind<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
of ergonomics that my kind of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
of ergonomics that my kind of
professional<00:01:01.470> interest<00:01:01.860> actually<00:01:02.190> emerged

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
professional interest actually emerged

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
professional interest actually emerged
through<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.360> probably<00:01:03.629> through

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
through that so it's probably through

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100 
through that so it's probably through
University<00:01:04.410> in<00:01:04.470> quite<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.190> accident<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:06.110> feed

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
University in quite by accident but feed

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
University in quite by accident but feed
me<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.410> germ<00:01:07.649> of<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.890> idea<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.460> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
me on that germ of an idea from when I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
me on that germ of an idea from when I
was<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.790> kid<00:01:08.940> really

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.510 

okay<00:01:13.900> well<00:01:14.050> i'm<00:01:14.140> currently<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.890> lecturer<00:01:15.100> in

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
okay well i'm currently a lecturer in

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.220 
okay well i'm currently a lecturer in
human<00:01:15.910> factors<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.330> ergonomics<00:01:16.630> here<00:01:17.170> at

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
human factors and ergonomics here at

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.320 
human factors and ergonomics here at
university<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:17.890> that's<00:01:18.490> my<00:01:18.640> kind<00:01:18.910> of<00:01:18.970> daily

personal<00:01:36.780> research<00:01:37.780> interest<00:01:38.290> which<00:01:38.470> is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
personal research interest which is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.690 
personal research interest which is
through<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> University<00:01:39.550> which<00:01:39.670> is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
through the University which is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.180 
through the University which is
motorcycle<00:01:40.420> ergonomics<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.680> idea<00:01:41.710> that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
motorcycle ergonomics so the idea that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.920 
motorcycle ergonomics so the idea that
we<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.610> actually<00:01:42.880> understand<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.720> way<00:01:43.810> that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
we can actually understand the way that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.770 
we can actually understand the way that
people<00:01:43.990> are<00:01:44.290> technology<00:01:45.030> interacts<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.330> for

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
people are technology interacts and for

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.060 
people are technology interacts and for
motorcycling<00:01:47.320> very<00:01:47.740> little<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
motorcycling very little this is

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.219 
motorcycling very little this is
understood<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.420> there's<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.050> lot<00:01:50.200> of

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
understood so that there's a lot of

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.200 
understood so that there's a lot of
research<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.590> be<00:01:50.800> done<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.580> understand<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
research to be done to understand the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.840 
research to be done to understand the
issues<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.720> riding<00:01:53.170> motorbikes<00:01:53.380> safely<00:01:53.979> and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
issues of riding motorbikes safely and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
issues of riding motorbikes safely and
the<00:01:54.880> kid<00:01:55.150> that<00:01:55.270> people<00:01:55.540> use<00:01:55.750> on<00:01:55.960> motorbikes

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480 

I<00:02:00.380> think<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.980> interesting<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.460> about

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I think the the interesting thing about

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.430 
I think the the interesting thing about
working<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.880> University<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.660> one<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
working at University and one of the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.620 
working at University and one of the
best<00:02:04.590> things<00:02:04.740> about<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.920> job<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.370> that<00:02:05.700> it's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
best things about a job is that it's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.840 
best things about a job is that it's
quite<00:02:06.960> an<00:02:07.020> applied<00:02:07.320> nature<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.369> work<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
quite an applied nature that we work in

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.050 
quite an applied nature that we work in

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.310 
enjoy the teaching side actually
applying<00:02:26.310> knowledge<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:27.600> students<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
applying knowledge to students and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.380 
applying knowledge to students and
developing<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.220> them<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> skills<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.300> off

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
developing in them the skills to go off

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.979 
developing in them the skills to go off
and<00:02:30.540> enquire<00:02:30.900> themselves<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:32.959> various<00:02:33.959> ways

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
and enquire themselves in various ways

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.750 
and enquire themselves in various ways
which<00:02:34.320> they<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.550> me<00:02:35.640> it's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
which they want to so that for me it's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.520 
which they want to so that for me it's
really<00:02:35.880> satisfying<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.600> teach<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> course

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
really satisfying when I teach a course

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.699 
really satisfying when I teach a course
well<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.850> good<00:02:38.970> feedback<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:40.230> also

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
well when I get good feedback but also

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.140 
well when I get good feedback but also
just<00:02:40.830> very<00:02:41.130> much<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> applied<00:02:41.640> nature<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
just very much the applied nature that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.229 
just very much the applied nature that
doing<00:02:42.510> something<00:02:42.959> worthwhile<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.980> think<00:02:44.370> we're

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
doing something worthwhile I think we're

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
doing something worthwhile I think we're
the<00:02:45.300> worst<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.080> students<00:02:46.860> who<00:02:47.040> keep

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the worst thing is is students who keep

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.590 
the worst thing is is students who keep
knocking<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> door<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.120> asking<00:02:48.360> silly

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
knocking on the door and asking silly

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.990 
knocking on the door and asking silly
questions<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:49.430> don't<00:02:50.430> mind<00:02:50.520> really<00:02:50.700> knock<00:02:50.910> on

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
questions I don't mind really knock on

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.430 
questions I don't mind really knock on
my<00:02:51.090> door<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.330> any<00:02:51.390> time<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.080> somebody's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
my door at any time but if somebody's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.600 
my door at any time but if somebody's
asking<00:02:52.560> me<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.800> third<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.400> third<00:02:53.580> time

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
asking me the third for the third time

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.090 
asking me the third for the third time
the<00:02:54.030> same<00:02:54.180> question<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.770> it's<00:02:55.920> quite

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
the same question you know it's quite

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.260 
the same question you know it's quite
nice<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> actually<00:02:56.640> learned<00:02:56.850> something<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
nice it actually learned something and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.300 
nice it actually learned something and
actually<00:02:57.690> sort<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.680> after<00:02:58.860> them<00:02:58.980> settles

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
actually sort of after them settles

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.010 
actually sort of after them settles
after<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.550> while<00:02:59.730> well<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:00.600> usually<00:03:00.750> quite

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
after a while well I'm usually quite

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.210 
after a while well I'm usually quite
approachable<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.500> think<00:03:01.680> every<00:03:01.860> would<00:03:01.980> say<00:03:02.130> I'm

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
approachable I think every would say I'm

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.640 
approachable I think every would say I'm
fairly<00:03:02.400> approachable<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:03.290> probably<00:03:04.290> ate<00:03:04.350> less

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
fairly approachable I probably ate less

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.050 
fairly approachable I probably ate less
and<00:03:04.860> less<00:03:04.950> patient<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:05.519> people<00:03:05.549> learn<00:03:06.030> more

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and less patient with people learn more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.340 
and less patient with people learn more
and<00:03:06.330> more<00:03:06.480> times<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:06.780> come<00:03:06.959> back<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.260> ask

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and more times they come back and ask

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.310 
and more times they come back and ask
the<00:03:07.470> same<00:03:07.620> question

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.510 

okay<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.410> over<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.590> next<00:03:16.620> 12<00:03:16.950> months<00:03:17.100> I've<00:03:17.400> got

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
okay so over the next 12 months I've got

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.160 
okay so over the next 12 months I've got
quite<00:03:17.790> an<00:03:17.880> exciting<00:03:18.150> time<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.810> quite<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.020> big

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
quite an exciting time but quite a big

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.860 
quite an exciting time but quite a big
challenge<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> try<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.100> achieve<00:03:20.720> having<00:03:21.720> won

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
challenge to try and achieve having won

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.140 
challenge to try and achieve having won
some<00:03:22.050> money<00:03:22.080> through<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> university<00:03:22.890> to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
some money through the university to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150 
some money through the university to
develop<00:03:24.150> my<00:03:24.270> research<00:03:24.830> I'm<00:03:25.830> going<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> be

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
develop my research I'm going to be

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.030 
develop my research I'm going to be
building<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.460> motorbike<00:03:26.820> simulator<00:03:27.500> now<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
building a motorbike simulator now the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.200 
building a motorbike simulator now the
idea<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.640> build<00:03:29.820> something<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
idea of that is to build something that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.820 
idea of that is to build something that
actually<00:03:30.450> works<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:31.470> some<00:03:31.650> research

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
actually works and do some research

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.520 
actually works and do some research
within<00:03:32.580> 12<00:03:32.820> months<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.020> kind<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.410> got

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
within 12 months so that's kind of got

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.100 
within 12 months so that's kind of got
to<00:03:34.620> get<00:03:34.709> done<00:03:35.360> alongside<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.600> I've<00:03:36.930> also

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
to get done alongside that I've also

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.680 
to get done alongside that I've also
just<00:03:37.530> got<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.680> research<00:03:38.100> group<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.760> students<00:03:39.540> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
just got a research group of students to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690 
just got a research group of students to
do<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> project<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.500> they're<00:03:40.980> building<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
do a project and they're building the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.240 
do a project and they're building the
next<00:03:41.850> generation<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.570> simulator

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
next generation of the simulator

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.780 
next generation of the simulator
something<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> little<00:03:44.490> bit<00:03:44.640> more

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
something that's a little bit more

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.670 
something that's a little bit more
dynamic<00:03:45.390> more<00:03:45.690> interactive<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.500> rider

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
dynamic more interactive with the rider

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.060 
dynamic more interactive with the rider
so<00:03:47.370> hopefully<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:47.880> will<00:03:48.030> hope<00:03:49.070> well

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
so hopefully that will hope well

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.350 
so hopefully that will hope well
hopefully<00:03:50.280> sort<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.700> vm<00:03:53.000> okay<00:03:54.000> well<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.239> idea

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
hopefully sort of vm okay well the idea

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.810 
hopefully sort of vm okay well the idea
of<00:03:54.630> most<00:03:54.780> my<00:03:54.900> simulator<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.700> something<00:03:56.700> which

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
of most my simulator is something which

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.390 
of most my simulator is something which
you<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:57.180> sit<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.870> ride<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.130> fairly

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
you can sit on and ride in a fairly

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.949 
you can sit on and ride in a fairly
realistic<00:03:59.700> kind<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.180> way<00:04:00.300> they're<00:04:00.540> going<00:04:00.870> to

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
realistic kind of way they're going to

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.930 
realistic kind of way they're going to
be<00:04:01.020> certain<00:04:01.170> limitations<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:02.459> feel<00:04:02.760> like

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
be certain limitations but feel like

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.890 
be certain limitations but feel like
you're<00:04:03.060> actually<00:04:03.120> riding<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.570> motorbike

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
you're actually riding a motorbike

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.270 
you're actually riding a motorbike
although<00:04:04.500> you're<00:04:04.650> not<00:04:04.739> actually<00:04:04.860> out<00:04:05.070> on<00:04:05.100> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
although you're not actually out on the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.949 
although you're not actually out on the
road<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.090> much<00:04:06.300> like<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> car<00:04:06.690> simulator

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
road so it's much like a car simulator

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.310 
road so it's much like a car simulator
on<00:04:07.709> aircraft<00:04:08.040> simulator<00:04:08.610> you're<00:04:09.330> taking<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
on aircraft simulator you're taking the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.290 
on aircraft simulator you're taking the
sort<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.860> important<00:04:11.190> aspects<00:04:11.520> of<00:04:11.670> riding<00:04:12.120> or

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
sort of important aspects of riding or

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.750 
sort of important aspects of riding or
you<00:04:12.450> riding<00:04:13.260> them<00:04:13.470> with<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.709> bike<00:04:13.890> or<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.670> know

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
you riding them with a bike or you know

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.550 
you riding them with a bike or you know
flying<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.060> aircraft<00:04:15.270> drive<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.750> car<00:04:15.930> but

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
flying the aircraft drive the car but

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.539 
flying the aircraft drive the car but
putting<00:04:16.769> them<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.010> fairly<00:04:17.220> safe

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
putting them in a fairly safe

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.979 
putting them in a fairly safe
environment<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.450> we<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.720> she<00:04:18.840> do

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
environment so that we can she do

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.240 
environment so that we can she do
research<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:21.979> generalizes<00:04:22.979> out<00:04:23.130> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
research that then generalizes out to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.040 
research that then generalizes out to
the<00:04:23.340> main<00:04:23.490> road<00:04:23.520> users<00:04:24.150> without<00:04:24.570> actually<00:04:24.930> put

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
the main road users without actually put

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610 
the main road users without actually put
them<00:04:25.140> in<00:04:25.229> dangerous<00:04:25.500> situations

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.680 

I<00:04:29.760> think<00:04:30.760> I'd<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> see

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
I think I'd really like to see

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.800 
I think I'd really like to see
motorcycle<00:04:32.290> ergonomics<00:04:32.830> become<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:34.030> kind<00:04:34.600> of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
motorcycle ergonomics become a kind of

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.960 
motorcycle ergonomics become a kind of
established<00:04:35.380> saveria<00:04:35.949> research<00:04:36.430> at<00:04:36.880> the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
established saveria research at the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.310 
established saveria research at the
moment<00:04:37.360> there's<00:04:37.510> very<00:04:37.750> little<00:04:37.870> work<00:04:38.080> out

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
moment there's very little work out

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.800 
moment there's very little work out
there<00:04:38.560> we<00:04:39.490> know<00:04:39.639> very<00:04:39.669> little<00:04:40.060> about<00:04:40.210> what

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
there we know very little about what

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.360 
there we know very little about what
impacts<00:04:41.320> on<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> rider<00:04:41.710> when<00:04:41.949> they're<00:04:42.070> riding<00:04:42.340> a

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
impacts on a rider when they're riding a

impacts on a rider when they're riding a
motorbike<00:04:42.639> from<00:04:43.389> scientific<00:04:43.930> point<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.169> view

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
motorbike from scientific point of view

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.379 
motorbike from scientific point of view
a<00:04:44.320> lot<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.910> information<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.150> there's

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
a lot of the information that there's

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.790 
a lot of the information that there's
very<00:04:46.419> anecdotal<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:47.410> very<00:04:47.620> sort<00:04:47.770> of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
very anecdotal it's very sort of

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.920 
very anecdotal it's very sort of
journalistic<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> magazines<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.780> I'd

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
journalistic for the magazines so I'd

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.570 
journalistic for the magazines so I'd
really<00:04:50.169> like<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.380> establish<00:04:50.590> something<00:04:51.250> that

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
really like to establish something that

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.490 
really like to establish something that
sort<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:51.880> gives<00:04:52.060> us<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.389> sort<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:52.960> academic

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
sort of gives us a sort of academic

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.990 
sort of gives us a sort of academic
basis<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.160> understanding<00:04:54.790> some<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
basis to understanding some of the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.330 
basis to understanding some of the
issues

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.770 

no<00:05:00.340> no<00:05:00.610> I'm<00:05:00.819> actually<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.300> fairly<00:05:01.509> key

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
no no I'm actually a fairly key

no no I'm actually a fairly key
Moustakas<00:05:02.349> myself<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:03.250> guess<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.030> started

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
Moustakas myself I guess I started

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.559 
Moustakas myself I guess I started
riding<00:05:04.509> when<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:04.629> was<00:05:04.840> 19<00:05:05.409> years<00:05:05.440> old<00:05:05.830> so<00:05:06.129> that's

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
riding when I was 19 years old so that's

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.089 
riding when I was 19 years old so that's
20<00:05:07.569> odd<00:05:07.750> years<00:05:07.780> ago<00:05:08.199> had<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> little<00:05:08.889> bit<00:05:09.009> of<00:05:09.039> a

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
20 odd years ago had a little bit of a

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.140 
20 odd years ago had a little bit of a
break<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.460> middle<00:05:09.520> when<00:05:09.759> I<00:05:09.819> was<00:05:09.849> studying

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
break in the middle when I was studying

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.080 
break in the middle when I was studying
at<00:05:10.300> University<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:10.889> drove<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.919> car<00:05:12.190> but<00:05:12.909> in<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
at University and drove a car but in the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.399 
at University and drove a car but in the
last<00:05:13.240> thought<00:05:13.449> four<00:05:13.659> or<00:05:13.750> five<00:05:13.930> years<00:05:13.960> I've<00:05:14.289> got

back into motorcycling taking my

how much more the the road systems

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.570 
how much more the the road systems
change<00:05:20.319> in<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.560> last<00:05:20.710> 20<00:05:21.009> years<00:05:21.190> from<00:05:21.370> when<00:05:21.520> I

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
change in the last 20 years from when I

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.790 
change in the last 20 years from when I
first<00:05:21.639> started<00:05:22.060> right<00:05:22.240> into<00:05:22.479> now<00:05:22.659> now<00:05:23.620> I'm

first started right into now now I'm
riding<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.159> motorbike<00:05:24.370> again

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.040 

that's<00:05:29.550> interesting<00:05:29.910> i<00:05:29.940> think<00:05:30.150> i<00:05:30.360> think<00:05:30.780> when

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
that's interesting i think i think when

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.370 
that's interesting i think i think when
we<00:05:31.080> meet<00:05:31.350> other<00:05:31.560> scientists<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.250> think<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:33.380> think

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
we meet other scientists I think I think

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.140 
we meet other scientists I think I think
we<00:05:34.470> each<00:05:34.620> have<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.860> kind<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.190> area<00:05:35.520> of<00:05:35.580> expertise

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
we each have a kind of area of expertise

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.730 
we each have a kind of area of expertise
that<00:05:36.510> sometimes<00:05:36.960> quite<00:05:37.140> difficult<00:05:37.410> to

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
that sometimes quite difficult to

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.190 
that sometimes quite difficult to
communicate<00:05:37.920> between<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.600> I<00:05:39.630> think<00:05:39.930> one

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
communicate between and so I think one

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.840 
communicate between and so I think one
of<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.320> challenges<00:05:40.350> of<00:05:40.800> silence<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.580> ready<00:05:41.790> to

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
of the challenges of silence is ready to

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.910 
of the challenges of silence is ready to
communicate<00:05:42.270> between<00:05:42.420> different<00:05:43.020> groups<00:05:43.050> not

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
communicate between different groups not

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.800 
communicate between different groups not
only<00:05:44.070> within<00:05:44.520> science<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.090> also<00:05:45.120> outside<00:05:45.390> of

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
only within science but also outside of

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230 
only within science but also outside of
it<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.050> other<00:05:46.230> people<00:05:46.500> as<00:05:46.590> well<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:47.940> sometimes

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
it to other people as well so sometimes

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.280 
it to other people as well so sometimes
at<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.360> coffee<00:05:48.540> break<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.870> can<00:05:48.960> get<00:05:49.080> people

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
at a coffee break you can get people

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.570 
at a coffee break you can get people
talking<00:05:49.380> quite<00:05:49.680> technically<00:05:50.130> about<00:05:50.340> things

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
talking quite technically about things

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.850 
talking quite technically about things
that<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.940> know<00:05:51.060> nothing<00:05:51.570> about<00:05:51.660> but<00:05:52.560> usually

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
that I know nothing about but usually

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.900 
that I know nothing about but usually
the<00:05:52.920> first<00:05:53.040> person<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.370> put<00:05:53.460> my<00:05:53.580> hand<00:05:53.760> up<00:05:53.820> and

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
the first person to put my hand up and

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.130 
the first person to put my hand up and
said<00:05:54.060> don't<00:05:54.240> Williams<00:05:54.510> definitely<00:05:54.930> talking

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
said don't Williams definitely talking

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.290 
said don't Williams definitely talking
about<00:05:55.550> can<00:05:56.550> you<00:05:56.640> explain<00:05:56.850> it<00:05:56.940> in<00:05:57.060> simpler

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
about can you explain it in simpler

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.850 
about can you explain it in simpler
terms<00:05:57.390> because<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.110> think<00:05:58.170> at<00:05:58.500> all<00:05:58.530> different

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
terms because I think at all different

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.040 
terms because I think at all different
levels<00:05:59.010> of<00:05:59.370> science<00:05:59.790> and<00:06:00.660> within<00:06:00.840> different

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
levels of science and within different

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.480 
levels of science and within different
groups<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.530> scientists<00:06:02.100> you're<00:06:02.310> going<00:06:02.430> to

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
groups of scientists you're going to

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.070 
groups of scientists you're going to
have<00:06:02.700> different<00:06:03.000> ways<00:06:03.180> of<00:06:03.420> communicating

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
have different ways of communicating

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.150 
have different ways of communicating
those<00:06:04.230> ideas

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.420 

sure<00:06:09.150> yeah<00:06:09.480> I'm<00:06:09.740> pretty<00:06:10.740> much<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.010> same<00:06:11.160> at

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
sure yeah I'm pretty much the same at

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.190 
sure yeah I'm pretty much the same at
home<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:11.940> am<00:06:11.970> here<00:06:12.300> I'm<00:06:12.450> fairly<00:06:12.630> relaxed

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
home and I am here I'm fairly relaxed

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.430 
home and I am here I'm fairly relaxed
and<00:06:13.320> he's<00:06:13.710> again<00:06:14.000> I'm<00:06:15.000> met<00:06:15.840> my<00:06:15.960> wife<00:06:16.170> about

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
and he's again I'm met my wife about

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.960 
and he's again I'm met my wife about
sort<00:06:16.740> of<00:06:16.770> four<00:06:17.040> or<00:06:17.130> five<00:06:17.250> years<00:06:17.280> ago<00:06:17.730> we<00:06:17.850> were

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
sort of four or five years ago we were

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.720 
sort of four or five years ago we were
married<00:06:18.150> about<00:06:18.300> three<00:06:18.570> years<00:06:18.900> I<00:06:19.110> think<00:06:19.730> we're

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
married about three years I think we're

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.260 
married about three years I think we're
doing<00:06:20.970> up<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.240> house<00:06:21.480> that<00:06:22.020> we<00:06:22.140> bought<00:06:22.380> that<00:06:23.270> we

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
doing up a house that we bought that we

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.820 
doing up a house that we bought that we
bought<00:06:24.480> thinking<00:06:24.810> would<00:06:24.930> be<00:06:25.050> okay<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:25.440> it's

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
bought thinking would be okay and it's

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.860 
bought thinking would be okay and it's
now<00:06:25.980> to<00:06:26.040> net<00:06:26.310> be<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> bit<00:06:27.090> of<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.210> money<00:06:27.390> pit<00:06:27.600> but

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
now to net be a bit of a money pit but

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.410 
now to net be a bit of a money pit but
apart<00:06:28.080> from<00:06:28.110> that<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:29.520> we<00:06:29.610> spent<00:06:30.150> on

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
apart from that and we spent on

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.030 
apart from that and we spent on
socializing<00:06:30.870> we<00:06:31.170> go<00:06:31.320> we've<00:06:31.590> spent<00:06:31.830> a<00:06:31.920> lot<00:06:31.950> of

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
socializing we go we've spent a lot of

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.860 
socializing we go we've spent a lot of
time<00:06:32.100> away<00:06:32.340> come<00:06:32.880> around<00:06:32.970> you<00:06:33.180> know<00:06:33.300> friends

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
time away come around you know friends

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.350 
time away come around you know friends
and<00:06:34.020> family<00:06:34.340> parties<00:06:35.340> I'm<00:06:35.760> not<00:06:35.880> too<00:06:36.090> old<00:06:36.120> to

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
and family parties I'm not too old to

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.050 
and family parties I'm not too old to
party<00:06:36.660> just<00:06:36.840> yet<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.610> then<00:06:38.610> what<00:06:38.700> I<00:06:38.730> have<00:06:38.880> got

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
party just yet and then what I have got

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.550 
party just yet and then what I have got
anything<00:06:39.510> else<00:06:39.810> like<00:06:39.960> that<00:06:40.020> does<00:06:40.200> it<00:06:40.260> I<00:06:40.350> get<00:06:40.500> on

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
anything else like that does it I get on

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.029 
anything else like that does it I get on
one<00:06:40.650> most<00:06:40.800> part<00:06:40.980> go<00:06:41.100> for<00:06:41.250> a<00:06:41.280> ride

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.260 

I'd<00:06:46.039> probably<00:06:46.310> be<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:46.580> hospital<00:06:47.030> porter

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
I'd probably be a hospital porter

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.850 
I'd probably be a hospital porter
because<00:06:47.660> that's<00:06:47.840> what<00:06:47.930> I<00:06:47.990> was<00:06:48.139> doing<00:06:48.500> before<00:06:48.710> I

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
because that's what I was doing before I

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.559 
because that's what I was doing before I
came<00:06:49.069> to<00:06:49.100> university<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.850> was<00:06:50.270> a<00:06:50.330> mature

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
came to university I was a mature

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.320 
came to university I was a mature
student<00:06:50.949> I<00:06:51.949> kind<00:06:52.520> of<00:06:52.580> didn't<00:06:52.850> quite<00:06:53.060> know<00:06:53.210> what

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
student I kind of didn't quite know what

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.510 
student I kind of didn't quite know what
I<00:06:53.360> wanted<00:06:53.569> to<00:06:53.690> do<00:06:53.810> after<00:06:54.110> doing<00:06:54.229> a-levels

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
I wanted to do after doing a-levels

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.559 
I wanted to do after doing a-levels
spend<00:06:55.520> about<00:06:55.669> two<00:06:55.910> years<00:06:56.090> working<00:06:56.330> in<00:06:56.479> a

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
spend about two years working in a

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.200 
spend about two years working in a
hospital<00:06:56.720> as<00:06:57.020> a<00:06:57.080> porter<00:06:57.500> I<00:06:57.979> think<00:06:58.940> if<00:06:59.060> I'd

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
hospital as a porter I think if I'd

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.850 
hospital as a porter I think if I'd
never<00:06:59.389> resour<00:06:59.780> Tom<00:07:00.229> from<00:07:00.440> there<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.590> probably

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
never resour Tom from there I probably

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.360 
never resour Tom from there I probably
still<00:07:01.160> be<00:07:01.190> there<00:07:01.610> but<00:07:02.509> I'd<00:07:03.259> probably<00:07:03.500> a<00:07:04.220> little

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
still be there but I'd probably a little

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.559 
still be there but I'd probably a little
bit<00:07:04.520> more<00:07:04.610> seriously<00:07:04.910> I<00:07:04.970> think<00:07:05.060> I'd<00:07:05.389> probably

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
bit more seriously I think I'd probably

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.540 
bit more seriously I think I'd probably
be<00:07:05.840> doing<00:07:06.530> something<00:07:06.949> involved<00:07:07.460> with

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
be doing something involved with

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.100 
be doing something involved with
motorcycling<00:07:08.150> because<00:07:08.300> it's<00:07:08.660> more<00:07:08.900> of<00:07:09.020> it

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
motorcycling because it's more of it
