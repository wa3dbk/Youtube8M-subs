what makes a great writing sample in

what makes a great writing sample in
three<00:00:31.619> words

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
three words

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.810 
three words
content<00:00:32.910> style<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.989> structure<00:00:34.610> let's<00:00:35.610> look

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
content style and structure let's look

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
content style and structure let's look
at<00:00:35.940> each<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.420> three<00:00:36.480> building<00:00:37.110> blocks

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
at each of these three building blocks

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.660 
at each of these three building blocks
in<00:00:37.710> turn<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:39.390> respect<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> content<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
in turn with respect to content the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
in turn with respect to content the
first<00:00:41.910> consideration<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:42.960> sure<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
first consideration is to make sure that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
first consideration is to make sure that
you're<00:00:43.530> meeting<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.879> length<00:00:45.090> requirements

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you're meeting the length requirements

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.979 
you're meeting the length requirements
so<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> writing<00:00:47.789> sample<00:00:48.210> limit<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.660> 20

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so if the writing sample limit is 20

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.810 
so if the writing sample limit is 20
pages<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> submit<00:00:50.789> a
