Hat both hatches are hinged um also I
guess<00:02:23.720> its<00:02:23.989> main<00:02:24.290> feature<00:02:24.560> you're<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.860> to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
guess its main feature you're going to
go<00:02:25.190> head<00:02:25.520> again<00:02:25.730> um<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.959> replaceable

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
go head again um is the replaceable

doesn't fire in it that looks a little
bit<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:32.440> accurate<00:02:33.440> but<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.610> take<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
bit like accurate but you can take that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.650 
bit like accurate but you can take that
one<00:02:35.090> off<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:36.080> little<00:02:36.980> peck<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.459> um<00:02:37.910> here's

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
middle like in the movies there's

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.690 
middle like in the movies there's
railing<00:03:48.440> at<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.680> top<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.130> its<00:03:49.400> head<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.060> um<00:03:51.700> but

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
railing at the top of its head so um but

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.970 
railing at the top of its head so um but
uh<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.900> don't<00:03:54.230> put<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.769> little

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
uh so I don't put this a little

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.520 
uh so I don't put this a little
interesting<00:03:55.989> um<00:03:57.940> yeah

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
interesting um yeah

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.430 
interesting um yeah
look<00:04:00.920> at<00:04:01.040> me<00:04:01.130> one<00:04:01.340> last<00:04:01.580> look<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.240> him<00:04:02.440> pull

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
look at me one last look at him pull

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.120 
look at me one last look at him pull
together<00:04:07.900> he<00:04:08.900> does<00:04:09.110> stand<00:04:09.410> pretty<00:04:09.709> well<00:04:09.890> I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
together he does stand pretty well I

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.800 
together he does stand pretty well I
guess<00:04:10.580> when<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.240> first<00:04:11.450> take<00:04:11.540> them<00:04:11.690> out<00:04:11.780> of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
guess when you first take them out of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.699 
guess when you first take them out of
the<00:04:11.900> box<00:04:12.080> he's<00:04:12.260> up<00:04:12.410> position<00:04:12.860> kind<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.220> low<00:04:13.340> um

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
the box he's up position kind of low um

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.780 
the box he's up position kind of low um
pre-positioned<00:04:15.709> kind<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.280> low<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.669> have

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
pre-positioned kind of low so you have

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.990 
pre-positioned kind of low so you have
to<00:04:16.910> position<00:04:17.120> him<00:04:17.780> higher<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.350> he<00:04:18.410> looks

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
to position him higher and he looks

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.440 
to position him higher and he looks
better<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.329> way<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.959> stuff<00:04:21.290> so<00:04:22.450> there's

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
better that way and stuff so there's

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.580
