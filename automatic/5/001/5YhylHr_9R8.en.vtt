00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
first test of my new but not really new

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.810 
first test of my new but not really new

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
sound which I just got on eBay

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
sound which I just got on eBay
it<00:00:16.080> came<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.590> dead<00:00:16.800> battery<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:18.330> able

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
it came with a dead battery I was able

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.490 
it came with a dead battery I was able
to<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> battery<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.619> my<00:00:20.449> digital

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
to use the battery from my digital

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.330 
to use the battery from my digital
camcorder<00:00:23.000> sitting<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.150> over<00:00:24.180> there<00:00:25.340> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
camcorder sitting right over there so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.279 
camcorder sitting right over there so
the<00:00:26.789> nice<00:00:26.970> thing<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.240> when<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:27.869> done<00:00:28.019> making

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the nice thing is when I'm done making

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.429 
the nice thing is when I'm done making
this<00:00:28.500> video<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> tape

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
this video I can just take out the tape

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
this video I can just take out the tape
pop<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.650> into<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> just

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
pop it into that one there and just

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
pop it into that one there and just
playback<00:00:34.260> directly<00:00:34.829> into<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.250> PC<00:00:35.790> through

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
playback directly into my PC through

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.470 
playback directly into my PC through
firewire<00:00:37.129> since<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.460> digital<00:00:38.640> II<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.239> read

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
firewire since the digital II will read

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
firewire since the digital II will read
the<00:00:39.690> height<00:00:40.410> analog<00:00:41.100> tape<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> convert<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the height analog tape and convert it to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.160 
the height analog tape and convert it to
digital<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.090> nice

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.650 

this<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.800> quite<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> bit

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
this thing is a little quite a bit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
this thing is a little quite a bit
lighter<00:00:51.660> than<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> digital<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.739> which<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
lighter than the digital one which is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.810 
lighter than the digital one which is
nice

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
nice

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
nice
one<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.079> does<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> flip-out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
one thing is it does not have a flip-out

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.290 
one thing is it does not have a flip-out
LCD<00:00:56.969> only<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> color<00:00:57.899> viewfinder<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
LCD only has a color viewfinder so it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.850 
LCD only has a color viewfinder so it's
a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.629> awkward<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:02.160> video<00:01:02.550> with

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
a little more awkward to do video with

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.660 
a little more awkward to do video with
this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> considered<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> high<00:01:06.299> 8<00:01:06.600> XR

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
this is the considered the high 8 XR

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.260 
this is the considered the high 8 XR
which<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.510> best<00:01:09.750> version<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> Sony's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
which was the best version of Sony's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.590 
which was the best version of Sony's
analogue<00:01:12.270> tape<00:01:12.869> recording<00:01:13.520> with<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:15.450> they

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
analogue tape recording with what they

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
analogue tape recording with what they
claimed<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> 440<00:01:17.040> lines<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
resolution although it in real life it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.830 
resolution although it in real life it's
more<00:01:21.720> limited<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> image<00:01:22.799> sensor<00:01:23.840> which

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
more limited by the image sensor which

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
more limited by the image sensor which
on<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.280> high<00:01:26.520> resolution<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on this one is not as high resolution as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
on this one is not as high resolution as
that<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.130> least<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> viewfinder

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that one but at least in the viewfinder

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.600 
that one but at least in the viewfinder
it<00:01:30.329> looks<00:01:30.509> pretty<00:01:30.810> good

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
it looks pretty good

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.910 
it looks pretty good
actually<00:01:32.610> supposed<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.150> better

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
actually supposed to have better

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.640 
actually supposed to have better
low-light<00:01:34.920> sensitivity<00:01:35.460> than<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
low-light sensitivity than that one the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
low-light sensitivity than that one the
digital<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> rated<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.909> 1<00:01:38.970> Lux<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.780> one

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
digital one is rated for 1 Lux this one

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
digital one is rated for 1 Lux this one
was<00:01:40.140> rated<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.680> zero<00:01:41.009> point<00:01:41.280> seven<00:01:41.729> Lux<00:01:41.939> and

light and there you go it's not one of
those<00:02:00.930> cheesy<00:02:01.350> blueish<00:02:02.299> LED<00:02:03.299> lights<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
those cheesy blueish LED lights at this

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
those cheesy blueish LED lights at this
actual<00:02:04.290> halogen<00:02:05.040> 3<00:02:05.399> watt<00:02:05.579> bulb<00:02:06.110> built<00:02:07.110> into

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
actual halogen 3 watt bulb built into

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.990 
actual halogen 3 watt bulb built into
the<00:02:07.500> camera<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.200> perfect<00:02:10.440> video

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
the camera so I can get perfect video

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.810 
the camera so I can get perfect video
even<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.569> totally<00:02:12.959> dark

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
even when it's totally dark

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.590 
even when it's totally dark
without<00:02:14.820> meaning<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.240> use<00:02:16.010> night<00:02:17.010> shot<00:02:17.600> which

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
without meaning to use night shot which

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.330 
without meaning to use night shot which
is<00:02:18.630> not<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> nice<00:02:19.230> thing<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.680> because<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.130> is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is not a nice thing is because this is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.760

would get all washed out but this is the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980 
would get all washed out but this is the

original night shot which you can

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.400 
original night shot which you can

control the exposure on with the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.810 
control the exposure on with the
thumbwheel<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.070> later<00:02:44.250> ones<00:02:44.550> they<00:02:44.790> just

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
thumbwheel the later ones they just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.610 
thumbwheel the later ones they just
whenever<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> turn<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.080> night<00:02:46.260> shot<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
exposure goes up the maximum so if it's

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.190 
exposure goes up the maximum so if it's
a<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.440> bright<00:02:49.940> scene<00:02:50.940> it'll<00:02:51.570> get<00:02:51.720> all<00:02:51.750> washed

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
a in a bright scene it'll get all washed

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.250 
a in a bright scene it'll get all washed
out<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.040> works<00:02:54.000> even<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.690> bright

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
out with this one works even in bright

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.760 
out with this one works even in bright
scenes<00:02:56.130> as<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.820> see<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.290> even<00:02:58.440> right

victim zooming here this has I don't

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660 
victim zooming here this has I don't
know<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.440> analog<00:03:13.860> zoom<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.460> think

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
know what the analog zoom is I think

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.870 
know what the analog zoom is I think
it's<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:14.910> 18<00:03:15.330> times<00:03:15.600> analog<00:03:16.670> 72<00:03:17.670> times

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
it's like 18 times analog 72 times

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's like 18 times analog 72 times
digital<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.140> use<00:03:19.440> digital<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.100> just

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
digital but don't use digital I just

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.760 
digital but don't use digital I just
leave<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.730> off<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.960> doesn't<00:03:22.440> really<00:03:22.560> make

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
leave it off so that doesn't really make

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.500 
leave it off so that doesn't really make
a<00:03:22.800> difference
