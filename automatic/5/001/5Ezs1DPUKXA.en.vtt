based on research and data there's

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.400 
based on research and data there's
another<00:00:06.240> way<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.600> practicing<00:00:07.170> called

such a person would periodically get to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.710 
such a person would periodically get to

what to do in medicine that's a problem
we've<00:00:23.640> got<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> solution<00:00:24.300> that's<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> topic<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we've got a solution that's the topic of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.690 
see the issue with a review article is
that<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.740> an<00:00:35.010> opinion

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that it's just an opinion

many times on healthcare triage have you

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.830 
many times on healthcare triage have you
been<00:00:49.260> relying<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.830> opinion<00:00:50.340> no<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:51.420> relied

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
been relying on opinion no I've relied
on<00:00:51.920> systematic<00:00:52.920> reviews<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.580> those<00:00:54.150> are

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
on systematic reviews and those are

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
on systematic reviews and those are
different<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> look<00:00:55.200> at<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.410> article<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
research journal you'll see that they

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
research journal you'll see that they
all<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.780> basic<00:00:58.260> structure<00:00:58.739> first<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
all have a basic structure first up is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.640 
all have a basic structure first up is
the<00:00:59.640> background<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> review<00:01:01.200> of<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
the background it's a review of what we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
know about a subject as well as what we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.510 
know about a subject as well as what we
don't<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.290> sets<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> stage<00:01:05.130> for<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
don't know it sets the stage for the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.160 
don't know it sets the stage for the
paper<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.479> read<00:01:06.660> next<00:01:06.960> comes

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
paper you're about to read next comes

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
paper you're about to read next comes
the<00:01:07.229> objective<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.190> short<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> tells

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the objective it's short and it tells

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
the objective it's short and it tells
you<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> study<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:10.020> reading<00:01:10.350> wanted

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you what the study you're reading wanted

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.650 
you what the study you're reading wanted
to<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.340> you've<00:01:11.880> written<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> background

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
to do if you've written the background

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.570 
to do if you've written the background
well<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.229> objective<00:01:13.350> makes<00:01:13.890> total<00:01:14.160> sense

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
well the objective makes total sense

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
well the objective makes total sense
then<00:01:14.729> comes<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.149> methods<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
then comes the methods that's the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
then comes the methods that's the
section<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> explain<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> did

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
section where you explain how you did

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
section where you explain how you did
the<00:01:18.149> study<00:01:18.420> depending<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.530> study<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the study depending on the study in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
the study depending on the study in
question<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.850> simple<00:01:21.300> or<00:01:21.420> complex

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
question this can be simple or complex

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
question this can be simple or complex
but<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> key<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> has<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.490> be

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
but the key is that it has to be

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
but the key is that it has to be
transparent<00:01:24.119> enough<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.660> someone<00:01:24.930> could

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
transparent enough that someone could

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
transparent enough that someone could
replicate<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.979> study<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.940> good

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
replicate your study because good

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
replicate your study because good
science<00:01:27.690> is<00:01:27.899> science<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.560> been<00:01:28.740> tried

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
science is science that's been tried

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
science is science that's been tried
repeatedly<00:01:29.430> next<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.330> results<00:01:30.810> that's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
repeatedly next are the results that's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.660 
repeatedly next are the results that's
where<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> talk<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.460> found

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
where you talk about what you found

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.610 
where you talk about what you found
usually<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> table<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
usually there's a table one that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.350 
usually there's a table one that
describes<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> group<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> looked<00:01:35.760> at<00:01:35.970> using

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
describes the group you looked at using

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
describes the group you looked at using
your<00:01:36.479> methods<00:01:36.870> there's<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.320> usually<00:01:37.680> other

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
