00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
to ship in a giant crate because it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.500 
to ship in a giant crate because it
becomes<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.020> heavy<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.410> technical<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.880> he

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
becomes so heavy and technical that he

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.570 
becomes so heavy and technical that he
has<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.900> ship<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.170> in<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> crate<00:03:51.530> as<00:03:51.770> opposed<00:03:52.370> in

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
has to ship it in a crate as opposed in

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.330 
has to ship it in a crate as opposed in
the<00:03:52.670> 70s<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.840> was<00:03:54.020> kind<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.320> corny<00:03:54.650> then<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.280> he

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
the 70s it was kind of corny then but he

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.780 
the 70s it was kind of corny then but he
fit<00:03:55.520> in<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:56.030> briefcase<00:03:57.220> honestly<00:03:58.220> briefcase

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
fit in a briefcase honestly briefcase

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.390 
fit in a briefcase honestly briefcase
sound<00:03:59.090> easier<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.380> idea<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.770> technology<00:04:01.220> is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
sound easier the idea of technology is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.890 
sound easier the idea of technology is
getting<00:04:01.580> smaller<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.090> smaller<00:04:02.150> not<00:04:02.870> bigger

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
getting smaller and smaller not bigger

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.110 
getting smaller and smaller not bigger
and<00:04:03.290> bigger<00:04:03.470> larger<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.519> more<00:04:04.580> complicated

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and bigger larger and more complicated

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.990 
and bigger larger and more complicated
so<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.260> idea<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.590> extremity<00:04:07.100> makes<00:04:07.700> sense

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
so the idea of the extremity makes sense

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.699 
so the idea of the extremity makes sense
and<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.360> idea<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.720> he's<00:04:09.019> essentially<00:04:09.500> become

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
and the idea is he's essentially become

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.860 
and the idea is he's essentially become
a<00:04:09.739> super<00:04:10.130> computer<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.549> they're<00:04:11.209> using<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.690> to

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
a super computer and they're using it to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.469 
a super computer and they're using it to
their<00:04:12.019> advantage<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.850> current<00:04:16.850> series<00:04:17.209> um

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
their advantage in the current series um

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.390 
their advantage in the current series um
at<00:04:18.410> least<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.130> sense<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:21.130> like<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.370> idea

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
at least in the sense of like the idea

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.370 
at least in the sense of like the idea
that<00:04:22.790> he<00:04:23.090> is<00:04:23.120> super<00:04:23.419> computer<00:04:23.750> nan<00:04:23.960> he<00:04:24.080> dumps

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that he is super computer nan he dumps

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.800 
that he is super computer nan he dumps
his<00:04:24.470> memory<00:04:24.890> Tony's<00:04:25.669> currently<00:04:26.150> brain<00:04:26.570> dead

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
his memory Tony's currently brain dead

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.020 
his memory Tony's currently brain dead
in<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.080> way<00:04:27.229> he's<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.380> vegetable<00:04:27.820> trapped<00:04:28.820> in<00:04:28.970> his

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
in a way he's a vegetable trapped in his

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.560 
in a way he's a vegetable trapped in his
own<00:04:29.150> mind<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.680> he<00:04:31.190> could<00:04:31.850> do<00:04:31.940> sorts<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.419> things

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
own mind and he could do sorts of things

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.630 
own mind and he could do sorts of things
too<00:04:32.930> he<00:04:33.229> can<00:04:33.380> talk<00:04:33.680> two<00:04:33.860> phones<00:04:34.130> hack<00:04:34.460> and

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
too he can talk two phones hack and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.450 
too he can talk two phones hack and
Peter<00:04:34.820> in<00:04:34.940> his<00:04:35.090> mind<00:04:35.450> he<00:04:36.440> has<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> magnetism

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
Peter in his mind he has a magnetism

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.920 
Peter in his mind he has a magnetism
ability<00:04:37.910> and<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.060> know<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.240> was<00:04:38.419> before<00:04:38.660> against

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
ability and I know I was before against

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.770 
ability and I know I was before against
this<00:04:39.080> because<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.440> gives<00:04:39.560> him<00:04:39.680> super<00:04:40.010> powers<00:04:40.370> I

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
this because it gives him super powers I

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.810 
this because it gives him super powers I
consider<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.900> more<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.440> he<00:04:42.740> has<00:04:42.979> like<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.400> huge

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
consider it more that he has like a huge

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.230 
consider it more that he has like a huge
the<00:04:44.479> suit<00:04:45.130> gives<00:04:46.130> him<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.400> super<00:04:46.820> abilities

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
the suit gives him the super abilities

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.030 
the suit gives him the super abilities
so<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:47.510> in<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.260> basically<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.770> student

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
so I in the it's basically was a student

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.320 
so I in the it's basically was a student
body<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.490> I'm<00:04:49.550> consider<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.000> he<00:04:50.210> has

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
body so I'm consider that he has

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.310 
body so I'm consider that he has
physical<00:04:50.840> superpowers<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:53.090> me<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.930> you

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
physical superpowers that's me and you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.050 
physical superpowers that's me and you

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
he has super powers but I don't care

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.159 
he has super powers but I don't care
people<00:04:58.760> call<00:04:58.880> him<00:04:58.910> moron<00:04:59.210> as<00:04:59.479> this
