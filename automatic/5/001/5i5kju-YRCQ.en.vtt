00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.889
 and also practical and institute technician 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.150
 industrial technician of the salon ici e of 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.059
 vicenza 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.460
 we talk in this lesson of the sector 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.619
 recent swana dial that is one 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.950
 tool used for checking 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.190
 of the errors of form of a third party that 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.030
 to also carry out comparative measures 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.090
 that is the difference between a piece between the 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.539
 dimensions of a piece and those of I think 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 between them as a reference then those 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:42.920
 with samples price 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.530
 it is the grandmother 4.180 of 1970 that establishes 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.739
 the functional characteristics and the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:55.129
 missionaries with camp lasts up to 10 ma 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:00.100
 also establishes the characteristics of 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.100
 quality and living conditions 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.369
 the howard centesimal comparator is a 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.369
 30 of comparison measures we have read 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.770
 with the movements of an auction are 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.700
 amplified and three months to an index that 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.640
 empty in front of a circular dial 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.590
 graduated as we see in the image 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.780
 we also see in the images and parts 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.640
 fundamentals of the regiment as we see 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.700
 in this next video the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 comparator must have in addition to the index 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.819
 a totalizer device and that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.860
 indicate the number of udine three i 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.189
 testator routes from the auction 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.140
 vertical or raw taxer and here is the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.619
 small dial I can inside the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.229
 main deck and what we see is in front 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.040
 to which rotates a small in fallen with 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.409
 indicator to the recipe a graduation 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.990
 of the main quadrant indeed as yes 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.280
 sees is the division center 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.519
 both the 360-degree dino angle is divided 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.489
 in 100 hawks whose every millimeter of 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.040
 vertical shift of the ego of the for 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.459
 please determine a complete turn of the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.350
 judge or indicator with a needle with 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.350
 leogrande to be clear we use 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.310
 as the name suggests, the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.260
 buyer feel bad at the dial is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.260
 an instrument whose approximation 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:44.830
 sliding given by a millimeter 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.230
 corresponding to their ride that is 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.269
 therefore divided 100 parts have 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.500
 division detaches it from the dial 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.500
 corresponds to a penny 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.799
 let's look at the use of the 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.950
 tool for making measurements 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.500
 comparative of some pieces in the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.609
 images that run silene that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.950
 we doubt that the parallel plans 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.739
 as a reference sample then 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.400
 we check with the caliber the share of 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:26.859
 one of the pieces to check and with two 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 blocks we have a height of 28 mm 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:33.349
 on which we adhere the comparator 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.829
 we will verify the movement of 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:40.310
 hundredths of a millimeter of the measurement of 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:44.269
 pieces compared to this sample 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.799
 reference as you can see is appropriate 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.700
 the support tool in ashes 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:53.829
 universal with table and attachment 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.829
 appropriate for the comparator itself 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.780
 to check the repeatability of the 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.420
 tool only we then leave more 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.209
 your lifting times e 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.340
 of the mobile auction we know that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:23.419
 the index pointer turns the opposition 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:27.349
 always on the 0 then trantino that you are 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:31.870
 you can check the prices you can 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:36.139
 note the deviation 21 cents e 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:41.440
 wet compared to the certain altitude of 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:46.400
 reference and this is the use of 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:05:01.420
 comparator we say more widespread and more than 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:05:08.160
 a fountain we visit 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:11.980
 divided by the comparator for checking 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.870
 in this case control of 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.300
 flatness of a surface of a 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.520
 parallelepiped obtained for 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:26.200
 the operation of artist joe and resets 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.620
 the moment in point of the surface e 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.180
 sliding price hearts up to 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.770
 inclined table the support can be 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:43.200
 check the displacements of the points 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:48.220
 of the surface that I go to say 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:53.980
 test and all of course with the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:57.820
 precision centime the comparator mi 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.740
 gives the idea of ​​the progress of the 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.180
 surface 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.550
 similarly, verification can be performed 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:12.060
 inclinations of cylinder surfaces 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.060
 eccentricity city and so on
