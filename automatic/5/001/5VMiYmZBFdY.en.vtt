00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.020 

now<00:00:23.320> some<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.710> my<00:00:23.830> colleagues<00:00:24.030> incorrectly

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
now some of my colleagues incorrectly

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.600 
now some of my colleagues incorrectly
showed<00:00:25.330> while<00:00:25.570> we<00:00:25.720> were<00:00:25.810> racing<00:00:26.190> it's<00:00:27.190> easier

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
showed while we were racing it's easier

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.769 
showed while we were racing it's easier
to<00:00:27.760> do<00:00:27.880> this<00:00:28.029> if<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:28.300> had<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.600> backhoe

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
to do this if you had the backhoe

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.810 
to do this if you had the backhoe
twisted<00:00:29.410> away<00:00:29.619> from<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.949> tractor<00:00:30.220> slightly

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
twisted away from the tractor slightly

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.850 
twisted away from the tractor slightly
so<00:00:31.330> you<00:00:31.359> could<00:00:31.630> see<00:00:31.840> when<00:00:32.020> these<00:00:32.110> bottom<00:00:32.590> pins

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
so you could see when these bottom pins

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760 
so you could see when these bottom pins
right<00:00:33.070> here<00:00:33.340> rest<00:00:33.640> down<00:00:33.820> into<00:00:34.150> J<00:00:34.449> hooks<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
right here rest down into J hooks the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.830 
right here rest down into J hooks the
backhoe<00:00:36.160> sitting<00:00:36.460> -<00:00:36.610> up<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:36.970> down<00:00:37.030> these

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
backhoe sitting - up and down these

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.420 
backhoe sitting - up and down these
pieces<00:00:38.140> will<00:00:38.440> hit<00:00:38.590> back<00:00:38.769> in<00:00:39.010> here<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.370> you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
pieces will hit back in here and you

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.470 
pieces will hit back in here and you
can't<00:00:39.699> get<00:00:39.790> things<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.149> push<00:00:40.329> together

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
can't get things to push together

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.479 
can't get things to push together
properly<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.350> it's<00:00:41.500> best<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:41.980> let<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.280> sit

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
properly so it's best if you let it sit

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.370 
properly so it's best if you let it sit
curved<00:00:43.120> back<00:00:43.390> away<00:00:43.690> from<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.989> tractor<00:00:44.350> a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
curved back away from the tractor a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:54.229 
curved back away from the tractor a
little<00:00:44.620> bit

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.970 

you<00:00:55.239> can't<00:00:55.510> do<00:00:55.690> this<00:00:55.899> part<00:00:56.170> wrong<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.649> hoses

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
you can't do this part wrong the hoses

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.849 
you can't do this part wrong the hoses
only<00:00:57.250> fit<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.550> one<00:00:57.700> place

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.800 

once<00:01:04.460> those<00:01:04.699> were<00:01:04.879> all<00:01:05.030> closed<00:01:05.390> we're<00:01:05.689> going

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
once those were all closed we're going

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.359 
once those were all closed we're going
to<00:01:05.869> use<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.259> pieces<00:01:06.470> here<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.950> backhoe

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
to use the pieces here in the backhoe

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.710 
to use the pieces here in the backhoe
between<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> bucket<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.240> outriggers

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
between the bucket and the outriggers

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.719 
between the bucket and the outriggers
the<00:01:09.229> lower<00:01:09.409> these<00:01:09.619> down<00:01:09.920> into<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.280> Jiang<00:01:10.549> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the lower these down into the Jiang and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.550 
the lower these down into the Jiang and
then<00:01:11.149> stand<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.600> backhoe<00:01:11.960> back<00:01:12.140> up<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.470> the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
then stand the backhoe back up in the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:02:18.220 
then stand the backhoe back up in the
back

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.570 

if<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.350> notice<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.830> did<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.100> right<00:02:20.280> hand

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
if you notice when I did the right hand

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.310 
if you notice when I did the right hand
side<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.850> had<00:02:21.150> some<00:02:21.330> trouble<00:02:21.690> sliding<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> pin

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
side I had some trouble sliding the pin

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
side I had some trouble sliding the pin
into<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> hole<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.130> what<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> did<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
into the hole so what I did was the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.540 
into the hole so what I did was the
lower<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.810> outriggers<00:02:25.350> down<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.830> twist<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
lower the outriggers down and twist the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
lower the outriggers down and twist the
backhoe<00:02:26.940> around<00:02:27.240> while<00:02:27.450> pushing<00:02:27.660> pressure<00:02:28.050> on

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
backhoe around while pushing pressure on

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.890 
backhoe around while pushing pressure on
this<00:02:28.380> pin<00:02:28.590> until<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.890> slid<00:02:29.160> into<00:02:29.310> place<00:02:29.900> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
this pin until it slid into place you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.940 
this pin until it slid into place you
should<00:02:31.080> always<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.470> able<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:31.770> these

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
should always be able to get these

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
should always be able to get these
through<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> whole<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.700> never<00:02:33.120> really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
through the whole thing and never really

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120 
through the whole thing and never really
ever<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.960> take<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> hammer<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.740> pound<00:02:34.950> at

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
ever have to take a hammer and pound at

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.740 
ever have to take a hammer and pound at
them<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.030> matter<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.330> jiggling

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
them it's just a matter of jiggling

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.800 
them it's just a matter of jiggling
things<00:02:36.990> until<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.410> slide<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.390> that's<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
things until they slide in so that's it

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.570 
things until they slide in so that's it
that's<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> whole<00:02:40.530> process<00:02:41.010> take<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> loader

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
that's the whole process take a loader

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.360 
that's the whole process take a loader
and<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.790> backhoe<00:02:41.970> law<00:02:42.270> looka<00:02:42.660> go<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> VX<00:02:43.250> hope<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and a backhoe law looka go to VX hope it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.630 
and a backhoe law looka go to VX hope it
goes<00:02:44.490> easier<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.210> next<00:02:45.480> time
