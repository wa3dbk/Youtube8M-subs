00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
thinking that the biggest complaint i

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
thinking that the biggest complaint i
think<00:01:25.920> people<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.369> beyond<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.540> being<00:01:27.780> maybe

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
think people have beyond it being maybe

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
think people have beyond it being maybe
difficulty<00:01:28.710> raw<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
difficulty raw but is that it's so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.990 
difficulty raw but is that it's so
expensive<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.560> i<00:01:32.159> think<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> reason<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
expensive and i think the reason it's so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
expensive and i think the reason it's so
expensive<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:33.810> people<00:01:34.290> don't<00:01:34.530> know

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
expensive is because people don't know

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.819 
expensive is because people don't know
how<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.009> buy<00:01:35.310> food<00:01:35.640> properly<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.320> best<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.770> is

how to buy food properly the best way is

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.560 
how to buy food properly the best way is

things you don't really need are going

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.020

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
out to eat or whatever so I think it's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.570 
out to eat or whatever so I think it's
just<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.269> rearranging<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.200> priorities<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.220> don't

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
just a rearranging of priorities I don't

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.770 
just a rearranging of priorities I don't
really<00:02:43.670> do<00:02:43.940> any<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.209> those<00:02:44.299> things<00:02:44.360> anymore

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
really do any of those things anymore

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.360 
really do any of those things anymore
and<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.110> don't<00:02:45.140> spend<00:02:45.560> money<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:45.860> those<00:02:46.069> things

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and I don't spend money on those things

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.400 
and I don't spend money on those things
so<00:02:46.670> four<00:02:47.330> hundred<00:02:47.600> dollars<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.840> month<00:02:47.930> doesn't

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so four hundred dollars a month doesn't

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
so four hundred dollars a month doesn't
really<00:02:48.739> seem<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.069> all<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> much<00:02:49.940> when
