but I cannot you do not have permission
to<00:03:45.200> open<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.560> store<00:03:45.769> at<00:03:45.859> blah<00:03:46.010> blah<00:03:46.160> okay<00:03:46.579> I

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
to open a store at blah blah okay I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.159 
to open a store at blah blah okay I
don't<00:03:47.480> know<00:03:47.599> how<00:03:47.690> permission<00:03:48.310> now<00:03:49.310> what<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.579> do

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
don't know how permission now what I do

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.259 
don't know how permission now what I do
well<00:03:51.169> this<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> technique<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.910> farm

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
well this is the technique you you farm

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.420 
well this is the technique you you farm
land<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.500> hoe<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:55.069> grass

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
land just like this you hoe the grass

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.210 
land just like this you hoe the grass
that<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.090> dirt<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.450> connected<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.680> it

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
that the dirt is connected to so it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.770 
that the dirt is connected to so it
breaks<00:03:58.940> both<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.959> gate<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.819> come<00:04:02.329> sign

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
breaks both the gate and the come sign

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.020 
breaks both the gate and the come sign
even<00:04:03.650> if<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.859> locked<00:04:04.129> so<00:04:04.400> that's<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.790> very

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
even if it's locked so that's a very

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.550 
even if it's locked so that's a very
good<00:04:05.120> technique<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.660> breaking<00:04:06.379> in<00:04:06.470> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
good technique to breaking in the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.610 
good technique to breaking in the
underground<00:04:06.919> houses<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:08.230> yeah<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.500> if<00:04:09.560> you

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
underground houses and yeah so if you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.809 
underground houses and yeah so if you
just<00:04:09.739> want<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:09.980> break<00:04:10.220> into<00:04:10.459> your<00:04:10.489> friends

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
just want to break into your friends

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.390 
just want to break into your friends
house<00:04:11.000> grief<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.870> for<00:04:12.799> your<00:04:12.919> enemies<00:04:13.160> house

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
house grief it for your enemies house

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
their house and then you scare them and

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.740 
their house and then you scare them and
they<00:05:34.280> run<00:05:34.490> away<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:34.970> they<00:05:35.120> end<00:05:35.270> up<00:05:35.360> falling<00:05:35.570> in

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
they run away and they end up falling in

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.060 
they run away and they end up falling in
love<00:05:35.960> with<00:05:36.080> her<00:05:36.230> listen<00:05:36.620> up<00:05:36.740> this<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:36.920> what<00:05:37.010> you

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
love with her listen up this is what you

do

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.879 

see<00:06:03.069> it<00:06:03.639> works<00:06:03.939> every<00:06:04.419> time<00:06:04.689> most<00:06:05.439> the<00:06:05.529> time<00:06:05.769> we

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
see it works every time most the time we

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.279 
see it works every time most the time we
fall<00:06:06.069> in<00:06:06.189> lava<00:06:06.399> and<00:06:06.959> sometimes<00:06:07.959> they<00:06:08.110> just

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
fall in lava and sometimes they just

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.509 
fall in lava and sometimes they just
land<00:06:08.469> on<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.649> cliff<00:06:08.860> it's<00:06:09.039> better<00:06:09.219> when<00:06:09.429> they

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:09.519 
land on the cliff it's better when they

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:10.739 
land on the cliff it's better when they
win<00:06:09.669> on<00:06:09.699> the<00:06:09.909> cliff<00:06:10.119> because<00:06:10.239> now<00:06:10.479> you<00:06:10.539> can

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749
