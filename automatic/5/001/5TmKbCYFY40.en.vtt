extreme<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.930> me<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.680> an<00:01:55.799> easy

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
extreme but for me it was an easy

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.780 
extreme but for me it was an easy
transition<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:58.430> takes<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.579> bit<00:01:59.729> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
transition and takes a little bit of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
transition and takes a little bit of
work<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.049> overall<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.680> work

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
work but overall it's not that much work

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.530 
work but overall it's not that much work
cuz<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.340> cooking<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.759> foods<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
cuz you're not cooking your foods and I

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.910 
cuz you're not cooking your foods and I
didn't<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.630> alkaline<00:02:07.110> water<00:02:07.290> through<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
didn't do alkaline water through that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
didn't do alkaline water through that
throughout<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.459> process<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
throughout this process I did a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.809 
throughout this process I did a
distilled<00:02:10.080> water<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:11.160> still<00:02:11.370> felt<00:02:11.550> great

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
distilled water and i still felt great

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.340

and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.900 
and
I<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.550> man<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I have to have to give it to the man to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 
I have to have to give it to the man to
Hootie<00:02:18.260> Hootie<00:02:19.260> modera<00:02:19.560> he<00:02:19.980> definitely

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
Hootie Hootie modera he definitely

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.970 
Hootie Hootie modera he definitely
killed<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.850> formula<00:02:21.630> that's<00:02:22.200> why<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
killed it on this formula that's why it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.250 
killed it on this formula that's why it
is<00:02:23.220> claimed<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:23.820> world-famous<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
is claimed as world-famous so this is
