00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.870
 pokemon red version would it be hours 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.580
 back to the past towards our childhood 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350

 the new animated series where the hero does 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.779
 would be more to cham and wadi the character 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 original 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 we notice that the teacher string 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 will be present and that only the 151 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 first pokemon will be known early 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 of the game the teacher will also give 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 a pokedex to the heroes and the latter 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.809
 will choose salameche as pokemon of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.149
 departure 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.770
 we can see green the rival 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.690
 of raids bickering with him 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 visibly they bicker in a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.899
 place still unknown and someone or 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 something attract them to the last 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 moment at the next plane we see 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 stone the champion of the first arena 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.309
 choosing two pokemon maybe this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 who will choose for his match against red 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.879
 then peter master of the pokemon league 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 canto appears under the eyes of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.180
 weight would seem like red to face or 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 will face peter the room looks like 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.240
 strongly to the pokemon league 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.729
 the kit on the left all covers 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 almost the last scene would unfold 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 in the ultimate hall of the pokemon league 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 or red will face green in a match 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 hard we notice the thor tank of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 green which leaves us thinking that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
