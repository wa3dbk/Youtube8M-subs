00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
gonna break this up into a number of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529

let's open our nib file again and
connect<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.840> up<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.190> okay<00:03:49.190> back<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.670> our

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
connect that up like so okay back to our

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
connect that up like so okay back to our
implementation<00:03:50.600> file<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.260> let's<00:03:51.980> go<00:03:52.190> ahead

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
implementation file and let's go ahead

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:15.340 
implementation file and let's go ahead
and<00:03:53.080> do<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.200> work<00:04:12.070> address<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.790> then<00:04:14.600> this<00:04:15.200> is

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
and do the work address and then this is

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:25.629 
and do the work address and then this is
gonna<00:04:15.530> get<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:16.070> resource<00:04:16.910> path<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:19.370> bundles

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.909 

path<00:04:25.939> for<00:04:26.599> resource<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.409> the<00:04:27.530> name<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.710> our

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
path for resource in the name of our

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:36.730 
path for resource in the name of our
file<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.659> read<00:04:30.699> of<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.939> type<00:04:33.789> HTML<00:04:35.740> so

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
file it is read of the type HTML so

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.219 
file it is read of the type HTML so
that's<00:04:36.949> gonna<00:04:37.159> get<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> path<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:38.569> our<00:04:38.780> resource

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
that's gonna get a path to our resource

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.339 
that's gonna get a path to our resource
which<00:04:39.560> in<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:39.860> case<00:04:40.099> is<00:04:40.460> our<00:04:41.150> read<00:04:41.479> HTML<00:04:42.139> file

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
which in this case is our read HTML file

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.249 
which in this case is our read HTML file
over<00:04:42.620> here<00:04:43.539> okay<00:04:44.539> I'm<00:04:44.599> just<00:04:44.750> gonna<00:04:44.840> stick<00:04:45.139> it

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
over here okay I'm just gonna stick it

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.170 
over here okay I'm just gonna stick it
in<00:04:45.349> a<00:04:45.439> string<00:04:45.710> there<00:04:45.979> and<00:04:46.310> then<00:04:46.939> we're<00:04:47.090> gonna

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
in a string there and then we're gonna

00:04:47.180 --> 00:05:10.179 
in a string there and then we're gonna
create<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.599> US<00:05:06.819> we're<00:05:07.819> gonna<00:05:07.969> do<00:05:08.150> file<00:05:08.949> URL<00:05:09.949> with

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:10.189 
create a US we're gonna do file URL with

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:48.850 
create a US we're gonna do file URL with
path<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.840> passing<00:05:11.840> that<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:46.029> created<00:05:47.860> and

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
path and passing that we created and

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.430 
path and passing that we created and
then<00:05:48.979> finally<00:05:49.460> we<00:05:49.819> want<00:05:50.029> to<00:05:50.150> load<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.440> into

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
then finally we want to load that into

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:01.179 
then finally we want to load that into
our<00:05:51.940> web<00:05:52.940> view<00:05:53.860> request<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.750> there<00:06:00.650> we<00:06:00.770> go

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:01.189 
our web view request and there we go

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.219 
our web view request and there we go
so<00:06:01.729> what<00:06:01.969> we've<00:06:02.089> done<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.300> we've<00:06:02.599> created<00:06:02.779> a

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
so what we've done is we've created a

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.189 
so what we've done is we've created a
string<00:06:03.860> that's<00:06:04.729> holding<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> path<00:06:05.449> to<00:06:06.169> our

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
string that's holding the path to our

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.629 
string that's holding the path to our
file<00:06:06.650> named<00:06:07.430> red<00:06:07.729> of<00:06:08.060> type<00:06:08.330> HTML<00:06:09.080> so<00:06:09.919> we<00:06:10.069> have<00:06:10.279> a

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
file named red of type HTML so we have a

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.589 
file named red of type HTML so we have a
string<00:06:12.039> that<00:06:13.039> has<00:06:13.099> the<00:06:13.490> path<00:06:13.669> to<00:06:13.939> our<00:06:14.000> file<00:06:14.240> and

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
string that has the path to our file and

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.240 
string that has the path to our file and
then<00:06:15.319> we<00:06:15.500> pass<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:16.189> string<00:06:16.879> into<00:06:18.250> this

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
then we pass that string into this

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.179 
then we pass that string into this
method<00:06:19.699> file<00:06:19.909> URL<00:06:20.509> with<00:06:20.719> path<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.740> creates

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
method file URL with path that creates

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.589 
method file URL with path that creates
our<00:06:22.400> NS<00:06:22.819> URL<00:06:23.360> and<00:06:23.779> then<00:06:24.469> that<00:06:24.740> nsurl<00:06:25.759> we<00:06:26.330> pass

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
our NS URL and then that nsurl we pass

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.429 
our NS URL and then that nsurl we pass
to<00:06:27.110> request<00:06:27.620> with<00:06:28.159> URL<00:06:28.669> which<00:06:29.599> is<00:06:29.810> creating

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
to request with URL which is creating

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:34.189 
to request with URL which is creating
our<00:06:30.939> nsurl<00:06:31.939> request<00:06:32.389> which<00:06:33.199> then

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
our nsurl request which then

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.850 
our nsurl request which then
gets<00:06:34.919> loaded<00:06:35.219> into<00:06:35.610> our<00:06:35.819> webview<00:06:36.300> okay<00:06:37.199> pretty

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
gets loaded into our webview okay pretty

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.480 
gets loaded into our webview okay pretty
simple

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
simple

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.029 
simple
let's<00:06:39.419> go<00:06:39.539> ahead<00:06:39.719> and<00:06:39.840> run<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:39.990> see<00:06:40.860> if<00:06:40.949> it

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
let's go ahead and run it see if it

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:49.159 
let's go ahead and run it see if it
works<00:06:41.280> okay<00:06:42.800> simulator<00:06:44.930> run<00:06:46.699> and<00:06:47.699> I<00:06:48.419> haven't

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
works okay simulator run and I haven't

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.790 
works okay simulator run and I haven't
forgotten<00:06:49.289> anything<00:06:49.909> we<00:06:50.909> should<00:06:51.150> see<00:06:51.479> our

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.969 

read<00:06:56.419> HTML<00:06:57.419> file<00:06:57.629> once<00:06:58.110> we<00:06:58.259> do<00:06:58.409> without<00:06:58.800> red

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
read HTML file once we do without red

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:05.300 
read HTML file once we do without red
background<00:06:59.189> and<00:07:02.539> get<00:07:03.539> that<00:07:03.719> open<00:07:03.870> there<00:07:04.249> so<00:07:05.249> we

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
background and get that open there so we

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.550 
background and get that open there so we
can<00:07:05.490> see<00:07:05.639> we<00:07:05.759> have<00:07:05.789> our<00:07:05.999> red<00:07:06.180> background<00:07:06.560> and

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
can see we have our red background and

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.360 
can see we have our red background and
we<00:07:07.949> have<00:07:08.189> our<00:07:08.520> header<00:07:09.270> tag<00:07:09.539> says<00:07:10.259> read<00:07:10.529> read

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
we have our header tag says read read

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.429 
we have our header tag says read read
what<00:07:11.909> you<00:07:12.409> okay<00:07:13.580> that<00:07:14.580> was<00:07:14.699> pretty<00:07:14.879> simple

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:15.439 
what you okay that was pretty simple

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:17.990 
what you okay that was pretty simple
again<00:07:16.469> we<00:07:16.740> knew<00:07:16.860> this<00:07:16.979> was<00:07:17.099> gonna<00:07:17.250> be<00:07:17.430> easy<00:07:17.460> but

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
again we knew this was gonna be easy but

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.240 
again we knew this was gonna be easy but
this<00:07:18.389> is<00:07:18.569> going<00:07:18.840> to<00:07:18.930> be<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.199> foundation<00:07:19.349> with

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
this is going to be the foundation with

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.089 
this is going to be the foundation with
which<00:07:20.490> we<00:07:20.729> will<00:07:20.879> build<00:07:21.150> on<00:07:21.360> the<00:07:22.229> next<00:07:22.500> tutorial

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 
which we will build on the next tutorial

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.390 
which we will build on the next tutorial
which<00:07:23.879> is<00:07:24.180> going<00:07:24.629> to<00:07:24.750> add<00:07:25.169> these<00:07:25.680> web<00:07:26.009> views

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
which is going to add these web views

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.439 
which is going to add these web views
depending<00:07:26.639> on<00:07:27.050> what<00:07:28.050> row<00:07:28.680> a<00:07:29.069> user<00:07:29.400> selects<00:07:29.789> in
