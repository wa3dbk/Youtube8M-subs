00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hinges out and then you're able to stand

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
hinges out and then you're able to stand
this<00:01:40.860> thing<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:42.000> bunch<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> different

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this thing up into a bunch of different

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.630 
this thing up into a bunch of different
angles<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.380> you've<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.040> three<00:01:44.520> angles<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
angles so you've got three angles in the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.340 
angles so you've got three angles in the
horizontal<00:01:47.640> or<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> horizontal<00:01:48.540> position<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
horizontal or a horizontal position I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
horizontal or a horizontal position I
should<00:01:49.380> say<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.909> two

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
should say that you can place it in two

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
should say that you can place it in two
but<00:01:51.299> where<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> thing<00:01:51.810> gets<00:01:51.990> even<00:01:52.229> cooler<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
but where this thing gets even cooler is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.870 
but where this thing gets even cooler is
it<00:01:53.100> swivels

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it swivels

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
it swivels
it's<00:01:54.090> called<00:01:54.299> 360<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> reason<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it's called 360 for a reason and that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
it's called 360 for a reason and that
gives<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> three<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:57.149> angles<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
gives you three more angles that you can

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
gives you three more angles that you can
place<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.969> you're<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> vertical

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
place it in when you're in the vertical

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
place it in when you're in the vertical
position<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.829> can't<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
position really can't get it into the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
position really can't get it into the
horizontal<00:02:03.299> angle<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> vertical<00:02:04.619> angle

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
horizontal angle or the vertical angle

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.109 
horizontal angle or the vertical angle
like<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> flop

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like this because it's going to flop

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
like this because it's going to flop
over<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.290> least<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.009> one

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
over but you can at least do that one

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.770 
over but you can at least do that one
like<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.420> then

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
like that and then

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.080 
like that and then
one<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.190> call<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> five

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
one more like that so I call it five

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
one more like that so I call it five
different<00:02:12.660> angles<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.410> six<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.830> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
different angles and really six if you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.930 
different angles and really six if you
go<00:02:14.010> there<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> guess<00:02:14.520> so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
go there I guess so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.160 
go there I guess so
I've<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> bunch<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.690> different<00:02:16.050> positions

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I've got a bunch of different positions

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
I've got a bunch of different positions
that<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.650> place<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.160> into<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.940> then

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that you can place it into and then

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.540 
that you can place it into and then
again<00:02:18.240> swivels<00:02:18.780> back<00:02:18.840> around<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.370> go

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
again swivels back around so you can go

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.449 
again swivels back around so you can go
from<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.030> super<00:02:21.569> steep<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:23.280> more

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
from like super steep like so to more

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.809 
from like super steep like so to more
relaxed<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:25.319> even<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:25.709> relaxed<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.610> even

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
relaxed to even more relaxed to even

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.979 
relaxed to even more relaxed to even
more<00:02:26.970> relaxed<00:02:27.270> that'll<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.840> your

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
more relaxed that'll be like your

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.320 
more relaxed that'll be like your
perfect<00:02:28.500> typing<00:02:28.920> angle<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:29.459> so

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
perfect typing angle right there so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.510 
perfect typing angle right there so
pretty<00:02:30.989> cool<00:02:31.170> when<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:31.500> time<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:32.250> out<00:02:32.370> on

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
pretty cool when it's time to get out on

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.940 
pretty cool when it's time to get out on
the<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:32.819> flip<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.600> thing<00:02:33.840> closes<00:02:34.140> zipper<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the go flip this thing closes zipper it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.979 
the go flip this thing closes zipper it
on<00:02:35.100> up<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.030> you're<00:02:36.150> ready<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.420> go<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.959> not

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
on up and you're ready to go it's not

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.840 
on up and you're ready to go it's not
real<00:02:37.410> thick<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.920> doesn't<00:02:37.950> add<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> lot<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.550> bulk

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
real thick it doesn't add a lot of bulk

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.570 
real thick it doesn't add a lot of bulk
and<00:02:39.560> why<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.770> probably<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.430> said

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and why I would probably have said

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.400 
and why I would probably have said
before<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.120> reviewed<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.600> case<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> don't

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
before I reviewed this case that I don't

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.170 
before I reviewed this case that I don't
think<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.680> would<00:02:43.830> ever<00:02:43.860> use<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> universal<00:02:44.700> case

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
think I would ever use a universal case

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
think I would ever use a universal case
I<00:02:45.810> think<00:02:46.380> that's<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.680> true<00:02:46.860> anymore<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I think that's not true anymore this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.530 
I think that's not true anymore this
thing's<00:02:47.519> pretty<00:02:47.700> cool<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.180> could<00:02:48.239> see

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
thing's pretty cool and I could see

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 
thing's pretty cool and I could see
myself<00:02:48.720> using<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> functionality<00:02:50.550> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
myself using it for the functionality I

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.060 
myself using it for the functionality I
do<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.209> using<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:51.720> iPad<00:02:52.140> actually<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:53.010> of

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
do like using my iPad actually out of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.949 
do like using my iPad actually out of
the<00:02:53.340> case<00:02:53.550> every<00:02:53.880> once<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.209> while<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.630> this

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
the case every once in a while and this

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.270 
the case every once in a while and this
would<00:02:55.170> allow<00:02:55.319> me<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.860> quite<00:02:56.100> easily

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
would allow me to do that quite easily

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.790 
would allow me to do that quite easily
yet<00:02:56.700> still<00:02:57.060> give<00:02:57.390> me<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.080> ability<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.470> prop<00:02:58.769> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
yet still give me the ability to prop it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.699 
yet still give me the ability to prop it
up<00:02:59.069> when<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.370> wanted<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.819> watch<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.120> movie<00:03:00.269> or<00:03:00.709> do

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
up when I wanted to watch a movie or do

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.470 
up when I wanted to watch a movie or do
anything<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.550> definitely<00:03:03.300> if<00:03:03.390> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
anything like that and definitely if I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.059 
anything like that and definitely if I
had<00:03:03.600> kids<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.080> know<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.380> would<00:03:04.560> protect<00:03:04.890> my

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
had kids I know this would protect my

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.190 
had kids I know this would protect my
iPad<00:03:05.459> during<00:03:06.120> transfer<00:03:06.600> because<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.019> nice

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
iPad during transfer because it's nice

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.009 
iPad during transfer because it's nice
and<00:03:07.440> sturdy<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.940> M<00:03:09.120> edge<00:03:09.360> Universal
