00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
but these things sound great here's the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.950 
but these things sound great here's the
neck<00:00:32.790> pickup

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.360 

here's<00:00:39.960> both<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.500> together<00:00:46.190> then<00:00:47.190> here's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
here's both of them together then here's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
here's both of them together then here's
the<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:53.180> beautiful<00:00:54.180> clear<00:00:54.420> sound<00:00:54.750> they

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the back one beautiful clear sound they

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.350 
the back one beautiful clear sound they
still<00:00:55.289> sound<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.710> single<00:00:56.190> coils<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.760> guess

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
still sound like single coils I guess

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.549 
still sound like single coils I guess
what<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.660> doing<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> dummy

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
what they're doing is they have a dummy

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.580 
what they're doing is they have a dummy
coil<00:00:58.949> somehow<00:00:59.480> wired<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.170> reverse

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
coil somehow wired in and in reverse

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
coil somehow wired in and in reverse
phase<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> ground<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.789> Kansas<00:01:03.030> lahum<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
phase with the ground so Kansas lahum I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
phase with the ground so Kansas lahum I
don't<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.650> supposedly<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> signal

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
don't know but supposedly the signal

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.620 
don't know but supposedly the signal
path<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.970> still<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.450> single<00:01:06.750> coil<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:09.420> course

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
path is still just single coil of course

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.040 
path is still just single coil of course
I<00:01:09.720> love<00:01:09.960> them<00:01:10.049> both<00:01:10.200> together
