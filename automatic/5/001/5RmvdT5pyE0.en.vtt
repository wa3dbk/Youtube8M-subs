yet<00:01:11.759> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.149> journey<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.049> striking

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
yet I think journey is really striking

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
yet I think journey is really striking
to<00:01:13.649> look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.640> time<00:01:14.789> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to look at but at the same time it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
to look at but at the same time it's
really<00:01:15.210> technically<00:01:15.899> incredible<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.950> handles

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
really technically incredible it handles

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.279 
really technically incredible it handles
flight<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.899> I<00:01:18.929> find<00:01:19.229> really

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
flight in a way that I find really

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.889 
flight in a way that I find really
satisfying<00:01:20.009> also<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
satisfying also which is not you know is

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.929 
satisfying also which is not you know is

right and quarter I know or just that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.389 
right and quarter I know or just that
feel<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.810> weight<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.080> even<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> take

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399

feel of weight and even when you take
into<00:01:29.549> account<00:01:29.940> some<00:01:30.209> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.539> things<00:01:30.780> you're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
into account some of the things you're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
into account some of the things you're
doing<00:01:31.020> whether<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.740> running<00:01:32.369> away

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
through the mountain or even the few

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.630 
through the mountain or even the few
times<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.709> actually<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.190> little<00:01:38.429> bit

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
times when you actually do a little bit

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
times when you actually do a little bit
of<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:39.209> of<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.539> platforming<00:01:40.319> in<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

happy<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.170> stopped<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.590> like

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
happy because they stopped and like

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.260 
happy because they stopped and like
meditated<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.580> like<00:01:47.700> 30<00:01:47.880> seconds

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
meditated with me for like 30 seconds

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
meditated with me for like 30 seconds
and<00:01:48.330> i<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.659> trophy<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.140> whatever<00:01:49.380> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and i got that trophy or whatever but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139 
and i got that trophy or whatever but
yeah<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.429> end<00:01:50.459> i<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:50.789> i'd<00:01:50.880> had<00:01:51.030> like

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
yeah at the end i think i'd had like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240 
yeah at the end i think i'd had like
three<00:01:51.420> people<00:01:51.720> had<00:01:52.020> interacted<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.649> but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
three people had interacted with but

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
three people had interacted with but
most<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.209> time<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.539> kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:54.840> myself

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
most of the time was kind of by myself

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.809 
most of the time was kind of by myself
so<00:01:55.679> i<00:01:55.709> was<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.009> surprised<00:01:56.459> at<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> end

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
so i was really surprised at the end

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.940 
so i was really surprised at the end
when<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.209> list<00:01:57.629> like<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.739> people

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
when it does list like all the people

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.930 
when it does list like all the people
who<00:01:59.009> played<00:01:59.220> with<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.550> i<00:01:59.640> thought<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.879> a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
who played with which i thought was a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.550 
who played with which i thought was a
really<00:02:00.060> excellent<00:02:00.390> touch<00:02:00.660> fun<00:02:00.869> yeah<00:02:01.019> yeah<00:02:01.140> but

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

of<00:02:19.920> different<00:02:20.160> experiences<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.730> think<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
of different experiences I think if you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.309 
of different experiences I think if you
play<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.450> game<00:02:21.690> by<00:02:21.840> yourself<00:02:21.959> you're

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
play that game by yourself you're

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.740 
play that game by yourself you're
missing<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.459> entire<00:02:23.580> point<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.599> that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
missing the entire point of that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.899 
missing the entire point of that
experience<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.459> uh<00:02:26.670> you

game for i was like and sounds like

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.000 
game for i was like and sounds like
that's<00:02:39.569> pretty<00:02:39.810> big<00:02:39.930> component<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.830> just

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that's pretty big component is that just

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.210 
that's pretty big component is that just
meeting<00:02:41.280> people<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.640> world

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
meeting people in the world

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.950 
meeting people in the world
saying<00:02:42.370> how<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.460> interact<00:02:42.910> helping<00:02:43.870> each

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
saying how you interact helping each

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.210 
saying how you interact helping each
other<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.350> jumping<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.800> floating<00:02:45.160> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
other with the jumping and floating and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.770 
other with the jumping and floating and
everything<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.820> see<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.450> played

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
everything and see I just played

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.200 
everything and see I just played
multiplier<00:02:47.340> better<00:02:48.340> especially<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.120> ending

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
multiplier better especially the ending

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.150 
multiplier better especially the ending
I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:49.930> more<00:02:50.080> powerful<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.980> it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
I think that's more powerful and it's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520 
I think that's more powerful and it's
like<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.550> are<00:02:51.760> two<00:02:52.300> guys<00:02:52.450> slogging<00:02:53.020> up<00:02:53.290> there
