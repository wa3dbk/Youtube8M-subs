a lot of cricketers get wrong it's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.140 
a lot of cricketers get wrong it's
sliding<00:00:18.480> I'll<00:00:19.440> do<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> demo<00:00:19.860> I'll<00:00:20.850> talk<00:00:21.119> through

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
sliding I'll do a demo I'll talk through

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.619 
sliding I'll do a demo I'll talk through
it<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:22.020> we'll<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.500> competition

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.340 

sliding

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
sliding

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
sliding
last<00:00:34.890> things<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.930> one<00:00:36.930> way<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.740> to<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:38.070> here

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
last things first one way is to go here

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.140 
last things first one way is to go here
the<00:00:39.390> Warner<00:00:42.950> groovin<00:00:43.950> sliding<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.640> quicker

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
the Warner groovin sliding is quicker

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.210 
the Warner groovin sliding is quicker
I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> slide<00:00:45.900> should<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> part<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
I think the slide should be a part of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.910 
I think the slide should be a part of
the<00:00:47.370> normal<00:00:47.880> firm<00:00:48.120> routine<00:00:48.630> we're<00:00:49.530> chasing

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the normal firm routine we're chasing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.840 
the normal firm routine we're chasing
after<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.250> ball<00:00:50.600> slide<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:52.710> never<00:00:52.950> know<00:00:53.130> when<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
after a ball slide you never know when a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
after a ball slide you never know when a
batsman<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.360> been<00:00:54.540> lazy<00:00:54.890> all<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.160> been

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
some confusion key things firstly slide

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
some confusion key things firstly slide
along<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> grass<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:03.420> straight<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.229> almost

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
80 miles an hour they slide along the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420 
80 miles an hour they slide along the
snow<00:01:12.690> don't<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.530> injured<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> same<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
snow don't get injured it's the same in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.050 
snow don't get injured it's the same in
sliding<00:01:16.009> secondly<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.400> slide<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.910> your

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
sliding secondly don't slide on your

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690 
sliding secondly don't slide on your
knees<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.810> try<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.500> slide<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
knees like this try and slide on the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
knees like this try and slide on the
side<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.690> so<00:01:21.930> you'll<00:01:22.350> end<00:01:22.440> up<00:01:22.560> sliding<00:01:22.860> from

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
side here so you'll end up sliding from

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.730 
side here so you'll end up sliding from
here<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.940> you'll<00:01:24.030> finish<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
here and then you'll finish up on the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.210 
here and then you'll finish up on the
side<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.160> bum<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:27.650> third<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.070> is
