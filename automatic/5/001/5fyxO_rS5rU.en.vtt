00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.629 
that like pre wiring and stuff for you
know<00:06:34.879> but<00:06:35.120> as<00:06:35.210> you<00:06:35.330> can<00:06:35.419> see<00:06:35.629> I<00:06:35.870> only<00:06:35.900> have<00:06:36.639> one

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
know but as you can see I only have one

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.230 
know but as you can see I only have one
switch<00:06:37.999> here<00:06:38.389> which<00:06:39.550> basically<00:06:40.550> is<00:06:40.669> it's<00:06:41.120> a

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
switch here which basically is it's a

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.079 
switch here which basically is it's a
closed<00:06:41.479> circuit<00:06:41.960> oh<00:06:42.110> thats<00:06:42.979> which<00:06:43.309> does<00:06:43.580> break

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:44.089 
closed circuit oh thats which does break

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:46.239 
closed circuit oh thats which does break
the<00:06:44.210> circuit<00:06:44.569> turn<00:06:44.809> lights<00:06:45.020> on<00:06:45.259> and<00:06:45.349> off<00:06:45.620> right

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.249 
the circuit turn lights on and off right

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:48.040 
the circuit turn lights on and off right
I'll<00:06:46.550> have<00:06:46.610> a<00:06:46.909> switch<00:06:47.300> or<00:06:47.479> anything<00:06:47.839> like<00:06:47.900> that

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
I'll have a switch or anything like that

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.950 
I'll have a switch or anything like that
that<00:06:48.650> can<00:06:48.849> switch<00:06:49.849> be<00:06:50.059> riding<00:06:50.389> in<00:06:50.479> one<00:06:50.659> color

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
that can switch be riding in one color

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.610 
that can switch be riding in one color
another<00:06:51.499> one<00:06:51.710> so<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.999> without<00:06:53.620> rewiring

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
another one so and without rewiring

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.149 
another one so and without rewiring
everything<00:06:55.580> doing<00:06:56.539> all<00:06:56.689> this<00:06:56.900> work<00:06:57.680> of<00:06:57.919> stuff

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
I'm basically I'm going to put the

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.809 
I'm basically I'm going to put the
lights<00:07:00.199> in<00:07:00.439> it<00:07:00.589> and<00:07:01.099> I'm<00:07:01.159> gonna<00:07:01.310> make<00:07:01.460> a<00:07:01.490> little

panel that when he wants to switch the

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:06.309 
panel that when he wants to switch the
colors<00:07:04.339> he's<00:07:05.120> going<00:07:05.479> to<00:07:05.599> switch<00:07:05.900> he's
