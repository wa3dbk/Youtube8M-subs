know why alex is like that okay I beat
I'll<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:13.130> using<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:13.670> one<00:01:18.220> all<00:01:19.220> right

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
I'll be using this one all right

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:30.490 
I'll be using this one all right
just<00:01:21.620> hook<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.890> up<00:01:21.980> already

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.520 

I<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> blinking<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.990> connect

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
I see a blinking right so on connect

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.260 
I see a blinking right so on connect
this<00:01:36.740> one<00:01:36.890> right<00:01:37.040> here<00:01:37.250> because<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:37.850> turns<00:01:38.090> on

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
this one right here because it turns on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:49.060 
this one right here because it turns on
one<00:01:39.020> part<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.560> or<00:01:39.830> lights<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.760> bottle<00:01:42.400> so<00:01:48.070> it's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
one part on or lights on bottle so it's

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
one part on or lights on bottle so it's
just<00:01:49.310> well<00:01:49.910> he's<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> meter<00:01:50.690> on<00:01:51.850> like<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.940> can

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
just well he's a meter on like you can

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.800 
just well he's a meter on like you can
see<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.420> meter<00:01:53.720> yeah<00:01:54.730> at<00:01:55.730> zero<00:01:56.150> then<00:01:56.630> you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
see that meter yeah at zero then you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.020 
see that meter yeah at zero then you
connect<00:01:57.230> which<00:01:58.100> wire<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.520> what<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:01.670> can<00:02:01.850> get

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
connect which wire is what you can get

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:12.309 
connect which wire is what you can get
any<00:02:02.150> power

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.130 

so<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.159> negative<00:02:13.400> number<00:02:13.969> so<00:02:16.659> power<00:02:17.659> is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
so you get a negative number so power is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.490 
so you get a negative number so power is
the<00:02:18.859> what<00:02:19.069> green<00:02:19.579> ball<00:02:19.760> green<00:02:20.030> wire<00:02:20.510> I'll<00:02:21.319> be

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the what green ball green wire I'll be

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.759 
the what green ball green wire I'll be
using<00:02:21.829> a<00:02:21.950> post<00:02:22.340> with<00:02:22.549> post-op<00:02:23.769> style

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
using a post with post-op style

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:34.110 
using a post with post-op style
connector<00:02:31.959> really<00:02:32.959> easy<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.319> use

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
connector really easy to use

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:47.979

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
yellow and orange I'll be putting some

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.860 
yellow and orange I'll be putting some
researchers<00:04:43.490> on<00:04:43.669> but<00:04:43.909> I<00:04:43.940> gotta<00:04:44.360> buy<00:04:44.570> more<00:04:44.840> of

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
researchers on but I gotta buy more of

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.020 
researchers on but I gotta buy more of
these<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:46.010> I'll<00:04:46.099> show<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.400> how<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.639> do<00:04:46.880> it

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
then they have to right now

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.589 
then they have to right now
so<00:04:51.860> let<00:04:52.070> me<00:04:52.099> turn<00:04:52.340> off<00:04:52.400> those<00:04:52.699> headless<00:04:53.330> lights

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
so let me turn off those headless lights

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:06.850 
so let me turn off those headless lights
on<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:03.139> you<00:05:03.229> can<00:05:03.380> see<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> difference<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:06.740> can

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
on so you can see the difference you can

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.920 
on so you can see the difference you can
buy<00:05:06.979> for<00:05:07.490> balls<00:05:07.759> or<00:05:08.120> just<00:05:08.300> get<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.539> two<00:05:08.720> to

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
buy for balls or just get the two to

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.129 
buy for balls or just get the two to
make<00:05:08.960> look<00:05:09.470> kind<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.770> cool<00:05:10.009> and<00:05:10.810> now<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.960> stays

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
make look kind of cool and now it stays

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.230 
make look kind of cool and now it stays
white<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:14.870> basically<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:16.669> take<00:05:16.940> out<00:05:17.120> this

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
white so basically you take out this

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.260 
white so basically you take out this
wire<00:05:17.539> right<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:18.169> connector<00:05:18.650> from<00:05:18.919> the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
wire right this connector from the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.689 
wire right this connector from the
parking<00:05:20.270> light<00:05:20.389> on<00:05:20.620> with<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.650> green<00:05:21.979> if<00:05:22.610> you

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699

parking light on with a green if you
don't<00:05:22.909> want<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.090> do<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.270> all<00:05:23.720> that<00:05:23.840> testing
