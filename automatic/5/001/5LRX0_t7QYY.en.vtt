00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.390
 hello everyone knows are you gamer and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.700
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.980
 so this new video sets up 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.270
 a new series that is going to be the fashion 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.820
 of the week 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.259
 every week i will introduce you to the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.540
 new game mode that comes out on call of 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.210
 black duty ops 2 on pc i believe when 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.520
 I do not think it exists on ps3 and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.410
 on xbox so we are a little 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.329
 favored pc players for once 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 on call of duty 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 so this game mode is called the fight 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.850
 urban 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.989
 so these two teams who are fighting each other 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.879
 in strategic points 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.670
 no series points the corner 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.679
 to miss in 500 health increase is 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 This game mode is from 3 to 9 and 9 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.249
 you gain touch every second the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.550
 number of points that corresponds to the 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.199
 number of allies in the point so I 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.830
 know it's not very clear but air or 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 look at you look at map 2 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.630
 will understand quickly enough 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.520
 so here is the kids gameplay 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 is not really exceptional from that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.390
 the goal is not to show you a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.920
 beautiful gameplay but no longer do you 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.540
 discover the new game modes 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.300
 every week 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.250
 so that's why I'm going to do some 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.940
 strengths and weaknesses of this 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.340
 game mode so I do not have this video 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.530
 the week 'hard on the previous but 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.480
 that was the word that hellish hardcore fit 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.160
 it was nine to nine on 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.170
 small maps of call of duty 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.450
 gold in 9.9 so here we start with the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.770
 strengths first of all it's some 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.870
 something that entertains every week 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.240
 to have a new game mode that 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.860
 differs from others so there for example 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.540
 the big news is health 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.530
 increases and it takes a lot of bullets 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.920
 to smoke 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.140
 even if I'm going to die a 9-0 and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.770
 humor very quickly so I find 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.700
 that's one more of the consequences had 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.090
 increased and that there is less pomegranate 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:14.260
 and less centex like c4 ds4 are 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.400
 almost nonexistent is however there is 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.920
 even when the grenades 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.510
 syntec cd64 however do you do 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.910
 almost nothing you have very little 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 chances to die the first time on 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.230
 so that's one of the highlights 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.030
 I also find the look hop I 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.360
 dies really quickly on stage 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.709
 trad 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.260
 I know I was in blood to spend 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.930
 pretty fast so now here are the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.920
 weak points is that there is no longer any 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.260
 sniper no one 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.380
 because it becomes easy helpful that you 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.270
 do that dewald that marker hits 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.430
 in addition there is a lot of schengen 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.160
 seen that his tears that will be beneficial to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.590
 melee in the points 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.590
 strategic of a tendency to have 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.790
 a lot of assistance because you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.870
 put a lot more ride so was 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.180
 there is a lot more chance that 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.940
 analyze well the executioners za finished 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950
 the quine and in spain and the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.989
 parts may be too short as 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.730
 a bit too long at 15 minutes is 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.390
 very long they can be opposing 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.130
 three minutes 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.739
 a party can be completed what is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.530
 enough damage so here is this video is 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.299
 finished if you liked come see my 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.650
