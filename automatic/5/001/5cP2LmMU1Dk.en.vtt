00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 paintball against zombies the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 game stores that gradually close the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 call of duty elite version 2.0 free 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.670
 for players and of course the actus ine 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.570
 you are of course jtc tekken and there i 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.219
 stop me right now ask you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.170
 what is it then in fact 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.340
 I explain to you quickly I was 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.449
 unfortunately obliged of you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 present like this the jt 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.660
 exceptionally today since 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.000
 in fact you know my computer 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 notebook is under repair and the sound 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.699
 with my iphone when I film it's 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.199
 really too bad so what 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.240
 I'm trying to do in fact by a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.859
 parasite is trying to improve and not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 lower it to lens I really prefer 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.149
 do you like this the beginning that after 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 the rest of the day will be the same with a mini 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.510
 bad news in the end I you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.559
 will leave the discovery at the end of the day 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 I still wish you a good 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 jt good video because of paintball against 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 zombies the idea very good and he 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.600
 had to see it then the principle is 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.010
 very simple you take a philippe 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.390
 paintball you go in the forest 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 confront actors disguised as 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.949
 zombies that everything is happening in canada in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 a forest of more than 20 hectares so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 of course everything happens during 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 the night if we would not be funny 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.539
 so especially the creator of this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.189
 pretty strange attraction I think is in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.600
 this rather rich moment since the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.760
 paintball sessions are already full 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.890
 until 2013 so if you wish 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.090
 really participate in this small 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.650
 paintball session that has to be pretty 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.240
 nice and well I advise you soon 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.409
 now to register and then bah 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 after anyway on the trip 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.750
 to canada 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.009
 it's a bit chéro but I think 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 that it's really worth it and I'll 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.150
 lets watch a small part of the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.150
 video 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.170
 no it's bob 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.229
 the world 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
 how much 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.920
 indeed, big rumors affect the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.019
 game store since one would have a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.849
 Closure of 35 shops 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.620
 France and therefore 80 deletions 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.870
 jobs but the question we ask ourselves 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.250
 all his crates that will become really 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.459
 this kind of store since look 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.140
 virtua ultimate game and why not 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.909
 soon micromania I do not know it's 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.799
 really just closing 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.760
 so where are we going I have 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.769
 really feel like we're going in 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.799
 download and unemployment in addition 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.840
 Sadly 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.340
 claude uses version 2.0 will be fine 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 free so it's a very very good 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.909
 news 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.889
 unfortunately for the players wii the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.810
 call of duty elite version 2.0 will only 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.409
 not present at the release of black ops 2 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.849
 on wii u 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.439
 we will have to wait a little while 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.639
 because it has not been put in yet 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.209
 place but I think you should 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.459
 to receive 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.560
 shortly after the release I hope 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 in any case for you also 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.859
 the card packs you inevitably ask 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.909
 surely questions about it and the 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.379
 card packs it will come back all 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.760
 just like before he'll have to 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.829
 download the card pack as soon as it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.010
 will be released at least there will be more than 2 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.209
 how to say exclusivity versus 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.560
 to premium players etc 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.730
 and that's so much better because 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.139
 it's with for example for the end of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.849
 1.3 it was a little bit big 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.970
 anything since for the players 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.190
 xbox he had the assault card pack 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.449
 final maybe I do not know in a few 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.190
 month you have it umino for example for 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.329
 ps3 players well we got it at simon 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.459
 two months after you so that's 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.569
 anything we really had at the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.680
 end of modern warfare 3 it's really 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.220
 become anything their models 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.930
 go into a trance 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.909
 that's what I always say it was 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.019
 the crap from the beginning until the end of my 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.979
 the end i would say same site and even a 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.540
 little bit worse unfortunately the news 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.549
 ciné will not be present on my gîte 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.989
 and alan I got a lot of copyright 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.879
 compared to the trailers required 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.690
 that it happens and it happened when I 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.220
 am going to do what I 'm going to try to 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.419
 replace this movie news for the moment 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.109
 I have not found yet in what I 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.030
 go to school I want 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.889
 just swing a little one clip 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.329
 is said that was done by one of 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.220
 my capes team members then it's me 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.109
 who realize it but he published 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.609
 it's called almost 1 I think you 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.349
 may have already heard in 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.639
 the same video his channel and in the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.959
 description also soul go there to make a 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.400
 little trick it would be cool for him to do 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.290
 small montages that are nice enough 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.299
 and I let you discover this guy 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.440
 is said and then me 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.970
 very soon I hope that 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.349
 the utility will have pleased you even if there has been 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.000
 a lot of changes I apologize 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.830
 again but unfortunately I was 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.150
 obliged in relation to copyright and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.229
 then also compared to my pc which 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.879
 is not repaired yet and I hope 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.389
 really they'll be coming I have one 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.389
 a little tired 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.010

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.010
