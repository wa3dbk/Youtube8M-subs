match I thought it was a very good game
the<00:00:22.380> advantage<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> fact<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.900> on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the advantage is with the fact that on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950 
the advantage is with the fact that on
Terra's<00:00:25.380> play<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> second<00:00:26.039> game<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.960> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
Terra's play in the second game and the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
Terra's play in the second game and the
advantage<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> fatigue<00:00:29.699> but

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
advantage on that is not the fatigue but

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
advantage on that is not the fatigue but
more<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.199> nervousness<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
more so that the nervousness of all the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.480 
performance but what were your thoughts
on<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.880> game<00:01:33.119> well<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.009> hot<00:01:35.250> but

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on that game well I think it is hot but

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
on that game well I think it is hot but
i<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> qualifying

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
i think that when we go to qualifying

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
i think that when we go to qualifying
and<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> Central<00:01:37.979> America<00:01:38.460> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and we go in the Central America it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
and we go in the Central America it's
going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> same<00:01:39.540> situation<00:01:40.200> more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
going to be the same situation more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.719 
going to be the same situation more

we're<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.440> defending<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.490> just

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
we're not just defending and then just

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310 
we're not just defending and then just
defending<00:03:09.060> defending<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.540> anywhere<00:03:09.870> we're

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
defending defending if anywhere we're

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.780 
defending defending if anywhere we're
just<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.590> attacking<00:03:10.890> player<00:03:11.100> where<00:03:11.490> we<00:03:11.580> don't

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
just an attacking player where we don't

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.100 
just an attacking player where we don't
do<00:03:11.910> anything<00:03:12.090> when<00:03:12.330> we<00:03:12.420> don't<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> ball

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
do anything when we don't have the ball

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.930 
do anything when we don't have the ball
so<00:03:13.620> those<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> things<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.580> look<00:03:14.730> down<00:03:14.910> on

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so those are the things I look down on

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.300 
so those are the things I look down on
the<00:03:15.150> first<00:03:15.330> day<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.780> second<00:03:16.230> day<00:03:16.290> now<00:03:16.620> comes

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the first day the second day now comes

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.350 
the first day the second day now comes
that<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:17.610> you've<00:03:17.730> captured<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.270> attention

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
that if you've captured the attention

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.810 
that if you've captured the attention
can<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.470> be<00:03:19.590> consistent<00:03:20.190> about<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.580> and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
can you be consistent about it and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.280 
can you be consistent about it and
that's<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.090> we're<00:03:21.630> looking<00:03:21.900> at<00:03:21.990> for<00:03:22.200> those

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that's what we're looking at for those

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.230 
that's what we're looking at for those
players<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:23.190> players<00:03:23.490> were<00:03:23.700> nervous<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
players but players were nervous the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.270 
players but players were nervous the
first<00:03:24.270> day<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:25.110> good<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.890> second

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
first day it's good to have the second

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.700 
first day it's good to have the second
chance<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.640> capture<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.090> attention<00:03:27.150> again

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
chance to capture the attention again

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.500 
chance to capture the attention again
perhaps<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:29.070> nerves<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.940> was<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> first<00:03:30.330> time

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
perhaps the nerves it was the first time

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.790 
perhaps the nerves it was the first time
you<00:03:30.570> might<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.900> been<00:03:30.990> playing<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.530> just

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
you might have been playing it just

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.360 
you might have been playing it just
could<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.270> overall

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
could be just the the overall

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.040 
could be just the the overall
competitions<00:03:35.370> overwhelming<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:37.020> you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
competitions overwhelming so can you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.480 
competitions overwhelming so can you
capture<00:03:37.260> attention<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> second<00:03:38.250> day<00:03:38.280> so

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
capture attention on the second day so

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.980 
capture attention on the second day so
we<00:03:38.910> still<00:03:39.090> keep<00:03:39.270> reviewing<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.690> players<00:03:39.900> that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
we still keep reviewing the players that

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.570 
we still keep reviewing the players that
might<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.440> have<00:03:40.620> done<00:03:40.800> well<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> first<00:03:41.430> day

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
might not have done well the first day

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.990 
might not have done well the first day
so<00:03:42.060> we<00:03:42.150> continue<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:42.900> don't<00:03:43.110> lose<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.410> on

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
so we continue on so we don't lose it on

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.520 
so we continue on so we don't lose it on
Friday<00:03:45.000> when<00:03:45.390> we<00:03:45.480> come<00:03:45.690> back<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.440> going

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
Friday when we come back now it's going

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.810 
Friday when we come back now it's going
to<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.710> situation<00:03:46.950> we're<00:03:47.400> starting<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.760> see

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
