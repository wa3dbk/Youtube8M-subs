advances<00:01:48.170> are<00:01:48.409> of<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.920> more<00:01:49.189> cute<00:01:49.729> or<00:01:49.969> an

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
advances are of a more cute or an

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.239 
advances are of a more cute or an
adorable<00:01:50.600> way<00:01:50.749> like<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:51.350> if<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.530> little<00:01:51.799> kid<00:01:51.829> was

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
adorable way like as if a little kid was

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.980 
adorable way like as if a little kid was
hitting<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.639> them<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.060> he<00:01:53.270> also<00:01:53.420> tends<00:01:53.869> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
hitting on them and he also tends to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.739 
hitting on them and he also tends to
call<00:01:54.259> women<00:01:54.530> mama<00:01:55.039> so<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:56.149> kind<00:01:56.389> of<00:01:56.450> speaks

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
call women mama so that kind of speaks

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.399 
call women mama so that kind of speaks
for<00:01:56.959> itself

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
for itself

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.709 
for itself
now<00:01:57.709> as<00:01:57.889> I<00:01:58.009> said<00:01:58.219> before<00:01:58.399> often<00:01:59.090> times<00:01:59.329> women

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
now as I said before often times women

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.599 
now as I said before often times women
would<00:01:59.899> just<00:01:59.929> beat<00:02:00.409> up<00:02:00.590> Johnny<00:02:00.920> Bravo<00:02:01.399> for

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
would just beat up Johnny Bravo for

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.519 
would just beat up Johnny Bravo for
hitting<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:01.969> them<00:02:02.179> now<00:02:02.569> most<00:02:02.959> women<00:02:03.079> wouldn't

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
hitting on them now most women wouldn't

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.620 
hitting on them now most women wouldn't
beat<00:02:03.859> up<00:02:04.100> an<00:02:04.340> eight-year-old<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.299> kind

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
beat up an eight-year-old and this kind

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.629 
beat up an eight-year-old and this kind
of<00:02:05.719> makes<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.229> theory<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.679> little<00:02:07.009> bit<00:02:07.159> iffy

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
of makes the theory a little bit iffy

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.609 
of makes the theory a little bit iffy
but<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.060> couple<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.539> explanations<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.350> this

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
but a couple of explanations for this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.190 
but a couple of explanations for this
were<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.100> maybe<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.090> his<00:02:11.480> head<00:02:11.750> he's<00:02:11.989> not

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
were one maybe in his head he's not

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.589 
were one maybe in his head he's not
really<00:02:12.470> annoying<00:02:12.950> them<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.879> them<00:02:14.090> he's

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
really annoying them but to them he's

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.190 
really annoying them but to them he's
been<00:02:14.840> pestering<00:02:15.080> them<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> very<00:02:15.830> long

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
been pestering them a very long

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.630 
been pestering them a very long
time<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.739> give<00:02:16.920> him<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.069> little<00:02:17.220> smack<00:02:17.610> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
time so they give him a little smack on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
time so they give him a little smack on
the<00:02:17.849> wrist<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.330> smack<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.810> face<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.440> then

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the wrist or smack on the face and then

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.130 
the wrist or smack on the face and then
in<00:02:19.770> his<00:02:20.040> head<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:20.700> exaggerated<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.810> much

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
in his head he exaggerated that much

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900 
in his head he exaggerated that much
like<00:02:22.349> he<00:02:22.500> does<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.709> his<00:02:22.920> personality<00:02:23.519> and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
like he does with his personality and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.509 
like he does with his personality and
his<00:02:23.970> figure<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.140> extreme<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.280> his

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
his figure to the extreme and in his

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.369 
his figure to the extreme and in his
head<00:02:26.760> they're<00:02:27.120> beating<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> crap<00:02:27.780> out<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> him

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
head they're beating the crap out of him

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.140 
head they're beating the crap out of him
another<00:02:28.980> theory<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.610> they're<00:02:29.940> actually

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
another theory is that they're actually

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.080 
another theory is that they're actually
beating<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.080> his<00:02:31.260> dignity<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.370> physical

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
beating up his dignity in the physical

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.530 
beating up his dignity in the physical
way

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
way

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
way
that<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> show<00:02:34.080> portrays<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.220> woman's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that the show portrays the woman's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.759 
that the show portrays the woman's
reactions<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.300> actually<00:02:36.780> how<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.170> feels

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
reactions is actually how he feels

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.309 
reactions is actually how he feels
emotionally<00:02:38.550> inside<00:02:39.239> both<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.989> those<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
emotionally inside both of those are a

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.110 
emotionally inside both of those are a
little<00:02:40.620> bit<00:02:40.890> iffy<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.280> my<00:02:41.430> opinion<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.000> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
little bit iffy in my opinion but I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.270 
little bit iffy in my opinion but I
think<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.480> provide<00:02:42.750> good<00:02:43.500> explanations

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
think they provide good explanations

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.190 
think they provide good explanations
behind<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.120> also<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.750> look<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
behind it and also if you look at the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.199 
behind it and also if you look at the
way<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.500> he<00:02:46.650> acts<00:02:46.920> towards<00:02:47.370> women<00:02:47.670> he<00:02:47.970> never

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
way that he acts towards women he never

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.360 
way that he acts towards women he never
wants<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.660> be<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.200> relationship<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.190> them

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
wants to be in a relationship with them

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.490 
wants to be in a relationship with them
and<00:02:50.580> he's<00:02:50.700> never<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.150> oh<00:02:51.299> my<00:02:51.569> god<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.989> am<00:02:52.200> going

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and he's never like oh my god I am going

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.280 
and he's never like oh my god I am going
to<00:02:53.010> wine<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.640> dine<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.360> girl<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.930> take<00:02:55.140> her

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
to wine and dine this girl and take her

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.289 
to wine and dine this girl and take her
out<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.470> dates<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> best<00:02:56.610> guy<00:02:56.819> ever<00:02:57.030> to

out on dates and be the best guy ever to

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.420 
out on dates and be the best guy ever to
her<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.750> always<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.380> let's<00:02:58.829> go<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.190> date

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
her it's always just let's go on a date

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.789 
her it's always just let's go on a date
and<00:02:59.610> that's<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.660> there's<00:03:01.170> never<00:03:01.349> anything

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and that's it there's never anything

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.559 
and that's it there's never anything
more<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.849> don't<00:03:02.970> know<00:03:03.120> about<00:03:03.329> you

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
more to it now I don't know about you

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.240 
more to it now I don't know about you
but<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> was<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.290> kid<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.799> would<00:03:04.860> say

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
but when I was a kid and I would say

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.490 
but when I was a kid and I would say
most<00:03:05.459> kids<00:03:05.819> didn't<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.900> concept

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
most kids didn't really have the concept

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.559 
most kids didn't really have the concept
of<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:07.950> fully<00:03:08.280> goes<00:03:08.610> into<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> relationship

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
of what fully goes into a relationship

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.960 
of what fully goes into a relationship
besides<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.890> dates<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.459> then<00:03:11.790> getting

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
besides going on dates and then getting

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.059 
besides going on dates and then getting
married<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.720> maybe<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.170> why<00:03:13.410> he<00:03:13.680> doesn't

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
married so maybe that's why he doesn't

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.920 
married so maybe that's why he doesn't
have<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> full<00:03:14.610> concept<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.209> his<00:03:15.329> head<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.690> what

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
have a full concept in his head of what

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.080 
have a full concept in his head of what
a<00:03:15.959> relationship<00:03:16.620> looks<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.549> more<00:03:17.760> thing

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
a relationship looks like one more thing

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.569 
a relationship looks like one more thing
he's<00:03:18.540> best<00:03:18.989> friends<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.160> girl

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
he's best friends with the little girl

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.300 
he's best friends with the little girl
next<00:03:20.880> door<00:03:21.239> why<00:03:21.660> would<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> 24<00:03:22.319> 25<00:03:22.739> year<00:03:22.980> old<00:03:23.100> guy

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
next door why would a 24 25 year old guy

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.069 
next door why would a 24 25 year old guy
have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> best<00:03:24.120> friend<00:03:24.480> that's<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.810> little

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
have a best friend that's a little

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.349 
have a best friend that's a little
slight<00:03:25.620> 6<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.130> 7<00:03:26.400> year<00:03:26.549> old<00:03:26.670> girl<00:03:26.760> it's

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
slight 6 or 7 year old girl it's

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.479 
slight 6 or 7 year old girl it's
actually<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.220> aren't

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
actually because they just really aren't

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
actually because they just really aren't
that<00:03:29.639> far<00:03:30.060> apart<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:30.750> gonna<00:03:30.840> actually

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that far apart so I'm gonna actually

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.199 
that far apart so I'm gonna actually
tried<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.500> use<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.370> debunk<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> theory

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
tried to use this to debunk the theory

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.780 
tried to use this to debunk the theory
by<00:03:33.359> saying<00:03:33.630> yeah<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:34.920> time<00:03:35.190> she<00:03:35.430> took<00:03:35.609> him

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
by saying yeah but one time she took him

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.789 
by saying yeah but one time she took him
for<00:03:35.970> Show<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.150> Tell<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.810> all<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.590> kids

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
for Show and Tell and all the kids

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.500 
for Show and Tell and all the kids
thought<00:03:38.100> he<00:03:38.280> was<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.609> superhero<00:03:39.150> or

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
thought he was like a superhero or

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930 
thought he was like a superhero or
something<00:03:39.840> again<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:41.069> think<00:03:41.190> when<00:03:41.639> you're

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
something again I think when you're

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.449 
something again I think when you're
younger<00:03:42.299> when<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.049> look<00:03:43.350> up<00:03:43.560> at<00:03:43.709> older<00:03:44.160> kids

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
younger when you look up at older kids

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.640 
younger when you look up at older kids
you<00:03:44.760> think<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.269> them<00:03:45.389> as<00:03:45.569> some<00:03:45.810> sort<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:46.260> really

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
you think of them as some sort of really

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.590 
you think of them as some sort of really
cool<00:03:47.069> person<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.910> when<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.090> was<00:03:48.299> in<00:03:48.420> first

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
cool person like when I was in first

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.190 
cool person like when I was in first
grade<00:03:48.810> eighth<00:03:49.470> graders<00:03:50.040> were<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> most<00:03:50.609> giant

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
grade eighth graders were the most giant

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.259 
grade eighth graders were the most giant
terrifying<00:03:52.200> people<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.739> me<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.130> now<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.730> really

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
terrifying people to me and now I really

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.759 
terrifying people to me and now I really
don't<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.600> an<00:03:54.780> eighth<00:03:54.900> grader<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.260> don't<00:03:55.590> want

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
don't see an eighth grader I don't want

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.470 
don't see an eighth grader I don't want
to<00:03:55.829> punch<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.190> face<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.850> greater<00:03:57.120> suck

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
to punch in the face if greater suck

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.509 
to punch in the face if greater suck
isn't<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.079> possible<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.680> these<00:03:58.980> kids<00:03:59.340> who

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
isn't it possible that these kids who

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.819 
isn't it possible that these kids who
saw<00:03:59.819> Johnny<00:04:00.329> were<00:04:00.569> like<00:04:00.720> oh<00:04:00.870> my<00:04:01.200> god<00:04:01.440> she

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
saw Johnny were like oh my god she

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.800 
saw Johnny were like oh my god she
brought<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.069> second<00:04:02.670> grader<00:04:02.849> in<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.389> that's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
brought a second grader in here that's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.440 
brought a second grader in here that's
so<00:04:04.170> cool<00:04:04.590> maybe<00:04:05.130> I'm<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> loser<00:04:05.609> but<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.180> think<00:04:06.359> I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
so cool maybe I'm a loser but I think I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.819 
so cool maybe I'm a loser but I think I
would<00:04:06.599> have<00:04:06.690> done<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.230> speaking<00:04:07.709> of

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
would have done that and speaking of

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.460 
would have done that and speaking of
classes<00:04:08.370> Johnny<00:04:08.730> Bravo<00:04:09.209> also<00:04:09.690> takes<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.139> karate

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
classes Johnny Bravo also takes a karate

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.620 
classes Johnny Bravo also takes a karate
class<00:04:10.739> with<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.099> bunch<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.489> little<00:04:11.639> kids<00:04:11.790> maybe

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
class with a bunch of little kids maybe

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.449 
class with a bunch of little kids maybe
it<00:04:12.840> was<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:13.109> comedic<00:04:13.230> purposes<00:04:13.769> or<00:04:14.190> maybe

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it was for comedic purposes or maybe

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.550 
it was for comedic purposes or maybe
it's<00:04:14.730> because<00:04:14.910> he's<00:04:15.359> 8<00:04:15.630> years<00:04:15.660> old<00:04:16.109> are<00:04:16.440> you

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
it's because he's 8 years old are you

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.529 
it's because he's 8 years old are you
getting<00:04:17.070> where<00:04:17.310> I'm<00:04:17.459> coming<00:04:17.880> from<00:04:17.910> do<00:04:18.359> you

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
getting where I'm coming from do you

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.670 
getting where I'm coming from do you
smell<00:04:18.810> what<00:04:18.870> I'm<00:04:19.200> cooking

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
smell what I'm cooking

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500 
smell what I'm cooking
are<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.070> picking<00:04:20.489> up<00:04:20.639> what<00:04:20.880> I'm<00:04:21.060> putting<00:04:21.479> down

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
are you picking up what I'm putting down

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.659 
are you picking up what I'm putting down
the<00:04:22.169> last<00:04:22.349> two<00:04:22.590> bits<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.919> evidence<00:04:23.130> I've<00:04:23.490> got

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
the last two bits of evidence I've got

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.940 
the last two bits of evidence I've got
for<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.300> theory<00:04:24.720> are<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.320> when<00:04:25.440> he's<00:04:25.680> going

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
for this theory are that when he's going

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.710 
for this theory are that when he's going
on<00:04:26.250> dates<00:04:26.640> with<00:04:26.940> women<00:04:27.180> he's

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
on dates with women he's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.810 
on dates with women he's
actually<00:04:28.170> going<00:04:28.380> on<00:04:28.590> play<00:04:28.980> dates<00:04:29.010> with<00:04:29.490> girls

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
actually going on play dates with girls

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.540 
actually going on play dates with girls
has<00:04:30.150> age<00:04:30.390> or<00:04:30.870> maybe<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.710> women<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.340> he

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
has age or maybe the women that he

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.220 
has age or maybe the women that he
thinks<00:04:32.790> he's<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.300> go<00:04:33.510> see<00:04:33.750> are<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
thinks he's going to go see are the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.230 
thinks he's going to go see are the
mothers<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> girls<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.790> he's<00:04:35.940> having

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
mothers of the girls that he's having

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.850 
mothers of the girls that he's having
these<00:04:36.330> play<00:04:36.570> dates<00:04:36.810> with<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.290> when<00:04:37.620> he's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
these play dates with and when he's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.010 
these play dates with and when he's
driving<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.760> these<00:04:38.880> play<00:04:39.150> dates<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.600> his<00:04:39.720> car

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
driving to these play dates in his car

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.340 
driving to these play dates in his car
he's<00:04:40.350> actually<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> big<00:04:41.370> wheel

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.490 

so<00:04:45.040> yes<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.760> conspiracy<00:04:46.120> theory<00:04:46.840> does<00:04:47.200> fall

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
so yes this conspiracy theory does fall

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.590 
so yes this conspiracy theory does fall
into<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:48.370> all<00:04:48.820> in<00:04:48.970> his<00:04:49.060> head

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
into the it's all in his head

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.350 
into the it's all in his head
category<00:04:50.320> which<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.770> kind<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.940> my<00:04:52.210> opinion

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
category which is kind of in my opinion

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480 
category which is kind of in my opinion
getting<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.080> little<00:04:53.260> bit<00:04:53.500> old<00:04:53.770> nonetheless

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
getting a little bit old nonetheless

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.550 
getting a little bit old nonetheless
whether<00:04:55.060> it's<00:04:55.270> true<00:04:55.540> or<00:04:55.720> not<00:04:55.750> no<00:04:56.110> matter<00:04:56.170> what
