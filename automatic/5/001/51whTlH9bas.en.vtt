00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.259

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.360
 very important for the growth of your 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.540
 reputation building always what 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.010

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.050

 the business to a person that you know 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.500
 in the way that person does not 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.540
 knows who will go but trust 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.340

 that will help us a little hello like 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.020
 they are good I think that the building 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.230
 same so that you can 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.290
 understand 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.530
 what is the building changes the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.860
 people's perspective of how they see 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.120
 things for example right now you 're 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.280
 watching life 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.530
 and I begin I say look here 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.440
 I'm with my friend Christmas Mentals 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.050
 you do not know it, you do not see it as a 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.150
 person x a normal person but I 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.700
 I can make your value is this 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.120
 information because if I tell you that 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 david armendáriz is an entrepreneur is a 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.920
 of the first people that started in 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 this business in the texas step is a 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.150
 person who has an organization of 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.670
 more than 100 people is a person who 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.640
 has helped many people generate 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.810
 income that is a leader and I'll start you 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.250
 to talk about him then what he says 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.700
 regardless if it's good or not 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 good is going to have a power in you because 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.770
 because then you already know who David is and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.810
 that's very important what's important is 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.510
 that when you take a prospect to 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.280
 a presentation or you present it to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.380
 do with the person who invited you to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.900
 business with your leaders or in the company 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.780
 in which you are that you learn to 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.600
 build because the building is what 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.710
 build your check the building you 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.470
 you'll 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.450
 the reputation of people with 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.660
 that you are working 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.270
 independently look at this 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.070
 you invite a person to see him on 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.100
 business not to a presentation of your 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.620
 company you know it is not so 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.240
 important what that person the person 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.780
 that is going to speak is going to say you know that no 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.730
 It is so important that he made the 80th 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.160
 percent what did the job was the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.050
 building that you had both before 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.600
 sorry if you did not do a good 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.060
 building if you do not build you to 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.440
 the person who is going to speak to the company 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 to your back 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.880
 to your team with the people that you 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.340
 are you really working what they say 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.620
 those people is going to be irrelevant those 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.800
 people that you invite the same and do not go to 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.750
 power will not be paying attention 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.910
 then the most important thing in 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.060
 this industry is that you learn the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.550
 ability to build and see the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.160
 positive things because I do not know there's a 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.890
 difference between flattering this is not about 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.460
 from there I will adore people no no 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.190
 do not 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.440
 the building is something of heart something 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.500
 that you get out of here inside and really 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.590
 that you see how positive they are with the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.130
 people that you are working because 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.410
 independently whatever 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.450
 simply because you flatten on the person 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.700
 who invited you to this business because 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.640
 has a merit there invited you to the business 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.220
 he thought of you and simply because of that he deserves 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.340
 a building not because if you learn to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.130
 build presentations your team the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080
 upline this and the company in which you 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.090
 're working that will make 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.310
 grow your check then then you 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.010
 We recommend that as soon as possible 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.770
 possible learn what is being 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.630
 stability in health 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.650
 well there you have it good advice 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.510
 valuable 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.820
 the important thing when you watch a video 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.960
 as this is to apply it then it is 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.490
 learn to intern on the internet 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.160
 internalize it with how to have it 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.080
 internally and you can apply it 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.610
 then it is also to teach it to 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.800
 people who are in your organization 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.800
 we wish you much success until then
