00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.079 

we<00:00:01.530> talked<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:02.340> pinging<00:00:02.639> system<00:00:04.040> or

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
we talked about the pinging system or

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.320 
we talked about the pinging system or
two<00:00:06.440> there<00:00:08.059> that<00:00:10.219> used<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> dictionary

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
two there that used in the dictionary

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.709 
two there that used in the dictionary
used<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.200> organize<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.519> words<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
used to organize the words in the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.900 
used to organize the words in the
dictionary<00:00:15.920> following<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.490> order

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
dictionary following that kind of order

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
dictionary following that kind of order
and<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.890> good<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.480> how<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.010> say

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and it's all good if you know how to say

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
and it's all good if you know how to say
the<00:00:23.250> word<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.760> you're<00:00:24.060> looking<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.510> according

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the word and you're looking up according

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.099 
the word and you're looking up according
to<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> pronunciation<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.730> specific<00:00:27.300> word<00:00:27.510> but

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to the pronunciation a specific word but

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.960 
to the pronunciation a specific word but
what<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.189> word<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> don't

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
what if you see a word that you don't

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.380 
what if you see a word that you don't
understand<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:32.130> it's

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
understand you don't know how it's

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.709 
understand you don't know how it's
pronounced<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> have

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
pronounced like this one and so you have

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.740 
pronounced like this one and so you have
to<00:00:42.870> rely<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.940> structure<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
to rely on the structure of the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
to rely on the structure of the
character<00:00:48.750> itself<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.160> look<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
character itself and then look up the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.139 
character itself and then look up the
pronunciation<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.680> meaning<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
pronunciation and the meaning in a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.400 
pronunciation and the meaning in a
reverse<00:00:54.570> manner<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> usually<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.020> Chinese

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
reverse manner so usually in the Chinese

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.029 
reverse manner so usually in the Chinese
dictionaries<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.870> addition<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.379> pinging

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
dictionaries in addition to the pinging

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.660 
dictionaries in addition to the pinging
system<00:01:03.769> there<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.949> field<00:01:06.229> index<00:01:07.229> pages<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
system there are field index pages and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
system there are field index pages and
we<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.030> call<00:01:09.240> them<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> stages<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we just call them in the stages that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.960 
we just call them in the stages that
will<00:01:10.950> list<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:12.210> characters<00:01:12.780> according<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
will list the characters according to

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.219 
will list the characters according to
the<00:01:15.170> structure<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.770> character<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.229> we

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the structure of the character so we

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
the structure of the character so we
call<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:19.850> stroke<00:01:20.850> count<00:01:21.270> system<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.799> when

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
call them stroke count system so when

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.690 
call them stroke count system so when
you<00:01:23.729> write<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.360> Chinese<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> come<00:01:26.430> how

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you write a Chinese you have to come how

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.960 
you write a Chinese you have to come how
many<00:01:26.729> strokes<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.640> look<00:01:29.820> them

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
many strokes so that you can look them

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
many strokes so that you can look them
up<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> dictionary<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
up in the dictionary so this is one

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.630 
up in the dictionary so this is one
stroke<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.420> another<00:01:36.930> stroke<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
stroke this is another stroke this is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.840 
stroke this is another stroke this is
another<00:01:39.000> stroke<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.829> another<00:01:41.159> stroke<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
another stroke this is another stroke so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
another stroke this is another stroke so
basically<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.780> four<00:01:43.110> stroke<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
basically that's a four stroke so you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
basically that's a four stroke so you
will<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.740> four<00:01:47.220> stroke<00:01:48.110> version<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
will go to the four stroke version of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
will go to the four stroke version of
the<00:01:50.000> index<00:01:51.200> dictionary<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:53.040> find<00:01:56.030> number<00:01:57.030> four

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the index dictionary to find number four

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 
the index dictionary to find number four
and<00:01:57.570> find<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.829> starts<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and find out one that starts with a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
and find out one that starts with a
horizontal<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.579> along<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.240> vicinity<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
horizontal so along the vicinity you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.649 
horizontal so along the vicinity you
will<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:06.649> radical
