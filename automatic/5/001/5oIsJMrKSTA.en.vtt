00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
here and here and eventually of course
that<00:01:39.060> makes<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.329> hole<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.140> walking

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that makes a hole then you're walking

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.880 
that makes a hole then you're walking
home<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:41.970> prevent<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.890> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
home so this will prevent all that and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.850 
home so this will prevent all that and
the<00:01:43.979> hardware<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.869> pretty<00:01:45.869> simple<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> front

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the hardware is pretty simple this front

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
the hardware is pretty simple this front
bolt<00:01:47.490> lines<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> stock<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
bolt lines up with the stock one and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.120 
bolt lines up with the stock one and
then<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.750> points<00:01:52.009> you've<00:01:53.009> got

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
then for the other points you've got

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
then for the other points you've got
these<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.520> hooks<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> hook<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
these little hooks that hook on to the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
these little hooks that hook on to the
frame<00:01:55.470> rails<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.490> screw<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:56.790> down

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
frame rails and you just screw them down

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
frame rails and you just screw them down
the<00:01:57.090> only<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.479> recommend<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.350> using

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the only thing they recommend is using

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.300 
the only thing they recommend is using
anti-seize<00:01:59.850> compound<00:01:59.990> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.350> bolts<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
anti-seize compound on the bolts the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.340 
anti-seize compound on the bolts the
heads<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.210> star<00:02:03.420> pattern<00:02:03.899> deels

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
heads of this little star pattern deels

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.319 
heads of this little star pattern deels
so<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.219> an<00:02:05.460> Allen<00:02:05.969> wrench<00:02:06.000> you'll<00:02:06.240> have

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
so it's not an Allen wrench you'll have

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.520 
so it's not an Allen wrench you'll have
to<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:06.540> sure<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to make sure you have that you have that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.180 
to make sure you have that you have that
kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> bit<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.179> able<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> drive<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.810> in

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
kind of bit to be able to drive it in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.589 
kind of bit to be able to drive it in
putting<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.550> fairly<00:02:11.760> simple<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
putting it on it's fairly simple the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.940 
putting it on it's fairly simple the

it's<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.580> spacer<00:02:24.000> because<00:02:24.150> there's<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it's kind of a spacer because there's a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
it's kind of a spacer because there's a
little<00:02:24.660> bit<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.840> an<00:02:24.930> indentation<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.590> your

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
little bit of an indentation there your

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.260 
little bit of an indentation there your
bike<00:02:26.220> will<00:02:26.400> vary<00:02:26.580> depending<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.090> bike

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.300 
bike will vary depending on what bike
you<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.530> started<00:02:29.010> loose

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you have so I get that one started loose

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.210 
you have so I get that one started loose
then<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.209> move<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.569> around<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.379> kind<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
then I can move this around and kind of

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100 
then I can move this around and kind of
wrangle<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:33.180> other<00:02:33.360> ones<00:02:33.599> into<00:02:33.870> place

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
wrangle these other ones into place

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.839 
wrangle these other ones into place
there's<00:02:34.470> two<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.830> back<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.760> the

there's two on the back and one on the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.390 
there's two on the back and one on the
front<00:02:36.530> put<00:02:37.530> some<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.800> anti-seize

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
front put some of this anti-seize

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.119 
front put some of this anti-seize
compound<00:02:38.430> inside<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.959> nuts<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:40.980> get

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
compound inside of the nuts you can get

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.890 
compound inside of the nuts you can get
that<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.430> any<00:02:41.580> auto<00:02:41.790> parts<00:02:42.180> store<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
that at any auto parts store so you can

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.210 
that at any auto parts store so you can
see<00:02:43.019> inside<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.500> nut<00:02:43.680> there's<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> little

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
see inside of the nut there's a little

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.280 
see inside of the nut there's a little
bit<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> crud<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.629> it's<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.870> anti-seize

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
bit of crud in there it's as anti-seize

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.479 
bit of crud in there it's as anti-seize
compound<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.920> that's<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.340> make

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
compound and that's going to just make

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.369 
compound and that's going to just make
sure<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.879> can<00:02:48.030> screw<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:48.959> when<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.200> need

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
sure that we can screw up when we need

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.990 
sure that we can screw up when we need
to<00:02:50.000> final<00:02:51.000> install

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000

bolts<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.150> torqued<00:02:54.300> down<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:56.459> only<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.760> I'd

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
bolts are torqued down the only one I'd

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.490 
bolts are torqued down the only one I'd
worry<00:02:57.120> about<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.690> bolt<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> middle

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
worry about is this bolt in the middle

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.770 
worry about is this bolt in the middle
you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.370> see<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.849> hangs<00:03:00.060> down<00:03:00.150> lower<00:03:00.510> than<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
you can see it hangs down lower than the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.000 
you can see it hangs down lower than the
rest<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> bash<00:03:01.349> plate<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.739> that's<00:03:01.890> gonna

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
rest of the bash plate so that's gonna

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.309 
rest of the bash plate so that's gonna
become<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.310> bash<00:03:02.550> bolt<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.180> stock<00:03:03.750> honda<00:03:04.080> bolts

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
become a bash bolt the stock honda bolts

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.220 
become a bash bolt the stock honda bolts
were<00:03:04.470> recessed<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.459> bolts<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> back<00:03:06.269> the

were recessed the bolts on the back the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.080 
were recessed the bolts on the back the
plate<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.860> arches<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
plate kind of arches so you know the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
plate kind of arches so you know the
ones<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> back<00:03:09.720> are<00:03:10.019> really<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.250> way

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
ones in the back are really in the way

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.100 
ones in the back are really in the way
they<00:03:11.580> could<00:03:11.760> still<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.060> banged<00:03:12.330> but<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.750> one

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
they could still get banged but the one

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.890 
they could still get banged but the one
I<00:03:13.140> worry<00:03:13.379> about<00:03:13.560> most<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:13.980> front<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.900> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
I worry about most is this front one and
