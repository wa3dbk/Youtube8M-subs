and as you can see the key to it is
lasers<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> I'm<00:00:49.649> let's<00:00:50.309> take<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> look<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
lasers so I'm let's take a look at the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.470 
lasers so I'm let's take a look at the
board<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.610> we'll<00:00:53.610> explain<00:00:53.969> how<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> game

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
board and we'll explain how the game

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
board and we'll explain how the game
works<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> cat<00:00:56.399> 2.0<00:00:57.680> 2.0<00:00:58.680> depending

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
works so this is cat 2.0 2.0 depending

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.849 
works so this is cat 2.0 2.0 depending
on<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> call<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> aim

on what you want to call it and the aim

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.960 
on what you want to call it and the aim
of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> game<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.970> your

of the game is you have to take out your

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
of the game is you have to take out your
opponent's<00:01:06.510> Pharaoh<00:01:08.420> here<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.340> you've

opponent's Pharaoh here he is and you've

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.870 
opponent's Pharaoh here he is and you've
got<00:01:12.049> numerous<00:01:13.049> other<00:01:13.409> pieces<00:01:13.700> these<00:01:14.700> are

pyramids<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.400> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
pyramids and as you can see they are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.920 
pyramids and as you can see they are
mirror<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> them<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> sides

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
mirror on them but not all the sides

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.370 
mirror on them but not all the sides
we'll<00:01:21.930> explain<00:01:22.290> those<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> minute

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
we'll explain those in a minute

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.399 
we'll explain those in a minute
you<00:01:25.380> could<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:25.650> Anubis<00:01:26.130> guys<00:01:26.990> these<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.229> um

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you could these Anubis guys these are um

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
you could these Anubis guys these are um
these<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.299> main<00:01:30.420> play

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
these are like some of your main play

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.280 
these are like some of your main play
pieces<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.829> finally<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.540> scarabs

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
pieces and finally you have scarabs

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
pieces and finally you have scarabs
if<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.280> look<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> scarabs<00:01:36.030> you'll<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
if we look at the scarabs you'll see

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
if we look at the scarabs you'll see
that<00:01:36.720> look<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.290> mirrors<00:01:38.250> either<00:01:38.549> side<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.409> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that look at mirrors either side now the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.859 
that look at mirrors either side now the
aim<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> game<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.930> every<00:01:43.350> turn<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
aim of the game is that every turn you

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.080 
aim of the game is that every turn you
get<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> move<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> piece<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.549> kind<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
get to move a piece is it's kind kind of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
get to move a piece is it's kind kind of
very<00:01:51.329> structurally<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.530> chess

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
very structurally it's very like chess

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
very structurally it's very like chess
in<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> start

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
in that you really have to start

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.950 
in that you really have to start
planning<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.140> moves<00:01:56.420> well<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.570> well<00:01:57.750> ahead

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
planning your moves well at well ahead

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
planning your moves well at well ahead
in<00:01:57.990> our<00:01:58.200> bounds<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.640> every<00:02:00.180> turn<00:02:00.450> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
in our bounds but I'm on every turn you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.419 
in our bounds but I'm on every turn you
get<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> choice<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.520> either<00:02:03.710> move<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> piece

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.630 

one<00:02:08.429> square<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.090> an<00:02:09.239> interaction

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
one square in an interaction

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.280 
one square in an interaction
or<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.990> can<00:02:12.140> rotate<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.590> piece<00:02:12.970> 390<00:02:13.970> degrees

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
or you can rotate a piece 390 degrees

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.930 
or you can rotate a piece 390 degrees
once<00:02:15.290> you've<00:02:15.470> done<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:16.190> now<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.910> a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
there go up there and the scan is really

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.250 
there go up there and the scan is really
