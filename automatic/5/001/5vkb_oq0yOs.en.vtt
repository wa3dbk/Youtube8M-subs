00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello and welcome to me 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.019
 Today's a fantastic salad 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 I'll do that with others 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.440
 cashew kernels are still available in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 baked camembert the same 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 first the oven comes and the whole 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 is still on rucola we together with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 balsamic honey and then you go too 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.640
 equal already going first we take a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 nice apple and then cut us 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 a nice ring out about 12 cm 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.140
 can be there and then something nice 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.879
 I'm still removed from the core here 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 and then just rehearsing the edges 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.050
 remove because the shell need if 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.050
 It is not really at the beautiful salad 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.190
 We take the nickel step here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 Casserole dish since I have a very small 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.539
 shot olive oil purely then I would like 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 here the apple ring directly on it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.600
 months in the airy one can do more and more 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040
 it will halve times 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 with so much cheese week with the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 salad for one person so then i put 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 the disc on top and the whole 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 first comes in the oven 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.890
 the oven is running at 200 degrees and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.380
 now comes in our cheese about 20 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 minutes in the oven 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.170
 in the meantime my worth to one 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.159
 component into the game 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.619
 so we can adjust the users right away 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.439
 i can now have cashew kernels here 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.150
 took 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.110
 that's enough in any case you can 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.729
 of course, as an alternative 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.729
 classically use pine nuts 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 in between shake a bit 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.450
 because as you can see here already 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 but already relatively fast brown and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 of course they should not be completely black 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.820
 So the nuts will fill up now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.820
 around 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:07.009
 because the consumption counts again for it 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.300
 on in the autumn on again 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.300
 then there is honey added 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.940
 one to two tablespoons would be enough 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.600
 then comes directly to one more 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.600
 tablespoon butter 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.370
 and now a little gap 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.370
 balsamico 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.510
 half was enough though 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.660
 and then I swing that whole thing myself 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 that connects everything nicely now 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.030
 at level 2 2 to 3 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 so that the whole thing is still warm 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.540
 and if our cheese is the same school 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.569
 the oven then I could also 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.770
 Serve directly 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.850
 I have a delicious one now 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.860
 arugula salad 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.040
 I have a small bed first 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.300
 now a little bit from serving 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.120
 wonderful the child takes now too 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.220
 I'm ready now 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.680
 our beautiful cashew kernels above 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.810
 the whole is then with the april 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:28.459
 above it then come the others 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.810
 legal must and at the end 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:37.340
 of course our beautiful dressing 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.050

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.940
