00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.310 

now<00:00:25.610> engine<00:00:25.850> turning<00:00:26.360> is<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.600> process<00:00:27.140> of

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
now engine turning is the process of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.530 
now engine turning is the process of
adding<00:00:27.800> swirl<00:00:28.730> marks<00:00:29.090> in<00:00:29.500> unique<00:00:30.500> patterns<00:00:30.980> on

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
adding swirl marks in unique patterns on

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.510 
adding swirl marks in unique patterns on
steel<00:00:32.540> or<00:00:33.350> on<00:00:33.650> metal<00:00:34.040> in<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:34.940> case<00:00:35.230> aluminum

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
steel or on metal in this case aluminum

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.130 
steel or on metal in this case aluminum
so<00:00:37.520> what<00:00:37.760> we're<00:00:37.910> going<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.090> do<00:00:38.300> first

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
so what we're going to do first

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
so what we're going to do first
we've<00:00:39.350> got<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:39.860> trim<00:00:40.370> bezel<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:40.940> we've<00:00:41.090> made

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
we've got a trim bezel that we've made

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.560 
we've got a trim bezel that we've made
for<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.280> Corvette<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.580> this<00:00:44.150> goes<00:00:44.360> in<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
for a Corvette and this goes in the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.720 
for a Corvette and this goes in the
center<00:00:44.870> stack<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.800> first<00:00:46.340> thing<00:00:46.489> we're<00:00:46.640> going

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
center stack and first thing we're going

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.299 
center stack and first thing we're going
to<00:00:46.790> do<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.559> take<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:50.110> row<00:00:51.110> lock<00:00:51.350> pad<00:00:51.680> now<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.130> is

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
to do is take a row lock pad now this is

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.150 
to do is take a row lock pad now this is
a<00:00:52.340> very<00:00:53.150> fine<00:00:53.950> scotch-brite

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
a very fine scotch-brite

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.250 
a very fine scotch-brite
and<00:00:55.640> we're<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.330> go<00:00:56.809> over<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.140> entire

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and we're going to go over the entire

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.370 
and we're going to go over the entire
surface<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> metal<00:00:59.090> now<00:00:59.720> what<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.170> will

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
surface of the metal now what this will

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.710 
surface of the metal now what this will
do<00:01:00.560> is<00:01:00.800> remove<00:01:00.950> any<00:01:01.490> surface<00:01:02.300> imperfections

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
do is remove any surface imperfections

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.740 
do is remove any surface imperfections
that<00:01:03.470> will<00:01:04.309> show<00:01:04.670> through<00:01:05.059> our<00:01:05.360> engine

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
that will show through our engine

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.859 
that will show through our engine
turning<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.290> ruin<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.770> finish<00:01:10.840> all<00:01:11.840> right

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
turning and ruin the finish all right

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.560 
turning and ruin the finish all right
now<00:01:12.080> we<00:01:12.140> have<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.320> nice<00:01:12.560> clean<00:01:12.860> surface<00:01:13.420> free<00:01:14.420> of

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
now we have a nice clean surface free of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.499 
now we have a nice clean surface free of
any<00:01:14.720> dents<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.350> dings<00:01:15.380> or<00:01:15.979> chips<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.210> will

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
any dents and dings or chips that will

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.969 
any dents and dings or chips that will
ruin<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.530> finished<00:01:19.009> look<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.649> next<00:01:21.649> thing<00:01:21.860> we

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
ruin the finished look so next thing we

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.719 
ruin the finished look so next thing we
got<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.160> do<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.610> mark<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.600> our<00:01:23.780> lines<00:01:24.399> for<00:01:25.399> our

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
got to do is mark out our lines for our

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.430 
got to do is mark out our lines for our
engine<00:01:26.030> turning<00:01:26.240> okay<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:26.899> what<00:01:27.170> we've<00:01:27.290> done

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
engine turning okay so what we've done

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.510 
engine turning okay so what we've done
is<00:01:27.590> we've<00:01:27.740> measured<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:30.140> width<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.649> our<00:01:31.220> piece

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
is we've measured the width of our piece

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.490 
is we've measured the width of our piece
so<00:01:31.670> we're<00:01:31.819> going<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.000> draw<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.539> some<00:01:32.780> lines<00:01:33.110> to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
so we're going to draw on some lines to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.059 
so we're going to draw on some lines to
give<00:01:34.009> us<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.250> guide<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:35.179> our<00:01:35.860> engine<00:01:36.860> turning

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
give us a guide for our engine turning

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.270 
give us a guide for our engine turning
so<00:01:37.850> we<00:01:38.750> using<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.530> couple<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.009> different

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
so we using a couple of different

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.710 
so we using a couple of different
straight<00:01:40.490> edges<00:01:40.819> here<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.270> keep<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.569> all

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
straight edges here to keep it all

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.719 
straight edges here to keep it all
square<00:01:42.789> okay<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:46.039> gives<00:01:46.340> us<00:01:46.550> our

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
square okay so that gives us our

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.580 
square okay so that gives us our
centerline<00:01:47.690> now<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.910> is<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.899> bar<00:01:51.259> that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
centerline now this is this bar that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.210 
centerline now this is this bar that
we're<00:01:51.709> going<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.860> use<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.429> do<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.819> actual

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
we're going to use to do the actual

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.309 
we're going to use to do the actual
turning<00:01:55.300> basically<00:01:56.300> what<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.569> is<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.929> it's

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
turning basically what this is is it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.900 
turning basically what this is is it's
just<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:58.450> cylinder<00:01:59.450> of<00:02:01.869> emery<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.619> like<00:02:03.910> what

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
just a cylinder of emery just like what

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.839 
just a cylinder of emery just like what
we<00:02:05.030> use<00:02:05.270> on<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:06.020> roll<00:02:06.200> lock<00:02:06.490> except<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
we use on the roll lock except it's a

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.779 
we use on the roll lock except it's a
specific<00:02:08.479> diameter<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.340> works<00:02:10.520> really

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
specific diameter and it works really

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.760 
specific diameter and it works really
well<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.270> what<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.870> cut<00:02:12.260> off<00:02:12.440> a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
well so what we do is we cut off a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.100 
well so what we do is we cut off a
little<00:02:13.400> section<00:02:13.730> about<00:02:14.599> an<00:02:14.720> inch<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> half

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
little section about an inch and a half

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.900 
little section about an inch and a half
two<00:02:15.440> inches<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.190> we'll<00:02:16.310> put<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.760> our

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
two inches and we'll put that in our

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.870 
two inches and we'll put that in our
drill<00:02:17.450> press<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.520> do<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.700> just

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
drill press but we want to do is just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.160 
drill press but we want to do is just
take<00:02:20.060> this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
take this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
take this
we<00:02:22.620> want<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:22.980> an<00:02:23.070> idea<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.790> how<00:02:24.090> wide<00:02:24.480> this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
we want to get an idea of how wide this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.310 
we want to get an idea of how wide this
is<00:02:25.370> okay<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.670> half-inch

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
is okay and this is about a half-inch

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.850 
is okay and this is about a half-inch
stick<00:02:31.640> okay<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.900> want<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.590> want<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
stick okay so we want to do we want to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.520 
stick okay so we want to do we want to
make<00:02:35.010> our<00:02:35.160> lines<00:02:35.490> overlap<00:02:36.210> we<00:02:36.990> want<00:02:37.170> our<00:02:37.290> our

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
make our lines overlap we want our our

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.320 
make our lines overlap we want our our
cuts<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.700> overlap<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:41.000> what<00:02:42.000> we're<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.300> to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
cuts to overlap so what we're going to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.250 
cuts to overlap so what we're going to
do<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.840> make<00:02:43.140> each<00:02:43.850> series<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.030> lines<00:02:45.330> about

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
do is make each series of lines about

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.790 
do is make each series of lines about
3/8<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.160> an<00:02:47.310> inch<00:02:47.430> wide<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:49.350> will<00:02:49.560> give

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
3/8 of an inch wide and that will give

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.420 
3/8 of an inch wide and that will give
us<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:50.190> nice<00:02:50.490> overlap<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.070> this<00:02:53.070> should<00:02:53.400> look

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
us a nice overlap and this should look

we're<00:03:15.350> going<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.860> for<00:03:16.070> each<00:03:16.400> hash

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
we're going to do that for each hash

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.170 
we're going to do that for each hash
mark<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:19.250> want<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.460> make<00:03:19.550> sure<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.910> use<00:03:20.150> a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
mark you want to make sure you use a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.930 
mark you want to make sure you use a
section<00:03:21.080> that<00:03:21.580> does<00:03:22.580> not<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:24.490> holes<00:03:25.490> in<00:03:25.850> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
chucked up into our drill press now

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.710 
chucked up into our drill press now
we're<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.240> make<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:10.070> go<00:04:11.070> from<00:04:11.720> bottom

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
we're going to make this go from bottom

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.020 
we're going to make this go from bottom
to<00:04:13.200> top<00:04:13.410> or<00:04:13.860> left<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.250> right<00:04:14.280> however<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.880> want

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
to top or left to right however you want

to top or left to right however you want
to<00:04:15.060> look<00:04:15.570> at<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.160> one<00:04:17.160> side<00:04:17.430> then<00:04:17.820> we'll<00:04:17.910> move

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
to look at it one side then we'll move

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.449 
to look at it one side then we'll move
down<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.420> next<00:04:18.450> line<00:04:18.950> come<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.070> opposite

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
down to the next line come the opposite

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.090 
down to the next line come the opposite
direction<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:21.500> then<00:04:22.500> move<00:04:22.650> back<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.010> other

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
direction and then move back the other

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.320 
direction and then move back the other
way<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.430> will<00:04:23.640> give<00:04:23.790> us<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.120> cross<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
way this will give us a cross over and

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.390 
way this will give us a cross over and
looking<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.660> fish<00:04:28.290> scales<00:04:28.590> should<00:04:29.250> look

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
looking like fish scales should look

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.790 
looking like fish scales should look
pretty<00:04:29.430> good<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:30.360> we<00:04:30.960> want<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.290> Center<00:04:31.560> this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
pretty good now we want to Center this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.440 
pretty good now we want to Center this
on<00:04:32.120> each<00:04:33.320> crosshair<00:04:34.640> that'll<00:04:35.640> give<00:04:35.790> us<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
on each crosshair that'll give us the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.300 
on each crosshair that'll give us the
nice<00:04:36.660> overlap<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:37.440> we're<00:04:37.560> looking<00:04:37.830> for<00:04:38.040> and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
nice overlap that we're looking for and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:48.100 
nice overlap that we're looking for and
this<00:04:38.640> should<00:04:38.820> look<00:04:38.850> pretty<00:04:39.210> good

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:23.320 

surely<00:05:08.760> starting<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.300> show<00:05:09.750> up<00:05:09.780> now

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
all right and there we go 20 minutes to

do this whole piece not including the
markup<00:05:31.260> that's<00:05:32.010> pretty<00:05:32.340> good<00:05:32.520> now<00:05:33.510> we're

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
markup that's pretty good now we're

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.920 
markup that's pretty good now we're
going<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.780> check<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.080> out<00:05:34.200> on<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.740> car
