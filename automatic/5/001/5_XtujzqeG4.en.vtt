00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sometimes and I may decide that I don't

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
sometimes and I may decide that I don't
knew<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> pattern<00:01:10.680> says<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> under

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
knew what the pattern says for the under

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
knew what the pattern says for the under
the<00:01:11.850> thumb<00:01:12.060> mmmm<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.659> something<00:01:12.960> else<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.690 
the thumb mmmm I do something else and
but<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.740> by<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> time<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.189> comes<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
but then by the time it comes around to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
them both at the same time so I cast on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
them both at the same time so I cast on
two<00:01:29.909> stitches<00:01:29.939> hearing<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> under<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
two stitches hearing for the under the

two stitches hearing for the under the
thumb<00:01:31.530> rather<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.520> wondering<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.119> gee<00:01:33.329> did<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
thumb rather than wondering do gee did I

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
thumb rather than wondering do gee did I
increase<00:01:33.960> when<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> cast<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.770> did<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
increase when I cast on what did I do to
