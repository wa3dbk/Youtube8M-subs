game planning for this while i've been
playing<00:03:02.650> wet<00:03:03.190> side<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.670> essentially<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
playing wet side is essentially in the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.240 
playing wet side is essentially in the
same<00:03:04.540> situation<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.470> flock<00:03:05.890> otherwise

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
same situation that flock otherwise

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.449 
same situation that flock otherwise
where<00:03:07.410> he's<00:03:08.410> got<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.709> first<00:03:08.950> character

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
where he's got this first character

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.570 
where he's got this first character
that's<00:03:10.120> really<00:03:10.540> capable<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> kill<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
that's really capable of the kill and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.259 
that's really capable of the kill and
it's<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.060> hard<00:03:13.300> for<00:03:13.360> him<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.600> get<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:15.269> his

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
it's just so hard for him to get in his

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.479 
it's just so hard for him to get in his
next<00:03:16.600> character<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.800> pretty<00:03:17.950> decently

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
next character can do pretty decently

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.130 
next character can do pretty decently
against<00:03:18.850> more<00:03:19.060> again<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:19.750> coming<00:03:19.930> in

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
against more again it's just coming in

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.800 
against more again it's just coming in
at<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> disadvantage<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.269> not<00:03:22.420> able<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.690> get

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
at a disadvantage it was not able to get

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.090 
at a disadvantage it was not able to get
anything<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:23.560> chris<00:03:23.769> g<00:03:23.920> has<00:03:24.070> a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
anything going because chris g has a

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.979 
anything going because chris g has a
strong<00:03:24.519> defense<00:03:24.970> despite<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.720> fact<00:03:25.870> that

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
strong defense despite the fact that

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.170 
strong defense despite the fact that
Virgil<00:03:26.620> was<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.860> good<00:03:27.130> where<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.550> girl<00:03:27.790> mom<00:03:27.940> was

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
Virgil was so good where a girl mom was

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.720 
Virgil was so good where a girl mom was
so<00:03:28.330> good<00:03:28.569> against<00:03:28.840> more<00:03:29.400> well<00:03:30.400> Bryce<00:03:30.550> might

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so good against more well Bryce might

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.890 
so good against more well Bryce might
actually<00:03:30.880> did<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.420> again<00:03:31.510> with

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
actually did get in again with

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.660 
actually did get in again with
spider-man<00:03:32.230> against<00:03:32.530> Morgan<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.430> first

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
spider-man against Morgan in the first

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.640 
spider-man against Morgan in the first
round<00:03:33.850> but<00:03:34.000> he<00:03:34.150> didn't<00:03:34.420> he<00:03:34.569> didn't<00:03:34.810> finish<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
round but he didn't he didn't finish the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
convo yeah and that's it for his

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.699 
convo yeah and that's it for his
character<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.019> play<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> style<00:03:41.620> like

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
character when you play a style like

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.130 
character when you play a style like
this<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:43.150> 10<00:03:43.510> foot<00:03:43.660> ball<00:03:43.810> stretcher

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
this it's a 10 foot ball stretcher

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.050 
this it's a 10 foot ball stretcher
opponent<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.799> probably<00:03:45.220> played<00:03:45.519> into<00:03:45.940> him

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
opponent I probably played into him

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.240 
opponent I probably played into him
dropping<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.450> combo<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:47.019> when<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.070> guess

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
dropping that combo there when I guess

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.100 
dropping that combo there when I guess
the<00:03:48.400> missile<00:03:48.700> saved<00:03:48.970> uh-huh<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.900> get<00:03:53.049> a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
the missile saved uh-huh you gonna get a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.390 
the missile saved uh-huh you gonna get a
couple<00:03:53.320> bars<00:03:53.470> out<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.739> time<00:03:54.070> not<00:03:54.340> quite<00:03:56.310> well<00:03:57.310> I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
couple bars out of time not quite well I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.650 
couple bars out of time not quite well I
don't<00:03:57.489> know<00:03:57.640> he<00:03:57.940> might<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.180> wanted<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.510> ex

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
don't know he might have wanted to ex

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.350 
don't know he might have wanted to ex
back<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.230> yeah<00:03:59.769> maybe<00:04:00.100> but<00:04:00.940> then<00:04:01.180> he<00:04:01.239> at

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
back to that yeah maybe but then he at

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.020 
back to that yeah maybe but then he at
christie's<00:04:01.750> do<00:04:02.049> man<00:04:02.320> who<00:04:02.739> has<00:04:02.920> been<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.280> good

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.440 

dropping<00:04:07.030> eminem's<00:04:10.230> setting<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.290> Morgan<00:04:11.650> yes<00:04:11.920> I

so<00:04:15.940> good<00:04:16.209> well<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.870> think<00:04:17.380> he<00:04:17.590> needed<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:18.070> x

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
so good well I think he needed to x

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.130 
so good well I think he needed to x
factor<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:18.820> against<00:04:19.150> over<00:04:19.419> again<00:04:19.690> she's

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
factor that against over again she's

factor<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.030> mean<00:04:28.180> that's<00:04:28.270> at<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.479> more<00:04:28.690> legit

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
factor I mean that's at the more legit

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.800 
factor I mean that's at the more legit
find<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.100> hard<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.340> do
