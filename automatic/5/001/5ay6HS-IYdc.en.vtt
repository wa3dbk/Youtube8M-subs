00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
 Welcome to our 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 press conference after the second league match 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.689
 vfl bochum 1848 fc heidenheim 1846 as 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.849
 In the match there were five goals 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.670
 distribution this time slightly different 4 to 1 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.630
 for the vfl the endstand I welcome 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970
 not only the ones present here 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.400
 media representatives but also the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.890
 vfl fans in the vip areas of 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.600
 revanche and in moritz and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 of course our fans in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.720
 adjacent 18 48 at my side 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.180
 the podium with a guest frank schmidt 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.820
 Just like our coach has years verbeek 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.989
 and as always, the first word is due 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 Mr schmid offers her comment on the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.399
 late evening first congratulations to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.190
 victory thinks he was of course deserved 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.200
 Over 90 minutes seen 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 there was great pressure from the vfl from the beginning 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430
 also clear that it will come anyway 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.710
 at 1 0 help me tremendously with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.619
 an actually harmless flank in one 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 room where no player from the vfl was 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.350
 we extend though the great there 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.759
 comes out and gave a command 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 could have caught the examples 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.259
 but so we extend this we make this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 flank still dangerous 10 fast the 2 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.750
 0 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 So the ball could not clarify and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.550
 actually only from this phase were 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.080
 we do such a play a little bit in it in 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.060
 which we could provide relief 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.509
 for one or the other actions 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.729
 ahead 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.860
 only towards the end or middle of the first 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.899
 Half time it was then dangerous 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.509
 will have a huge chance for the 2 1 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.310
 as he thinks twice I then holds 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.500
 the vfl the huge chance to 3 0 after 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.240
 a quick free kick then 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 we'll do that 2 1 after that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 eleven meters and I believe in there in the game 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.950
 and you have that in the second one too 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.569
 halfway the first 20 minutes 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.789
 we've done everything right in 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.300
 our offensive play for the 2 to 2 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.520
 do 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.739
 three four really good options we 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.590
 were close in a game in this 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.729
 phase in an open exchange 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.349
 but then we just have a goal 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.880
 and then that is out of these 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.069
 chances we still had to 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.510
 little and of course bochum had the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.440
 chances are one or the other 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.989
 to make a goal 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.670
 they then do the 3 1 there it works 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.650
 then too easy with the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.470
 4 1 and then we were outside playing that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 It was clear we have to be careful now 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.160
 that the result does not get worse 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.050
 we will be lucky for you 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
 if you have the elfmeter hero and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 so under the line as I said 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.940
 a deserved defeat anyway 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.710
 a bit annoying because after the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.580
 Halftime will have the chance then 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.280
 return 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.450
 But we do not have these opportunities 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.160
 used and therefore again 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.080
 congratulations vfl bochum we are 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.740
 that people are disappointed with the game of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.050
 Result her so clearly lost 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.210
 Thanks a lot to Mr schmidt, we come to you 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.010
 analysis from our trainer hertie 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.980
 your comment to the game please in 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.590
 had led moment was not satisfied 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.220
 because we actually played like us 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.580
 to have 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.440
 yes, but in the middle of it, yes, but yes 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.180
 Together the distance was not great 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.730
 enough and the enemy order the lines 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.560
 say very well oh yes with a block 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.770
 of four behind the striker entertained 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.750
 as several difficulties to vote 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.320
 to feel and thomas not at all 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.080
 game 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.340
 So it really surprised us 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.670
 get a gate 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 21 though he may actually be one 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.640
 But I can do two goals or more 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.019
 did not like it 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.739
 I also noticed then I did 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.230
 brought out of here 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.750
 yes my right play right outside 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.060
 gone with with cdu is one 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.970
 dynamics I have his aggressiveness 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.959
 really had rather play on 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.860
 Stephan I had Then change rather 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.920
 a true one has to happen very well 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.160
 has done yes and I have said too 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.400
 we have to try something faster 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.130
 over the blog how much mean 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.820
 understand between the lines the ground 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.180
 to get 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.920
 at half-time you always know the game 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.890
 gets a little longer 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.620
 I think that we from the 50 50th 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.630
 minutes we did well and at 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.960
 the 3 1 had thought that will not work 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.770
 more 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.930
 if you could get the shoe well 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.860
 We still have a goal to play football 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.090
 made and we made it movies 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 but have street road and of course 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.830
 with us a problem but before with 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.660
 Thank you very much if you ask one 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.730
 or both coaches please have me around 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.920
 a short hand signal then becomes them 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.250
 a microphone is enough and it can 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.250
 start 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.190
 that does not seem to be the case 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:19.100
 outside at the bar both from the outside 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.330
 he comes here says just lays down gentleman 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.700
 Participants do not come with a question 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.770
 they have the same startelf 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.200
 in my opinion started as in 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.670
 Nuremberg was that anyway 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.290
 after a few minutes the marcel 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.550
 titsch-rivero due to injury 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.650
 that had to be replaced 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.160
 nevertheless a small setback 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.750
 probably or of course if you are 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.060
 Changing early is not always complete 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.100
 simply but many prix win at the rhine 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.500
 and I find that one thing predominantly 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.580
 also very well done 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.080
 that was definitely not the reason 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.670
 the early change that we have in the 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.720
 defensive have made so many mistakes 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.650
 which ultimately also to the 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.650
 have been victors 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.160
 final question then what had 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.340
 marcel titsch I do not have it 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.530
 just about the he probably a horse kiss and 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.120
 Normally you can get a little worse 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.140
 continue to play a horse kiss but it 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.380
 did not go the muscle has closed 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.130
 and there was no way of life 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.130
 carries on
