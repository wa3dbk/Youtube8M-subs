00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.290
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.720
 The theme of this video is xia 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.639
 I would like to work on this 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.480
 Practice that Pendora xia put in in junior high school age 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.340
 I would like to do three introductions 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.330
 I would like to see this video 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 Pendora or Fore main battle type 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 Such players have some basic skills 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529
 Foreback Tsutuki Drive 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.969
 You should do it after you can do that 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.890
 I want to know how to practice 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180
 If you look at these people, this video will be very useful. 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 I think I do not think in the junior high school age 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.170
 It is the practice method that I put in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.300
 One piece of footwork 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.119
 The 2 is back opposite side Back is opposite side 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.500
 Hard hit 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.539
 The 3 is back to all All back to all 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.819
 I have you let me see it a little slowly 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.079
 I will strike in with all 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 What kind of thought did you actually do not ask the leader 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 I do not know for a while, but 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.019
 After all thinking about basic technology 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.829
 Now I can do it, then pen folder 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.989
 The Fore-War Type should do 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.969
 Move to the point of the ball firmly 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.280
 It is absolutely impossible to hit a strong ball 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.129
 I think it is a necessary condition so I can not move there 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.299
 I can't help if I'm doing it completely 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.900
 Even if you move, hit it and hit a slow ball 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.340
 If you say that a ball without speed or force 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.060
 Because there is no point in the forehand main battle type at all 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.299
 Move firmly to that point and have a strong ball in the foreground 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.049
 It is for the fore main battle type to hit 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.870
 I think one important theme 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.280
 It is this practice method, but take time of one hour 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.159
 20 minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes in a row 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.459
 It was done very much because it was done 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.620
 It was tough but this practice is 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.200
 I think it is one of the foundations of my own play now 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.079
 For pen folder for main battle type 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.709
 I think it will be a very necessary practice 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.700
 I am thinking 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.779
 I hope this practice will be helpful for those 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:03:59.509
 Thank you very much
