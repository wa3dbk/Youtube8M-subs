 the good workshop you can teach me a 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.790
 little your position is another of the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.630
 finalists of the technician challenge 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.009
 he works in dubai 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.540
 you have received offers to go to 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.680
 Middle East ' work for a sheikh to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.360
 another country 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.869
 the truth is that new order that 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.869
 I had raised 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.959
 [Music] 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.259
 Jesus there are many differences between 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 work as a mechanic for ferrari or 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.369
 do it for any other good brand 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 really the work of mechanic then in 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.880
 all brands is similar the basics 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.820
 then in this brand, you have to have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.069
 very careful not to bother anything to do 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.319
 the work very delicate very clean yes 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.509
 it breaks something you have to turn it off or not 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.420
 it usually happens that we usually break 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 nothing but if something broke for bad 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.390
 luck we will not have to pay it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.450
 carbon and things start so 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 It costs a lot to break easily in addition if 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.130
 you try like a little careful trying 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.989
 always guess because the clients are 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.760
 very demanding and do not like to take the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 car and then for some nonsense 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.750
 come back because he makes a roll or 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.340
 anything then you have to try 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.910
 once the car is here that is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 now 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.060
 [Music] 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.320
 as you know here with the pieces of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.970
 replacement because Ferrari only has 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.980
 a factory and it 's so Italian and magical 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.470
 that everything comes from there so we all 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.470
 the parts that we assemble are original 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.230
 Ferrari Ferrari genuine and everything comes 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 factory and do not normally do the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.860
 orders to have a stock here of 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.050
 the most common pieces in reviews and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.140
 what is most often changed and then 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.000
 depending on the car if it has come by 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.010
 a review or to do more work 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.840
 fat is an older car because that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 is if they are special things also what 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.310
 we ask to manufacture 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.870
 and work pretty well and at the most in 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.670
 a couple of days we have here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.440
 Ferrari keeps a stock of all the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.630
 parts needed for most of your 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.900
 models even if they are old if we have 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.940
 the possibility of asking for even ferrari 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.190
 classic that you could get to manufacture 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 some piece if it did not exist can 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940
 take to manufacture it 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.720
 to subscribe much more time or 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.250
 any mechanical operation in a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.360
 Ferrari K in a normal car as per 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.980
 example the change of the belt of 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.420
 distribution then the main 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.670
 difference especially the engines that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.740
 they have the engine after the gt cars in the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.330
 rear motor is that the belt 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.740
 distribution is going to ride forward in 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.150
 roofs in a car that has the engine 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.800
 in front of accessing it is much more 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.590
 simple that in one that have many 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.480
 back the older models are 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.690
 ready to take out the engine and do it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.850
 out for example the 300c behind the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.620
 seats and a stage that does not give 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.390
 distribution what makes it more complicated 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.850
 better than in other brands have a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.280
 front engine but now for example 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.709
 in italy because everything has already evolved 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.140
 they are with chains what produces a lot 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.880
 the maintenance and a great improvement by 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.010
 example now is with the clutch with 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.450
 the double clutch gearboxes 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.359
 that were packets of discs that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.310
 last with normal use the reality of 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.959
 the life of the car exactly that 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.680
 before also changing the clutch every 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.680
 100 kilometers 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.180
 jesus what is your favorite model of 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.220
 ferrari why and what you see is 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.010
 enter through that door and think uff 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.720
 throwing extra hours here how are we doing good 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.510
 to me as what I really like about 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.280
 the cars is the technique and all the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.169
 news and everything right now the 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.660
 california ter with the theme of turbos 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.540
 all this for us is a bit new 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.340
 and the truth that interests me very much to know 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.889
 how it works how it manages the turbos 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.620
 how it has been manufactured to increase the 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.940
 sound that is nicer plus the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.449
 Ferrari sound even if it's the engine 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.419
 Turbo 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.419
 that's what I 'm most interested in 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.849
 4 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.900
 you usually throw when you walk in the door 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:28.469
 really the cars that more hours are 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.469
 they are the old classic cars 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.889
 tremble 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.290
 [Music] 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.849
 good to finish I'll take that 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.249
 I have you here today I'm going to hit you 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.319
 small robbery tell me please three 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.599
 things that virtually nobody knows about 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.210
 ferrari because I think that what most 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.199
 surprise people lately because 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.729
 It has always been a myth that the 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.409
 maintenance of the ferraris is 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.479
 very expensive of a review worth ten 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.449
 thousand euros and things like that are heard 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.669
 they are in two hours since for 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.740
 the 2011 all the new ferraris have 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.270
 seven years of free maintenance so 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.240
 that real ferrari really the 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.849
 maintenance is free 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.949
 and that's the truth surprisingly enough and 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.690
 Well you can also certify the 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.940
 old cars up to the certifier the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.069
 classic and we check that everything 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.690
 This is the original assembly on the engine 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.090
 differential change all the pieces that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.060
 It never has been modified and ferrari makes you 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.199
 a book that then at the time of selling it 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.169
 the truth is that it increases the value of 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.060
 car and well then also 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.750
 that each customer can make the car 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.220
 to your liking and the truth that you have things 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.680
 let's say that no model is the same as 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.720
 the previous one and each client of the age his 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.699
 approach let's say what he dreamed 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.599
 as was his ferrari as you can 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.599
 apply to the car 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.629
 [Music] 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.310
 so you know if you have a ferrari and 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.630
 you want to put your car in the best hands 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.700
 you do not need to take it to maranello 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.320
 because the best ferrari mechanic in 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.320
 world is here in madrid
