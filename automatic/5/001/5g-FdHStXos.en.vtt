00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.970 
feel so good about being apart that
you're<00:02:14.990> never<00:02:15.260> gonna<00:02:15.410> want<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.710> get<00:02:15.800> back

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
you're never gonna want to get back

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.160 
you're never gonna want to get back
together
