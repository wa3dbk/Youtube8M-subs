00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
knows who is picture it um something

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.280 
knows who is picture it um something
happen<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.280> between<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> guy<00:03:15.270> who<00:03:15.330> make<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
happen in between the guy who make the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.980 
happen in between the guy who make the
picture<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.010> between<00:03:17.520> in<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.060> person<00:03:18.690> which

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
picture and between in the person which

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.320 
picture and between in the person which
foot<00:03:19.640> with<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> subject<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.990> photo<00:03:22.470> and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
foot with a subject of that photo and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.640 
foot with a subject of that photo and
what<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.360> find<00:03:24.840> magic<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.490> covers<00:03:27.240> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
what I find magic is that that covers a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.320 
what I find magic is that that covers a
piece<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> metal<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.820> plastic<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:31.260> capture

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
piece of metal and plastic just capture

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.690 
piece of metal and plastic just capture
something<00:03:33.330> which<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.020> not<00:03:34.050> visible<00:03:34.860> which<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
something which is not visible which is

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.320 
something which is not visible which is
just<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.300> between<00:03:36.600> two<00:03:37.230> people<00:03:37.740> something

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
just in between two people something

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.190 
just in between two people something
chronically<00:03:39.330> I'd<00:03:39.570> say<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:41.510> I'll<00:03:42.510> find<00:03:42.930> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
