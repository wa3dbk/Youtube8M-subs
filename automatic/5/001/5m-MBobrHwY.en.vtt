00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
all but I guess that's okay the blade is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
all but I guess that's okay the blade is
just<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.710> hair<00:01:07.950> different<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.750> 585<00:01:10.490> it's

I'm not doing anything wrong so what's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.810 
I'm not doing anything wrong so what's
the<00:02:40.380> initial<00:02:41.660> potential<00:02:42.660> negative<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:44.280> this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the initial potential negative of this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.410 
the initial potential negative of this
this<00:02:45.480> knife<00:02:45.980> okay<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.820> not<00:02:48.000> something<00:02:48.390> you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
this knife okay it's not something you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.960 
this knife okay it's not something you
could<00:02:48.680> easily<00:02:49.680> carry<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.400> every<00:02:50.730> day<00:02:50.820> it's

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
could easily carry around every day it's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.740 
could easily carry around every day it's
a<00:02:51.000> little<00:02:51.239> larger<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:54.390> might<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.690> able

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
a little larger but just might be able

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.740 
a little larger but just might be able
to<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.230> what's<00:02:55.590> what's<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> initial

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
to so what's what's the initial

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.900 
to so what's what's the initial
potential<00:02:57.750> downside<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.980> knife<00:02:59.580> so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
potential downside is the knife so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.520 
potential downside is the knife so
anyone<00:03:00.270> anyone<00:03:01.040> long<00:03:02.040> pause<00:03:02.340> long<00:03:02.940> pause<00:03:03.530> okay

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
pushing down here my fingers are highly

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.330 
pushing down here my fingers are highly
exposed<00:04:11.250> huge<00:04:12.250> amount<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.760> pressure<00:04:12.940> here

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
exposed huge amount of pressure here

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.640 
exposed huge amount of pressure here
that<00:04:15.340> was<00:04:15.490> slowly<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.060> carefully<00:04:16.500> maybe<00:04:17.500> it

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
that was slowly and carefully maybe it

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.470 
that was slowly and carefully maybe it
will<00:04:17.769> loosen<00:04:18.100> up<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.459> little<00:04:18.580> bit<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:20.709> is

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
will loosen up a little bit but that is

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.540 
will loosen up a little bit but that is
amazingly<00:04:22.480> cool<00:04:23.260> see<00:04:23.560> ya<00:04:23.830> i'm<00:04:24.190> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> lose

amazingly cool see ya i'm going to lose

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.940 
amazingly cool see ya i'm going to lose
that<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.530> amazingly<00:04:27.040> hard<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.460> do

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
that it is amazingly hard to do

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.920 
that it is amazingly hard to do
one-handed<00:04:29.950> that<00:04:30.460> spring<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.710> tight

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
one-handed that spring is so tight

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.810 
one-handed that spring is so tight
anyways<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.350> i<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.700> good

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
anyways so i think it's it's a good

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:48.220 
anyways so i think it's it's a good
knife<00:04:36.970> anyways<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:38.620> can<00:04:38.770> use<00:04:38.919> two<00:04:39.100> hands
