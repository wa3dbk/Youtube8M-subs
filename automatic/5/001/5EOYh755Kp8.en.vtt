and<00:01:33.770> specially<00:01:34.770> side<00:01:35.040> bikinis<00:01:35.579> aside<00:01:36.240> with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and specially side bikinis aside with

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.649 
and specially side bikinis aside with
some<00:01:36.689> talented<00:01:37.079> players<00:01:37.700> he<00:01:38.700> plays<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.150> 16

some talented players he plays in 16

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
some talented players he plays in 16
with<00:01:39.840> them<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> looks<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.600> mentally<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
with them so it looks like mentally is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
with them so it looks like mentally is
also<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.909> stable<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.299> comes<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
also very very stable it comes from a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130 
also very very stable it comes from a
family<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:47.000> footballers<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.390> father<00:01:48.659> brother

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
family of footballers the father brother

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.450 
family of footballers the father brother
so<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> his<00:01:50.880> natural<00:01:51.090> habitat<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so I i think is his natural habitat the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
so I i think is his natural habitat the
kid<00:01:53.670> looks<00:01:53.700> very<00:01:54.479> comfortable<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.200> good

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
kid looks very comfortable and good

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.450 
kid looks very comfortable and good
players<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.310> no<00:01:56.460> age<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
players they have no age so I think the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.119 
players they have no age so I think the
kiddies<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:01.500> ready<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.189> make<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.460> impact<00:02:02.759> yes
