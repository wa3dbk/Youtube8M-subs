00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
example is stopping right here cut it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
example is stopping right here cut it
there<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> carbon

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
there right there so this is the carbon

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
there right there so this is the carbon
copy<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.680> chosen<00:01:41.369> six<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> clubs
