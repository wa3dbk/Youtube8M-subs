hey guys J again I just want to make

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey guys J again I just want to make
another<00:00:03.149> quick<00:00:03.419> comparison<00:00:04.230> video<00:00:04.549> preparing

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
another quick comparison video preparing

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.350 
another quick comparison video preparing
the<00:00:05.790> burn<00:00:06.180> box<00:00:06.600> helmet<00:00:07.259> versus<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.550> hand<00:00:09.030> box

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
the burn box helmet versus the hand box

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.839 
the burn box helmet versus the hand box
break<00:00:09.750> now<00:00:10.160> one<00:00:11.160> thing<00:00:11.309> you'll<00:00:11.490> notice<00:00:11.759> right

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
break now one thing you'll notice right

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.499 
break now one thing you'll notice right
away<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.929> size<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:14.309> actual<00:00:14.639> profile<00:00:15.269> is

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
away is the size the actual profile is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.260 
away is the size the actual profile is
definitely<00:00:15.900> larger<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.830> burn<00:00:17.100> box<00:00:17.400> both

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
definitely larger for the burn box both

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
definitely larger for the burn box both
of<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.720> classified<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> low<00:00:19.830> profile

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
of these are classified as a low profile

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.060 
of these are classified as a low profile
but<00:00:20.760> you'll<00:00:21.330> notice<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.080> burn<00:00:22.800> box

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
but you'll notice that the burn box

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.759 
but you'll notice that the burn box
still<00:00:23.550> has<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.180> certified<00:00:24.750> high<00:00:24.960> impact<00:00:25.410> bolt

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
still has the certified high impact bolt

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.790 
still has the certified high impact bolt
inside<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> helmet<00:00:26.599> whereas<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.990> sandbox

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
inside the helmet whereas the sandbox

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
inside the helmet whereas the sandbox
break<00:00:29.099> bucket<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> little<00:00:30.750> profile<00:00:31.170> v8

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
break bucket is just a little profile v8

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220 
break bucket is just a little profile v8
liner<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.790> still<00:00:33.059> home<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.989> just

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
liner so it's still home but I here just

feel I find the book very comfortable to
wear<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.879> tend<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> wear<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.870> helmet<00:00:49.020> without

wear I tend to wear my helmet without
ear<00:00:49.620> pads<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.820> available<00:00:51.480> for

here<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> sand<00:00:55.199> monster<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.590> bucket<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
here for the sand monster a bucket or is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
here for the sand monster a bucket or is
it<00:00:56.699> got<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.210> problem<00:00:57.780> large<00:00:58.559> easier<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.489> burn

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it got one problem large easier to burn

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
it got one problem large easier to burn
but<00:01:00.510> again<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.289> normally<00:01:01.649> wear<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> is
