00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello everyone, you are a group of dotahs and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.780
 in contact with 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.759
 This is a heading dota 2 facts is such a fact 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 that under bkb ult scorpion day 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.320
 sides but slows down the enemy 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.180
 including the book he would be very run 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.180
 runs very slowly damage is not applied 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 following fact 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.460
 now we will see if sand king 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 hide in the sand and its somehow before like 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.239
 either the ally hero moves 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.480
 will remain invisible but will already stand 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.239
 another place yurcu kai 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 here we see the sand we stayed here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 remained as we stand here now viewfinder here 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.969
 if you move anyway go to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.260
 Bay for try the same 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 force staff here again I stand in a visa 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.539
 we are enemies think that if here it is very 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.390
 useful site is my advice but if i already 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.619
 do the same black dagger then you 2 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.619
 will get lost like this 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.369
 The next tip is when sinking 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 casts ult at his too allied pier 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.530
 Union hero somehow budge under 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.179
 now see what happens your 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.179
 giving what when i swing 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:36.149
 that's how you see i started here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 cast and continued during the flight 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.819
 cast finished here and the same 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.580
 can be done with force stuff 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:54.509
 now letâ€™s show ready yes it was necessary 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:58.979
 bills push just yourself and that's how we 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.560
 see the same old reaction itself and so 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.119
 it 's not all the facts about scorpion yet 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.799
 there is one very good fact we include 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.799
 we are waiting for the juice from the sand cat 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.859
 make black 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.139
 very important to do it close to start 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:26.519
 will blink, and you quickly press 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.769
 once again on the sand and the same happens 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.930
 the effect we stay in is sand here 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.930
 here we are waiting for a rollback again 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.080
 so you can do this and how much sand 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.600
 will be here since the time counter 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.760
 constantly updated when I use 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.820
 once again the sand that is like that you see about 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:05.050
 eight seconds again 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:07.840
 the next fact is dota this is what the first 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.780
 skill rights bus at clocks can 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.090
 reduce life more than he ult with 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:20.320
 Aganim now we will check it now 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:25.120
 salewa with us ultiut if seth us so 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.630
 you were 1400 carries us it turns 800 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 life now I will do the same 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.510
 I took him 900 kpc 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.510
 this is this factor 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.500
 so we want to find out how much slark 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.500
 can gain maximum dexterity 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.140
 I see 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.770
 already stolen 500 dexterity 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.400
 but mana ends up warming up the arches 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.300
 we were able to steal 723 agility here 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.560
 so 723 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.560
 come out and hang 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.369
 about 777 agility would be exactly 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.239
 in this video we will tell you what 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:42.809
 tornado invoker of god knock down ulta 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:46.289
 appearance and rune that picked up any 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:49.469
 character well, of course enemy so i 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:55.379
 I take the rune and yuzayu ulta 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:06:01.069
 and it all knocks down a tornado like you 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.069
 see s not the yurt is not any
