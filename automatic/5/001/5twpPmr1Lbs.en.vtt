00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
question this is the stretch it starts

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
question this is the stretch it starts
with<00:00:43.170> Marilyn<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.680> probably<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> Marilyn<00:00:44.520> team

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
with Marilyn and probably a Marilyn team

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
with Marilyn and probably a Marilyn team
that's<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:45.000> quite<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.960> thought

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that's not quite as good as we thought

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
that's not quite as good as we thought
they<00:00:46.649> might<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.670> after<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
they might be but after that the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
they might be but after that the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.729 
had their quarterback sacks 16 times and
now<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.810> compounded<00:02:49.139> by<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.379> fact<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
now it's compounded by the fact that

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.979 
now it's compounded by the fact that
their<00:02:49.920> left<00:02:50.099> tackle<00:02:50.519> Scott<00:02:51.450> Pearlie<00:02:51.720> Mae<00:02:51.750> not

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.449 
their left tackle Scott Pearlie Mae not
playing<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.349> game<00:02:52.500> because<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.799> an<00:02:52.950> injury<00:02:53.099> so

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
playing a game because of an injury so

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
playing a game because of an injury so
you<00:02:54.060> know<00:02:54.180> Rutgers<00:02:54.510> defensive<00:02:54.959> line<00:02:55.109> is

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you know Rutgers defensive line is

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.839 
you know Rutgers defensive line is
licking<00:02:55.500> her<00:02:55.560> chops<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.430> coming<00:02:56.609> off<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.760> game

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
licking her chops it's coming off a game

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.979 
licking her chops it's coming off a game
where<00:02:57.000> Rucker's<00:02:57.239> defense<00:02:57.599> looked<00:02:57.810> well

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
where Rucker's defense looked well

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.210 
where Rucker's defense looked well
obviously<00:02:58.260> gets<00:02:58.500> Norfolk<00:02:58.769> State<00:02:58.889> but<00:02:59.040> still

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
obviously gets Norfolk State but still

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.800 
obviously gets Norfolk State but still
look<00:02:59.340> pretty<00:02:59.430> good<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.819> then<00:02:59.909> I<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.599> feel

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
look pretty good and then I have to feel

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.000 
look pretty good and then I have to feel
like<00:03:00.900> they're<00:03:01.109> they're<00:03:01.530> playing<00:03:01.799> much<00:03:01.980> better

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
like they're they're playing much better

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.649 
like they're they're playing much better
now<00:03:02.400> than<00:03:02.700> they<00:03:02.849> did<00:03:02.879> earlier<00:03:03.359> in<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.510> season

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
now than they did earlier in the season

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.629 
now than they did earlier in the season
and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.200> think<00:03:04.409> this<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.530> probably<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:05.430> good

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
and I think this is probably a good

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.800 
and I think this is probably a good
opportunity<00:03:05.939> for<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.299> Rutgers<00:03:06.540> defense

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
opportunity for the Rutgers defense

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.089 
opportunity for the Rutgers defense
really<00:03:06.989> prove<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.620> they're<00:03:07.829> better<00:03:07.980> than

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
really prove that they're better than

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.190 
really prove that they're better than

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.720 
hope that this blows over and goes away
but<00:04:56.080> my<00:04:56.320> only<00:04:56.500> advice<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:57.220> professor

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
but my only advice that professor

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.400 
but my only advice that professor
Dowling<00:04:57.910> would<00:04:58.150> be<00:04:58.270> leave<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.870> writing<00:04:59.230> to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
Dowling would be leave the writing to

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.140 
Dowling would be leave the writing to
the<00:04:59.500> writers<00:04:59.830> because<00:05:00.070> obviously<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.880> can't

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
the writers because obviously you can't

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.640 
the writers because obviously you can't
do<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.510> my<00:05:01.780> advice<00:05:02.050> would<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.260> for<00:05:02.350> him<00:05:02.530> to

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
do that my advice would be for him to

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.230 
do that my advice would be for him to
just<00:05:02.710> go<00:05:02.920> away<00:05:03.010> but<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.910> that's<00:05:04.060> what<00:05:04.150> we're
