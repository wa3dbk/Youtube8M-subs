your chances of getting through in your
next<00:00:32.880> few<00:00:33.030> days<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.079> think<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.920> our

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
next few days so I think that our

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.940 
next few days so I think that our
chances<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.090> good<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.719> need<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.020> win

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
chances are really good we need to win

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
chances are really good we need to win
Volcan<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> maybe<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
Volcan and maybe if there will be

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
Volcan and maybe if there will be
tiebreaker<00:00:40.559> match<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.070> need<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> win

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
tiebreaker match we will need to win

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.660 
tiebreaker match we will need to win
also<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.670> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
also but I think that we can do it so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.010 
also but I think that we can do it so

have<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> counter<00:01:31.590> Ferrari<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> oreonna<00:01:32.750> well

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
have a counter Ferrari and oreonna well

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
have a counter Ferrari and oreonna well
I<00:01:33.900> guess<00:01:34.049> Ariana<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.009> strong

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
I guess Ariana I know it's not so strong

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
I guess Ariana I know it's not so strong
but<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.030> managed<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:37.200> find

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
but I managed to do find

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.030 
but I managed to do find
and<00:01:38.930> what<00:01:39.259> were<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.470> most<00:01:39.650> afraid<00:01:39.860> of

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and what were you most afraid of

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.149 
and what were you most afraid of
expected<00:01:40.579> playing<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:42.740> didn't<00:01:42.979> think<00:01:43.070> that

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
expected playing so we didn't think that

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.980 
expected playing so we didn't think that
he<00:01:43.340> played<00:01:43.549> fees<00:01:43.790> we<00:01:44.119> were<00:01:44.180> more<00:01:44.360> expecting

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
he played fees we were more expecting

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050 
he played fees we were more expecting
custody<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.430> would<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> bit<00:01:46.880> easier

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
custody so it would be a bit easier

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.120 
custody so it would be a bit easier
matchup<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.049> could<00:01:48.470> be<00:01:48.590> harder<00:01:48.920> even

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
matchup but it could be harder even

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.190 
matchup but it could be harder even
harder<00:01:49.549> in<00:01:49.700> game<00:01:49.939> because<00:01:50.630> Kassadin<00:01:51.110> is

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
harder in game because Kassadin is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.779 
harder in game because Kassadin is
really<00:01:51.439> strong<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.710> doesn't<00:01:52.070> forgive<00:01:52.580> any

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
really strong and doesn't forgive any

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.700 
really strong and doesn't forgive any
like<00:01:53.570> mistakes<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:56.630> loriana<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.470> really

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
like mistakes so but loriana is really

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.859 
like mistakes so but loriana is really
good<00:01:57.890> against<00:01:58.220> like<00:01:58.340> most<00:01:58.580> custody<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.659> fees

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
good against like most custody and fees

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.419 
good against like most custody and fees
on<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.259> lane<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:02.689> think<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.830> should<00:02:04.220> do

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
on the lane and I think that I should do

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.249 
on the lane and I think that I should do
like<00:02:04.460> less<00:02:05.270> mistakes<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.080> should

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
like less mistakes and we should

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.169 
like less mistakes and we should
pressure<00:02:06.530> him<00:02:06.830> more<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:07.189> me<00:02:07.340> because<00:02:07.820> he<00:02:08.090> was

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
pressure him more on me because he was

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.270 
pressure him more on me because he was
really<00:02:08.420> behind<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:09.440> didn't<00:02:09.709> do<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.979> so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
really behind but we didn't do it so

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.340 
really behind but we didn't do it so
after<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.269> first<00:02:11.390> kill<00:02:11.660> he<00:02:11.810> was<00:02:11.959> back<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
after the first kill he was back in the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.729 
after the first kill he was back in the
game<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:12.799> Zach<00:02:13.130> came<00:02:13.989> yeah<00:02:14.989> yeah<00:02:15.709> I

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
game and then Zach came yeah yeah I

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.289 
game and then Zach came yeah yeah I
think<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.190> at<00:02:16.340> first<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.640> was<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:16.910> scared

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
think so at first I was really scared

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.930 
think so at first I was really scared
because<00:02:17.420> he<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:17.989> almost<00:02:18.769> 40<00:02:19.130> CCS<00:02:19.640> ahead

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
because he was like almost 40 CCS ahead

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.850 
because he was like almost 40 CCS ahead
I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.450> he<00:02:20.900> was<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:21.200> ahead<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.410> was<00:02:21.620> like

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
I think he was so ahead I was like

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.830 
I think he was so ahead I was like
thinking<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.060> don't<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> kill

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
thinking if if I don't get to get a kill

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.539 
thinking if if I don't get to get a kill
soon<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.290> will<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.620> too<00:02:24.920> late<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.130> he<00:02:25.340> will

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
soon it will be too late and he will

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.750 
soon it will be too late and he will
just<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.030> key<00:02:26.150> level<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.110> yeah<00:02:27.760> diamond

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
just be on key level but yeah diamond

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.820 
just be on key level but yeah diamond

he left me for a while and that was my
chance<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.380> dive<00:02:33.590> he<00:02:33.799> won<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:34.250> get<00:02:34.430> punished

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
chance to dive he won not get punished

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
kill was definitely a turning point in

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:10.999

the<00:05:09.870> game<00:05:09.900> yeah<00:05:10.469> that's<00:05:10.650> pretty<00:05:10.770> much<00:05:10.860> what

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
the game yeah that's pretty much what

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.769 
the game yeah that's pretty much what
Saints<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.610> don't<00:05:12.089> think<00:05:12.240> what's<00:05:12.389> that<00:05:12.539> Keeley

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
Saints I don't think what's that Keeley

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.149 
Saints I don't think what's that Keeley
was<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.050> second<00:05:13.349> kill<00:05:13.529> what<00:05:13.680> says<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.889> month

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
was the second kill what says a month

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.519 
was the second kill what says a month
because<00:05:14.310> Akio<00:05:14.819> put<00:05:15.509> it<00:05:15.629> promote<00:05:16.229> equal

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
because Akio put it promote equal

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.800 
because Akio put it promote equal
because<00:05:17.189> the<00:05:17.430> firm<00:05:17.610> he<00:05:17.759> had<00:05:17.939> still<00:05:18.419> what's<00:05:18.719> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
because the firm he had still what's the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.360 
because the firm he had still what's the
single<00:05:18.990> probably<00:05:19.589> can't<00:05:19.740> even<00:05:19.800> more<00:05:20.069> gold<00:05:20.249> on

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
single probably can't even more gold on

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.790 
single probably can't even more gold on
me<00:05:20.550> well<00:05:21.240> then<00:05:21.539> sack<00:05:21.990> came<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.439> we<00:05:22.499> kill<00:05:22.680> him

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
me well then sack came and we kill him

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.230 
me well then sack came and we kill him
again<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.219> I<00:05:23.370> think<00:05:23.580> after<00:05:23.789> that<00:05:23.909> is<00:05:24.060> when<00:05:24.180> I

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
again and I think after that is when I

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.029 
again and I think after that is when I
was<00:05:24.389> ahead<00:05:24.569> of<00:05:24.719> him<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.080> he<00:05:25.589> couldn't<00:05:25.830> do<00:05:25.919> much

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
was ahead of him and he couldn't do much

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.300 
was ahead of him and he couldn't do much
anymore<00:05:27.020> alright<00:05:28.020> well<00:05:28.379> just<00:05:28.409> wrapping<00:05:29.009> up<00:05:29.099> we

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
anymore alright well just wrapping up we

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.159 
anymore alright well just wrapping up we
heard<00:05:29.490> dyrus<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:29.969> other<00:05:30.089> day<00:05:30.270> say<00:05:30.509> that<00:05:30.870> your

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
heard dyrus the other day say that your

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.409 
heard dyrus the other day say that your
group<00:05:31.409> is<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.009> significantly<00:05:32.789> weaker<00:05:33.150> group

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
group is the significantly weaker group

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.119 
group is the significantly weaker group
a<00:05:33.750> lot<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.139> people<00:05:34.229> are<00:05:34.500> gonna<00:05:34.589> hate<00:05:34.740> me<00:05:34.919> for

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
a lot of people are gonna hate me for

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.709 
a lot of people are gonna hate me for
this<00:05:35.219> but<00:05:35.279> I<00:05:35.460> feel<00:05:35.669> like<00:05:35.819> Kirby<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.330> at<00:05:36.569> least

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
this but I feel like Kirby is at least

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.850 
this but I feel like Kirby is at least
three<00:05:36.960> times<00:05:37.169> easier<00:05:37.589> in<00:05:37.680> group<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:39.710> could<00:05:40.710> you

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
three times easier in group a could you

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.619 
three times easier in group a could you
maybe<00:05:41.339> elaborate<00:05:41.909> because<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.210> just<00:05:42.389> hit<00:05:42.599> on

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
maybe elaborate because you just hit on

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.899 
maybe elaborate because you just hit on
ozone<00:05:43.080> but<00:05:43.289> is<00:05:43.649> there<00:05:43.860> any<00:05:44.279> other<00:05:44.370> team<00:05:44.699> you

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
ozone but is there any other team you

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.899 
ozone but is there any other team you
target<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:45.389> that<00:05:45.419> statement<00:05:45.990> or<00:05:46.909> everybody

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
target with that statement or everybody

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.240 
target with that statement or everybody
all<00:05:48.839> right<00:05:49.110> do<00:05:49.589> you<00:05:49.680> guys<00:05:49.830> agree<00:05:49.979> with<00:05:50.099> that

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
all right do you guys agree with that

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.499 
all right do you guys agree with that
and<00:05:50.610> do<00:05:50.909> you<00:05:50.969> think<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.330> would<00:05:51.449> have

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
and do you think that you would have

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.480 
and do you think that you would have
been<00:05:51.659> able<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.870> get<00:05:52.050> through<00:05:52.229> group<00:05:52.529> a

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
been able to get through group a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.430 
been able to get through group a
cannot<00:05:54.490> tell<00:05:54.700> but<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:54.970> think<00:05:55.240> yeah<00:05:55.600> like<00:05:55.960> it's

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
cannot tell but I think yeah like it's

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440 
cannot tell but I think yeah like it's
the<00:05:56.680> same<00:05:56.890> like<00:05:57.100> they<00:05:57.340> have<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.730> two<00:05:58.210> strong

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
the same like they have the two strong

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.020 
the same like they have the two strong
teams<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:59.380> attention<00:05:59.800> is<00:05:59.920> really<00:06:00.040> good<00:06:00.310> but<00:06:01.000> I

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
teams the attention is really good but I

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.720 
teams the attention is really good but I
saw<00:06:01.300> them<00:06:01.450> like<00:06:01.660> they<00:06:01.900> always<00:06:02.140> had<00:06:02.520> some<00:06:03.520> weird

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
saw them like they always had some weird

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.370 
saw them like they always had some weird
mistakes<00:06:04.210> they<00:06:04.360> were<00:06:04.420> doing<00:06:04.870> some<00:06:05.200> one<00:06:05.290> of

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
mistakes they were doing some one of

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.840 
mistakes they were doing some one of
them<00:06:05.530> was<00:06:05.650> always<00:06:05.830> doing<00:06:06.040> some<00:06:06.250> weird<00:06:06.400> stuff<00:06:06.670> I

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
them was always doing some weird stuff I

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.640 
them was always doing some weird stuff I
don't<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.780> feels<00:06:08.020> like<00:06:08.290> they<00:06:08.380> were<00:06:08.500> not

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
don't know it feels like they were not

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.750 
don't know it feels like they were not
playing<00:06:08.800> like<00:06:09.010> a<00:06:09.130> school<00:06:09.340> that<00:06:09.430> they<00:06:09.550> should

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
playing like a school that they should

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.290 
playing like a school that they should
but<00:06:10.540> yeah<00:06:10.690> oMG<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:11.640> think<00:06:12.640> maybe<00:06:12.790> we<00:06:13.060> could<00:06:13.180> have

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
but yeah oMG I think maybe we could have

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.580 
but yeah oMG I think maybe we could have
beat<00:06:13.480> them<00:06:13.660> actually<00:06:14.050> because<00:06:14.200> when<00:06:14.470> we

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
beat them actually because when we

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.830 
beat them actually because when we
practice<00:06:14.980> them<00:06:15.160> their<00:06:15.730> playstyle<00:06:16.450> is<00:06:16.630> not

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
practice them their playstyle is not

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.290 
practice them their playstyle is not
that<00:06:17.080> great<00:06:17.230> versus<00:06:17.650> us<00:06:17.830> it's<00:06:18.070> good<00:06:18.280> when<00:06:18.460> when

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
that great versus us it's good when when

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.690 
that great versus us it's good when when
they<00:06:19.420> have<00:06:19.680> 13<00:06:20.680> heroes<00:06:20.950> but<00:06:21.100> if<00:06:21.220> they<00:06:21.370> don't<00:06:21.580> I

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
they have 13 heroes but if they don't I

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.940 
they have 13 heroes but if they don't I
think<00:06:21.730> we<00:06:22.240> beat<00:06:22.480> him<00:06:22.690> almost<00:06:23.020> always<00:06:23.230> so<00:06:23.920> I

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
think we beat him almost always so I

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.560 
think we beat him almost always so I
think<00:06:24.040> we'll<00:06:24.280> have<00:06:24.400> managed<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.700> and<00:06:25.240> SK

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
think we'll have managed to and SK

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.880 
think we'll have managed to and SK
Telecom<00:06:26.020> I<00:06:26.170> don't<00:06:26.350> know<00:06:26.410> they<00:06:26.530> have<00:06:26.650> faker

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
Telecom I don't know they have faker

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.040 
Telecom I don't know they have faker
like<00:06:27.250> that<00:06:27.460> guy's<00:06:27.640> gone<00:06:27.940> no<00:06:28.300> way<00:06:28.450> I<00:06:28.480> could<00:06:28.900> do

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
like that guy's gone no way I could do

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.590 
like that guy's gone no way I could do
them<00:06:29.250> close<00:06:30.250> to<00:06:30.400> here<00:06:30.550> or<00:06:30.670> something<00:06:31.060> probably

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
them close to here or something probably

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
them close to here or something probably
he<00:06:31.660> would<00:06:31.750> think<00:06:31.960> he<00:06:32.170> will<00:06:32.290> win<00:06:32.410> the<00:06:32.440> game

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
he would think he will win the game

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.200 
he would think he will win the game
alone<00:06:32.860> so<00:06:33.010> yeah<00:06:33.220> I<00:06:33.250> will<00:06:33.340> have<00:06:33.400> kept<00:06:33.760> 2nd<00:06:34.030> place

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
alone so yeah I will have kept 2nd place

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.480 
alone so yeah I will have kept 2nd place
or<00:06:34.360> something<00:06:34.510> and<00:06:35.380> do<00:06:35.980> you<00:06:36.040> agree<00:06:36.130> do<00:06:36.340> you

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
or something and do you agree do you

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.820 
or something and do you agree do you
think<00:06:36.640> that<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.900> other<00:06:37.930> group<00:06:38.290> is<00:06:38.440> stronger

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
think that the other group is stronger

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.500 
think that the other group is stronger
or<00:06:38.860> that<00:06:39.250> you<00:06:39.700> would<00:06:39.790> have<00:06:39.880> had<00:06:40.120> more<00:06:40.300> success

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
or that you would have had more success

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.350 
or that you would have had more success
or<00:06:40.870> less<00:06:40.990> success<00:06:41.320> in<00:06:41.440> that<00:06:41.530> group

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
or less success in that group

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.410 
or less success in that group
I<00:06:42.390> know<00:06:43.170> it's<00:06:43.350> not<00:06:43.440> about<00:06:43.560> that<00:06:44.040> but<00:06:44.190> like<00:06:44.420> I

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
I know it's not about that but like I

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.090 
I know it's not about that but like I
don't<00:06:45.840> think<00:06:46.080> that<00:06:46.200> DSM<00:06:46.650> would<00:06:46.770> have<00:06:46.920> more

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
don't think that DSM would have more

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.230 
don't think that DSM would have more
success<00:06:47.250> in<00:06:47.550> our<00:06:47.670> group<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:48.750> it's<00:06:49.590> about<00:06:49.860> like

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
success in our group so it's about like

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.760 
success in our group so it's about like
we<00:06:51.240> got<00:06:51.390> like<00:06:51.570> two<00:06:51.870> three<00:06:52.080> good<00:06:52.320> teams<00:06:52.560> they

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
we got like two three good teams they

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.370 
we got like two three good teams they
got<00:06:52.920> like<00:06:53.130> two<00:06:53.340> or<00:06:53.400> three<00:06:53.460> good<00:06:53.760> teams<00:06:54.000> and

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
got like two or three good teams and

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.960 
got like two or three good teams and
lemondogs<00:06:55.380> is<00:06:55.620> underperforming<00:06:55.980> hard<00:06:56.550> let's

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
lemondogs is underperforming hard let's

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.600 
lemondogs is underperforming hard let's
see<00:06:57.180> like<00:06:57.330> I<00:06:57.570> wouldn't<00:06:58.560> count<00:06:58.680> them<00:06:58.950> out<00:06:59.100> like

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
see like I wouldn't count them out like

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.220 
see like I wouldn't count them out like
before<00:06:59.910> then<00:07:00.120> I<00:07:00.240> saw<00:07:00.450> but<00:07:00.750> like<00:07:01.080> even

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
before then I saw but like even

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.810 
before then I saw but like even
screaming<00:07:01.680> them<00:07:01.800> like<00:07:02.280> they<00:07:02.430> played<00:07:02.640> much

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
screaming them like they played much

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.190 
screaming them like they played much
better<00:07:03.060> in<00:07:03.210> Europe<00:07:03.540> then<00:07:03.690> they<00:07:03.900> are<00:07:03.990> playing

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
better in Europe then they are playing

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.170 
better in Europe then they are playing
here<00:07:04.500> and<00:07:04.800> you<00:07:05.160> don't<00:07:05.280> know<00:07:05.400> the<00:07:05.610> reason<00:07:05.760> if

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
here and you don't know the reason if

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.670 
here and you don't know the reason if
it's<00:07:06.360> deadlock<00:07:06.780> or<00:07:06.990> nerves<00:07:07.260> or<00:07:07.560> something

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
it's deadlock or nerves or something

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.950 
it's deadlock or nerves or something
else<00:07:08.040> or<00:07:08.280> they're<00:07:08.670> just<00:07:08.730> depressed<00:07:09.270> after<00:07:09.840> the

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
else or they're just depressed after the

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.290 
else or they're just depressed after the
first<00:07:10.170> losses<00:07:10.560> and<00:07:10.770> then<00:07:10.920> gets<00:07:11.670> on<00:07:11.820> like<00:07:12.090> two

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
first losses and then gets on like two

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.010 
first losses and then gets on like two
so<00:07:13.110> I<00:07:13.880> think<00:07:14.880> that<00:07:15.000> actually<00:07:15.150> we<00:07:15.570> could<00:07:15.870> get

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
so I think that actually we could get

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.960 
so I think that actually we could get
out<00:07:16.200> of<00:07:16.380> group<00:07:16.620> at<00:07:16.860> least<00:07:17.070> try<00:07:17.250> on<00:07:17.610> second

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
out of group at least try on second

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.910 
out of group at least try on second
place<00:07:18.060> but<00:07:18.420> still<00:07:18.720> like<00:07:18.870> they<00:07:19.290> got<00:07:19.440> on<00:07:19.560> G<00:07:19.890> and

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 
place but still like they got on G and

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.390 
place but still like they got on G and
SKT<00:07:20.430> so<00:07:20.900> close<00:07:21.900> I<00:07:22.170> think<00:07:23.100> the<00:07:23.190> only<00:07:23.310> difference

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
SKT so close I think the only difference

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.970 
SKT so close I think the only difference
is<00:07:23.970> why<00:07:24.480> this<00:07:24.540> group<00:07:24.930> might<00:07:25.410> be<00:07:25.440> a<00:07:25.650> bit<00:07:25.860> easier

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
is why this group might be a bit easier

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.010 
is why this group might be a bit easier
is<00:07:26.670> because<00:07:26.730> MVP<00:07:27.420> ozone<00:07:27.450> is<00:07:27.810> kind

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
is because MVP ozone is kind

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.040 
is because MVP ozone is kind
underperforming<00:07:28.710> as<00:07:28.800> well<00:07:29.010> so<00:07:29.730> if<00:07:30.450> I'm<00:07:30.630> BP<00:07:30.900> was

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
underperforming as well so if I'm BP was

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.390 
underperforming as well so if I'm BP was
playing<00:07:31.290> us<00:07:31.380> their<00:07:31.560> usual<00:07:31.800> level<00:07:32.070> I<00:07:32.130> think<00:07:32.310> it

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
playing us their usual level I think it

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.610 
playing us their usual level I think it
will<00:07:32.460> be<00:07:32.580> exactly<00:07:32.820> the<00:07:33.060> same<00:07:33.090> tool<00:07:33.780> or<00:07:34.140> choose

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 
will be exactly the same tool or choose

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.920 
will be exactly the same tool or choose
really<00:07:34.800> strong<00:07:35.070> teams<00:07:35.310> to<00:07:36.240> really<00:07:36.720> really

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
really strong teams to really really

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.050 
really strong teams to really really
strong<00:07:37.140> teens<00:07:37.320> as<00:07:37.470> well<00:07:37.500> and<00:07:37.830> it<00:07:38.640> will<00:07:38.790> be<00:07:38.910> kind

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
strong teens as well and it will be kind

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.460 
strong teens as well and it will be kind
of<00:07:39.210> the<00:07:39.270> same<00:07:39.450> I<00:07:39.480> think<00:07:39.810> so<00:07:39.930> we<00:07:40.050> counted<00:07:40.350> out

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470 
of the same I think so we counted out

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.950 
of the same I think so we counted out
game<00:07:40.770> it's<00:07:40.950> like<00:07:41.040> no<00:07:41.310> strong<00:07:41.580> team<00:07:41.820> I<00:07:41.960> said

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 
game it's like no strong team I said

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.710 
game it's like no strong team I said
really<00:07:43.110> really<00:07:43.230> strong<00:07:43.650> teams<00:07:44.390> you<00:07:45.390> are<00:07:45.570> a

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.330 
really really strong teams you are a
strong<00:07:45.960> I<00:07:46.140> said<00:07:46.410> two<00:07:46.620> really<00:07:46.860> strong<00:07:46.920> teams

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
strong I said two really strong teams

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.160 
strong I said two really strong teams
