00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.430
 sing and count the necessary games 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.349
 so that our students advance in the 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.260
 knowledge of the number that we 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.540
 we are referring on this occasion 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.070
 what happens is that traditionally in 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.410
 the nursery classrooms we have 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.990
 dedicated more time to the number like 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.210
 name and symbol to the associated number 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.100
 an amount this time I do not want 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.170
 show four of the games we have 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.510
 prepared on wwe.com to work this 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.000
 concept is to say the number as 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.800
 cardinal associated with a collection in the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.390
 series is called I see that one the first 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.210
 what I'm going to show is this the finger with 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.090
 finger that 1 bunch and that hand our 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.239
 cute monkey characters with an eye and that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.590
 hand they will teach us how to count and associate the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.810
 number to an amount 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 the structure is always the same 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.220
 nice character for them in this 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.480
 case mono jo goes out and goes 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.580
 appearing at the same time as on the screen 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.890
 change the number as the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.430
 amount changes the number that is associated 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.430
 to that amount 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.670
 on this screen they would count up to 99 mono 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 jojoy will go out progressively to the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.320
 time they leave time for 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.470
 our students can count 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.290
 and you realize up here we have the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.240
 English and Spanish version by 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.590
 that of bilingual schools and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.450
 want to work this activity in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.440
 English can also do it and it 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.010
 can download for mobile 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.310
 well I'll show you how like that hand 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.840
 it also presents the same structure going 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.350
 leaving that hand associated with that number 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.350
 two 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.820
 as you can see in this same application 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.009
 we have games to learn other things 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.750
 but as in this case at this time 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.700
 what we are dedicating it to 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.710
 name and symbol and to the recitation of the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.550
 America series I want to show you 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.129
 part that is dedicated to that as I said the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.519
 games are four of the series of 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:18.330
 touches 1 are 4 here we have another in which 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.430
 with another our different environment 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 the animals also appear 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.340
 leaving associated with the amount 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 in this case they are chicks we have 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.930
 put music because they tend to like it 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 relaxes and makes them focus more 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.670
 if you want to remove the selectivity there 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.760
 the music is removed but it keeps coming out 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.950
 Sound 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.950
 well this would be with this chick 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.680
 You can also use this other type of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.140
 chicks too and the structure is the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.700
 the number is always coming out 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.790
 associated with a quantity of the number 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.250
 associated an amount 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.519
 two other nice games that we have 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.620
 ready to work the recitation of 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.010
 the number series and associated to a 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.280
 amount are these also because 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.280
 one 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.900
 there are butterflies and spiders here 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.640
 this would be the butterflies 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.520
 in this for example a bee comes out 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.280
 riding 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.540
 it goes out every time a bee is counted 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.540
 other than a new bee 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.350
 as you see gives enough time for 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.330
 that children can think about 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.180
 anticipate the next number 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 recite the number series can 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.030
 interact with your classmates when you go 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.500
 coming out 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.080
 this one also has the butterflies and the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.319
 of bees and finally I want to show 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.690
 this here that is the one of fish and spiders 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.680
 a nice game in which the spider goes 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.680
 going down from the roof 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.250
 pass as before if you want to remove the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.250
 music you can 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.639
 to make these games we 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.069
 based on the theory that that child is 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.139
 able to recognize the number as 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.940
 cardinal of a collection however not 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.889
 is able to represent the name scene 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.870
 and symbol of it because because its 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.610
 motor maturity I just do not know 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.380
 allows for how old you have this is 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.509
 very typical when they are three years old 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.949
 child may be able to recognize the 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.720
 number four and associate it with the 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.660
 amount that represents but may not 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.430
 know how to draw it and then we do not 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.960
 we have to stop in the advance 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.270
 of the knowledge of the number of our 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.650
 students but we have to be able 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.060
 to see what it is that our 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.009
 students can do and what is that 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.440
 that they can not do in this case the 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.250
 graphic representation of the number maybe 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.250
 is later
