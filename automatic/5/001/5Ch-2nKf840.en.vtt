00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello friends and welcome to car 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.799
 champions today we're going to talk about a topic 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.209
 important the motorhomes and children 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.170
 since there are many families 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:16.420
 interested in this type of vehicle and 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.330
 in this type of tourism that is done with 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.130
 this type of vehicle and we are going to do it 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.560
 live and live visiting a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 motorhome that is designed to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.269
 travel with children with formen we have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 opposite we have the typical dining room 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.640
 makes bed 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.860
 common of many motorhomes in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080
 back 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 we have a bunk in this case is a 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 large bunk and on top 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.760
 we have this big bed our bed 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.200
 matrimonial that makes meter 40 x 2 meters 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.450
 Wide 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.760
 practically being able to me including two 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.180
 adults and one more child because it's a bed 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.740
 very big 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.940
 well one of the things that most interests 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.800
 families is the subject of safety 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.229
 everyone when they start looking 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.910
 motorhome wonders good but what 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.090
 security we have in such a vehicle 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.550
 small and reaches as many things as 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.950
 example kitchen fridge heating bathroom 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.970
 shower hot water but finally at the end 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 the motorhome is a small house 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.560
 let's start with the kitchen for example this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.680
 kitchen there are kitchens with 234 stoves this 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.750
 It is a kitchen with four stoves when 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.290
 we put the kitchen to work 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.149
 we always have to press the button 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.119
 all the motorhomes that they have 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.940
 piezoelectric or the button is not pressed 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 and this is a way of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.420
 make sure that even if the child gets by 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.550
 here if you accidentally touch the button 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.370
 yes yes do not squeeze the gas will not come out and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.360
 although squeeze has to be that squeeze 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.220
 followed by this button if we do not 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560
 talks about gas so it's the last 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.110
 security system that applies 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.110
 also in the houses but 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 in the case of complaint 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.769
 We have interrupted the passage of gas 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.830
 here all the motorhomes share 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.840
 this type of buttons that are gas passage 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.080
 we have two ways to interrupt the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.700
 gas step one is typical through 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.890
 the cylinder that blocked the passage of the gas 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.890
 for the bottle and here we have 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.660
 you see these red buttons that if you 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.360
 we rotated we interrupted the gas passage and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.540
 we do not have to go outside and then 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.180
 we will not have gas passage 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.659
 in certain devices here we have four 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.170
 buttons because one is the gas passage 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.640
 that goes to the kitchen the other is the step of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.590
 gas that goes to the hot water the boiler 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.650
 another to the refrigerator and the other 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.080
 to the stove if for example at night only 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.030
 we use the stove because nothing we leave 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.069
 open the gas passage of the stove 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 we turn it off 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.780
 as you can well and imagine the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.610
 motorhome is designed this kind of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.520
 motorhomes 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.830
 every time you think more about children and their 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.520
 security for example in the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.930
 modern motorhomes already carry this 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.610
 type of network that hangs and then if 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.060
 a little boy sleeps in the part of 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.209
 up can not fall down 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.660
 there are even safety nets in the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.480
 camera here we have one in this kind of 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.150
 bed in the mansard in the part of 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.069
 up because there are many children who 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.040
 he likes to sleep like this is up makes him 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.500
 grace then so that they do not fall 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.200
 many houses have included this type of 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.569
 network that can be bought anyway 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.959
 separately and put in a 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:19.109
 motorhome that does not have them as you see 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:23.260
 all the edges all the doors are 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.900
 rounded up that is there is no way that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 someone is hurt and some 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.460
 quality little details 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 every time they are doing things 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 top 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.759
 for example the bathrooms are all the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.740
 toxic anti plastic material 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.050
 naturally and that resists heat and 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.150
 cold 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.610
 the toilet is completely in plastic 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.420
 whereby children are difficult to be 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.030
 hurt 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.030
 at the controls of showers and old 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.580
 here of washbasin is located in the part 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.340
 high camping 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.980
 there is enough aeration 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.010
 we have buoys face we have windows 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.380
 we have windows everywhere that is 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.949
 open we have mosquito nets and darkens 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.460
 in all the windows then 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.460
 we have 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.240
 way that bugs do not enter and we 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.069
 pique 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.400
 here we are seeing a pretty vehicle 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.560
 modern is about 8 years old and we see the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.160
 belts 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.210
 three points and here there are also other 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.400
 belts what they watch from behind 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.919
 from front to back the squares of 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.760
 this on this side have belts of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.990
 two points because when the vehicle 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.529
 brake 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.679
 here we have 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:50.270
 where to support the head why not 

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:53.090
 we will have no harm 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.790
 in case of a sudden braking the 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.000
 television is always located above 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.729
 on the top 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.740
 and good 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:08.080
 here in this vehicle we see some 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.599
 small details more for example here 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.029
 we have the electric controls here a 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.089
 Little boy can not always get there 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.129
 they are usually located in the good part 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.699
 at a pretty important height and 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.699
 considerable 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.999
 here 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.909
 you see how we have a point where 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:31.669
 support us to download and another detail of 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:35.119
 quality and fame measured by 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:38.299
 the builders is to put a covers 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:41.300
 rung ladder that is pure and believe your 

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:44.900
 system to cover 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.419
 to cover the stairs so that if 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.920
 we are inside by the closed door no 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.600
 we fall in the hole 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.090
 in this case in this type of 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.990
 motorhome for example we have 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.270
 mosquito nets 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.639
 at the entrance 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:04.330
 in travel 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:07.870
 This type of vehicle is very nice 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:13.120
 travel with him because we first have a 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.819
 space greater then we have a volume 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.400
 greater so if we need to stop 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.919
 urgently because we have to go to 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.830
 bathroom is very simple for one side of the 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:27.780
 road and for example go to the bathroom or 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:32.090
 cook to take a nap and so on 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.090
 in order that is a first part d 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:36.490
 the topic about the motorhomes their 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.569
 security and we will continue to talk more 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.569
 go ahead on this
