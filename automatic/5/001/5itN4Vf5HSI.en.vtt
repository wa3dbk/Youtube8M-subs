understanding<00:00:46.330> bronchiolitis<00:00:47.080> I<00:00:47.560> will<00:00:48.070> go

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
understanding bronchiolitis I will go

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.490 
understanding bronchiolitis I will go
into<00:00:48.310> a<00:00:48.430> lot<00:00:48.700> more<00:00:48.910> detail<00:00:49.270> now<00:00:49.510> about<00:00:50.260> the

into a lot more detail now about the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950 
into a lot more detail now about the
treatment<00:00:50.950> of<00:00:51.250> bronchiolitis<00:00:51.880> so<00:00:52.570> if<00:00:52.720> you're

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
treatment of bronchiolitis so if you're

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.890 
treatment of bronchiolitis so if you're
ready<00:00:53.110> let's<00:00:53.580> get<00:00:54.580> started<00:00:54.640> with<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.270> dose<00:00:55.600> of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
ready let's get started with a dose of

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.140 
ready let's get started with a dose of
medical<00:00:56.730> inspiration<00:00:58.290> so<00:00:59.290> if<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.400> diagnosis

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
medical inspiration so if the diagnosis

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.110 
medical inspiration so if the diagnosis
of<00:01:01.300> bronchiolitis<00:01:02.080> is<00:01:02.470> made<00:01:02.830> what<00:01:03.580> will<00:01:03.880> be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
of bronchiolitis is made what will be

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.109 
of bronchiolitis is made what will be
done<00:01:04.360> now<00:01:05.320> sometimes<00:01:05.740> no<00:01:06.460> treatment<00:01:07.000> is

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
done now sometimes no treatment is

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.420 
done now sometimes no treatment is
necessary<00:01:07.330> if<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.050> infant<00:01:08.440> is<00:01:08.590> stable<00:01:09.130> he<00:01:09.369> or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
she will be treated with supportive care

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.430 
she will be treated with supportive care
just<00:01:12.130> as<00:01:12.340> though<00:01:12.610> they<00:01:12.850> have<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.270> cold<00:01:13.600> maybe<00:01:14.350> a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
just as though they have a cold maybe a

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.980 
just as though they have a cold maybe a
little<00:01:14.470> tylenol<00:01:15.160> some<00:01:15.729> extra<00:01:16.090> fluids<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
little tylenol some extra fluids and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.380 
little tylenol some extra fluids and
just<00:01:17.560> some<00:01:17.710> TLC<00:01:18.010> for<00:01:18.430> mommy<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.940> going<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.210> work

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
just some TLC for mommy is going to work

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.160 
just some TLC for mommy is going to work
wonders<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:21.070> sometimes<00:01:21.509> further<00:01:22.509> supportive

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
wonders but sometimes further supportive

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.830 
wonders but sometimes further supportive
therapy<00:01:23.619> may<00:01:24.160> help<00:01:24.190> as<00:01:24.759> well<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.450> these<00:01:25.660> are

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
therapy may help as well so these are

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.060 
therapy may help as well so these are
things<00:01:26.080> like<00:01:26.200> chess<00:01:26.650> clapping<00:01:27.220> clear<00:01:28.119> fluids

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
things like chess clapping clear fluids

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630 
things like chess clapping clear fluids
humidified<00:01:30.070> air<00:01:30.430> or<00:01:31.090> oxygen<00:01:32.190> just<00:01:33.190> coupled

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
humidified air or oxygen just coupled

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.820 
humidified air or oxygen just coupled
with<00:01:33.759> getting<00:01:34.360> extra<00:01:34.810> rest<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.320> next<00:01:35.530> few

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
with getting extra rest for the next few

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.830 
with getting extra rest for the next few
days<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:38.229> now<00:01:38.680> know<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.840> bronchiolitis

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
days now you now know that bronchiolitis

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.450 
days now you now know that bronchiolitis
is<00:01:41.170> caused<00:01:41.470> by<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> number<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.040> different

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
is caused by a number of different

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.110 
is caused by a number of different
viruses<00:01:42.970> yes<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:44.200> also<00:01:44.440> know<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
viruses yes and you also know that

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.510 
viruses yes and you also know that
antibiotics<00:01:46.120> are<00:01:46.300> for<00:01:46.830> bacterial<00:01:47.830> infections

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
antibiotics are for bacterial infections

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.060 
antibiotics are for bacterial infections
so<00:01:49.090> antibiotics<00:01:49.840> are<00:01:49.990> not<00:01:50.020> effective<00:01:50.740> at<00:01:50.860> all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
so antibiotics are not effective at all

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.820 
so antibiotics are not effective at all
against<00:01:51.580> viral<00:01:51.880> infections<00:01:52.830> antibiotics

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
against viral infections antibiotics

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.450 
against viral infections antibiotics
