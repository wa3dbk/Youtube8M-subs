00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
door those are Alpine that light if you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.980 
door those are Alpine that light if you
have<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.000> door<00:03:34.150> open<00:03:34.420> will<00:03:34.540> stay<00:03:34.690> on<00:03:34.780> all<00:03:34.870> the

have the door open will stay on all the
time<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.940> from<00:03:37.300> there<00:03:37.570> it's<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.680> reverse

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
time but from there it's just reverse

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.140 
time but from there it's just reverse
your<00:03:39.370> steps<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.080> goes<00:03:41.290> back<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.710> same

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
your steps it all goes back the same

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.890 
your steps it all goes back the same
both<00:03:43.150> doors<00:03:43.450> are<00:03:43.660> exactly<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.200> same<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:46.570> would

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
both doors are exactly the same I would

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.210 
both doors are exactly the same I would
suggest<00:03:47.020> not<00:03:47.290> using<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:47.890> these<00:03:48.310> are<00:03:48.490> stupid

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
suggest not using this these are stupid

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.240 
suggest not using this these are stupid
this<00:03:51.220> straight<00:03:52.060> much<00:03:52.390> better

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
this straight much better

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.870 
this straight much better
you<00:03:54.250> will<00:03:54.430> need<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.850> for<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:56.350> locking

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
you will need that for the locking

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.970 
you will need that for the locking
mechanism<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.120> other<00:03:58.330> than<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.920> is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
mechanism but other than that it is

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.970 
mechanism but other than that it is
fairly<00:04:00.400> simple<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.850> do<00:04:00.970> all<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.980> like

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
fairly simple to do all that like

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.010 
fairly simple to do all that like

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
I'm not able to do but it's pretty much

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.629 
I'm not able to do but it's pretty much
get<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.419> hooks<00:05:04.629> and<00:05:04.780> everything<00:05:05.080> lined<00:05:05.259> up

get the hooks and everything lined up

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.860 
get the hooks and everything lined up
it'll<00:05:06.639> be<00:05:06.669> set<00:05:06.909> on<00:05:06.940> like<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.360> it'll<00:05:07.629> beat<00:05:07.750> up

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
it'll be set on like that it'll beat up

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.689 
it'll be set on like that it'll beat up
and<00:05:08.050> then<00:05:08.139> you<00:05:08.229> just<00:05:08.259> push<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.740> down<00:05:08.889> and<00:05:09.550> you

and then you just push it down and you

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.580 
and then you just push it down and you
but<00:05:10.060> make<00:05:10.210> sure<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.479> have<00:05:10.629> this<00:05:11.259> corner

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
but make sure you have this corner

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.439 
but make sure you have this corner
pushed<00:05:11.830> in<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.159> this<00:05:12.789> corner<00:05:13.090> kind<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.330> use

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
pushed in and this corner kind of use

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.510 
pushed in and this corner kind of use
your<00:05:13.569> whole<00:05:13.720> arm<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.800> press<00:05:15.039> right<00:05:15.190> here<00:05:15.250> and

your whole arm to press right here and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.589 
your whole arm to press right here and
then<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.699> just<00:05:15.729> push<00:05:15.970> down<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.449> thing

then you just push down and this thing

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.960 
then you just push down and this thing
goes<00:05:16.720> click<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.710> you'll<00:05:17.830> hear<00:05:18.099> it<00:05:18.220> snap<00:05:18.639> into

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
goes click and you'll hear it snap into

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.180 
goes click and you'll hear it snap into
place<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:21.629> if<00:05:22.629> anything<00:05:23.470> jiggles<00:05:23.979> like<00:05:24.039> if

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
place and if anything jiggles like if

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.020 
place and if anything jiggles like if
you<00:05:24.280> pull<00:05:24.490> over<00:05:24.610> here

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
you pull over here

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.700 
you pull over here
pull<00:05:25.240> over<00:05:25.270> here<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.629> it<00:05:25.690> jiggles<00:05:26.020> one<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.650> the

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
pull over here and it jiggles one of the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.559 
pull over here and it jiggles one of the
hooks<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.979> most<00:05:27.190> likely<00:05:27.340> not<00:05:27.520> in<00:05:27.729> other<00:05:28.360> than

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
hooks is most likely not in other than

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.240 
hooks is most likely not in other than
that<00:05:28.720> if<00:05:28.900> it's<00:05:29.080> all<00:05:29.199> sturdy<00:05:29.500> it's<00:05:29.889> going<00:05:30.069> to<00:05:30.130> be

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
that if it's all sturdy it's going to be

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.120 
that if it's all sturdy it's going to be
