00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
keeping up with the injects because it's

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.430

then you just fall behind with

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.300 
then you just fall behind with
production<00:06:15.700> if<00:06:16.150> if<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.050> Protoss<00:06:17.560> has<00:06:17.860> 9

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.430 
production if if the Protoss has 9
gateways<00:06:18.850> and<00:06:19.120> you're<00:06:19.660> not<00:06:19.780> injecting<00:06:20.140> you're

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
gateways and you're not injecting you're

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.490 
gateways and you're not injecting you're
going<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.620> fall<00:06:20.770> behind<00:06:21.660> for<00:06:22.660> reinforcing<00:06:23.230> or

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
going to fall behind for reinforcing or

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.499 
going to fall behind for reinforcing or
whatever<00:06:23.970> what<00:06:24.970> have<00:06:25.000> you

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.999 

so<00:06:28.509> that's<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.169> only<00:06:29.380> problem<00:06:29.740> with<00:06:29.889> this

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
so that's it the only problem with this

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.219 
so that's it the only problem with this
way<00:06:30.220> of<00:06:30.370> doing<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.699> is<00:06:30.850> if<00:06:31.030> you<00:06:31.180> happen<00:06:31.570> to<00:06:31.600> get

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
way of doing it is if you happen to get

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.159 
way of doing it is if you happen to get
attacked<00:06:32.590> with<00:06:33.389> void<00:06:34.389> rays<00:06:34.660> or<00:06:34.810> something<00:06:35.110> you

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
attacked with void rays or something you

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.290 
attacked with void rays or something you
