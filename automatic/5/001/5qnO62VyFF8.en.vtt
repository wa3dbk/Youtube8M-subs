air oops there was smoke at about 3 or 4
minutes<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> opened<00:02:35.570> up<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.810> combustion

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
minutes in so I opened up the combustion

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.070 
minutes in so I opened up the combustion
air<00:02:36.560> some<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.730> three<00:02:38.060> minutes<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.540> system

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
had recovered it needed more combustion

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.040 
had recovered it needed more combustion

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.809 
when I first set the pot it is beginning
to<00:03:21.830> boil<00:03:22.240> yes<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.450> nice<00:03:23.840> rolling<00:03:24.470> boil<00:03:24.920> here<00:03:25.640> I'm

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
to boil yes a nice rolling boil here I'm

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.640 
to boil yes a nice rolling boil here I'm
testing<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.390> new<00:03:26.600> D<00:03:26.900> foaming<00:03:27.470> method<00:03:28.990> at<00:03:29.990> about

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
testing a new D foaming method at about

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.949 
testing a new D foaming method at about
the<00:03:30.800> time<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.190> beans<00:03:31.400> came<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> boil<00:03:32.390> the

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the time the beans came to a boil the

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.740 
the time the beans came to a boil the
bamboo<00:03:33.470> has<00:03:33.709> gasified<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.490> charcoal<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.720> I

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
bamboo has gasified the charcoal so I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.720 
bamboo has gasified the charcoal so I
switched<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.560> char<00:03:36.830> burning<00:03:37.190> phase<00:03:37.430> by

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
switched to the char burning phase by

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.400 
switched to the char burning phase by
closing<00:03:38.030> off<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.480> combustion<00:03:38.870> air<00:03:39.200> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
closing off the combustion air and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.710 
closing off the combustion air and

flow a little air is led through the
system<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> burn<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.319> charcoal<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
system to burn the charcoal and to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.690 
system to burn the charcoal and to
exhaust<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.940> steam<00:03:47.680> if<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.830> let<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.160> pot<00:03:49.430> boil

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
exhaust the steam if I let this pot boil

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.050 
exhaust the steam if I let this pot boil
over<00:03:50.030> twice<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.630> really<00:03:51.170> look<00:03:51.320> stupid<00:03:52.060> there's

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
over twice I really look stupid there's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.850 
over twice I really look stupid there's
a<00:03:53.150> little<00:03:53.450> too<00:03:53.540> much<00:03:53.570> steam<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.410> bled<00:03:54.709> off

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
a little too much steam so I bled off

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.370 
a little too much steam so I bled off
some<00:03:55.100> heat<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.730> only<00:03:55.970> took<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.600> few<00:03:56.630> seconds

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
some heat it only took a few seconds

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.590 
some heat it only took a few seconds
that<00:03:57.860> did<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:59.530> it<00:04:00.530> maintained<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.610> low<00:04:01.940> boil<00:04:02.209> for

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
that did it it maintained a low boil for

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.640 
that did it it maintained a low boil for
about<00:04:02.690> 30<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.380> 45<00:04:03.950> minutes<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:05.500> after<00:04:06.500> the

about 30 to 45 minutes and after the

about 30 to 45 minutes and after the
charcoal<00:04:07.220> was<00:04:07.430> gone

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
charcoal was gone

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.710 
charcoal was gone
I<00:04:08.530> removed<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> burner<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.280> count<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.450> pot

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
I removed the burner and count the pot

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.060 
I removed the burner and count the pot
module<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:13.190> retain<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:14.000> heat<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:15.739> was<00:04:16.040> a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
module to retain the heat it was a

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.220 
module to retain the heat it was a
little<00:04:16.340> windy<00:04:16.519> so<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> tossed<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.720> blanket<00:04:18.079> over

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
little windy so I tossed a blanket over

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.020 
little windy so I tossed a blanket over
the<00:04:18.470> pot<00:04:18.680> module<00:04:20.410> two<00:04:21.410> hours<00:04:21.769> later<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.880> was

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
the pot module two hours later it was

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.550 
the pot module two hours later it was
time<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.300> check<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.810> results

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
time to check the results

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:34.050 
time to check the results
I<00:04:28.000> saw<00:04:29.000> vapors<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.780> was<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.229> good<00:04:30.530> sign

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.370 

there<00:04:35.060> was<00:04:35.270> no<00:04:35.510> sticking<00:04:35.900> or<00:04:36.200> scorching<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
there was no sticking or scorching the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.030 
there was no sticking or scorching the
veins<00:04:39.380> were<00:04:39.590> soft<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.340> some<00:04:40.580> had<00:04:40.790> split<00:04:41.150> open

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
veins were soft and some had split open

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.000 
veins were soft and some had split open
they<00:04:43.040> were<00:04:43.100> done<00:04:44.350> well<00:04:45.350> that<00:04:45.590> was<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> lot<00:04:45.950> of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
they were done well that was a lot of

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.670 
they were done well that was a lot of
fun<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.490> hope<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.910> were<00:04:47.000> amused<00:04:47.390> I<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:48.440> some

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
fun I hope you were amused I have some

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.550 
fun I hope you were amused I have some
ideas<00:04:49.070> for<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.370> next<00:04:49.460> prototype<00:04:50.229> so<00:04:51.229> stay

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
ideas for the next prototype so stay

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:02.650 
ideas for the next prototype so stay
tuned<00:04:51.979> and<00:04:52.510> thanks<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.780> viewing
