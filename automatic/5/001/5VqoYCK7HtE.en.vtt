but it's substantially reduced
it<00:06:05.360> went<00:06:05.660> from<00:06:05.840> 58<00:06:06.800> decibels<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:08.510> 50<00:06:08.870> decibels

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
it went from 58 decibels to 50 decibels

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.290 
it went from 58 decibels to 50 decibels
eight<00:06:10.130> decimal<00:06:10.400> reduction<00:06:11.000> which<00:06:11.150> is

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
eight decimal reduction which is

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.120 
eight decimal reduction which is
substantially<00:06:12.200> more<00:06:12.350> than<00:06:12.530> I<00:06:12.620> was<00:06:12.740> told<00:06:13.010> it

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
substantially more than I was told it

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.100 
substantially more than I was told it
would<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.550> as<00:06:14.120> as<00:06:14.360> I<00:06:14.600> thought<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.990> would

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
would and as as I thought it would
