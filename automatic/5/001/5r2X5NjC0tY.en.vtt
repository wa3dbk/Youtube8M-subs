00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
piece I'm going to actually make into a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.519 
piece I'm going to actually make into a
card<00:00:22.970> just<00:00:23.970> isn't<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.600> done<00:00:24.930> yet<00:00:25.170> but

card just isn't all the way done yet but

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.670 
card just isn't all the way done yet but
before<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.699> wanted<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:28.019> fun

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
before I do that I wanted to make a fun

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.640 
before I do that I wanted to make a fun
little<00:00:29.420> project<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.810> goes<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.529> what

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
little project that goes with it so what

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
little project that goes with it so what
I<00:00:31.710> did<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> stamped<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.270> fabric<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I did is actually I stamped on fabric I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030 
I did is actually I stamped on fabric I
used<00:00:34.469> versa<00:00:34.920> craft<00:00:35.899> chocolate<00:00:36.899> ink<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.290> heat

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
used versa craft chocolate ink and heat

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
used versa craft chocolate ink and heat
set<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.700> iron<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> ready<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> go

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
set it with my iron so it's ready to go

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
set it with my iron so it's ready to go
so<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.489> coloring<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.969> brown

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so when you're coloring with brown

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
so when you're coloring with brown
fabric<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.469> bit<00:00:43.620> different<00:00:43.980> than

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fabric it's a little bit different than

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240 
fabric it's a little bit different than
coloring<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.610> paper<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:46.250> weave

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
coloring on paper as there is weave

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
coloring on paper as there is weave
natural<00:00:47.940> weave<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> fabric<00:00:48.870> try<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> use

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
natural weave in the fabric try and use

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.360 
natural weave in the fabric try and use
a<00:00:49.500> high<00:00:49.950> thread<00:00:50.730> count<00:00:51.059> cotton<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.129> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a high thread count cotton and and then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
a high thread count cotton and and then
your<00:00:53.520> colors<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.090> spread<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.960> much

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
your colors don't spread quite as much

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
your colors don't spread quite as much
so<00:00:56.449> here<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.570> gonna<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.260> e21<00:00:58.890> marker<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so here I'm gonna take my e21 marker and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
so here I'm gonna take my e21 marker and
I'm<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.149> work<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:01.020> lightest<00:01:01.350> area

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
I'm just gonna work on my lightest area

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.490 
I'm just gonna work on my lightest area
first<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.730> her<00:01:02.910> skin<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.719> when

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
first which would be her skin and when

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
first which would be her skin and when
I'm<00:01:04.650> coloring<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.189> fabric<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
I'm coloring on fabric I work kind of in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.710 
I'm coloring on fabric I work kind of in
the<00:01:06.900> middle<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.740> add<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.400> ink<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.450> kind

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the middle and I add some ink and I kind

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
the middle and I add some ink and I kind
of<00:01:09.780> wait<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> spread<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of wait for it to spread and then when I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.550 
of wait for it to spread and then when I
need<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.170> add<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.619> ink<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:15.420> add<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
need to add more ink I just add a little

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
need to add more ink I just add a little
more<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.189> wait<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> spread<00:01:18.090> because

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
more and wait for it to spread because

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.100 
more and wait for it to spread because
it'll<00:01:18.720> spread<00:01:19.020> quite<00:01:19.259> quickly<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it'll spread quite quickly on you and so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
it'll spread quite quickly on you and so
I<00:01:22.140> often<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:23.100> color<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.060> middle<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.509> an

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I often all color down the middle of an

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.859 
I often all color down the middle of an
object<00:01:25.159> wait<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.580> ink<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.090> spread<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> me

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
object wait for my ink to spread on me

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.240 
object wait for my ink to spread on me
and<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:30.259> touch<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and then touch it some more where you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.920 
and then touch it some more where you
need<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> fill<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> line<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
need to fill it in right to the line so

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
need to fill it in right to the line so
it's<00:01:36.930> different<00:01:37.170> than<00:01:37.790> coloring<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.000> paper

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it's different than coloring on paper

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's different than coloring on paper
whereas<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.400> go<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.659> edge

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
whereas you want to go right to the edge

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
whereas you want to go right to the edge
and<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.759> using<00:01:45.750> shading<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.649> colors<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and you are using shading and colors I

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.819 
and you are using shading and colors I
don't<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> lot<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> shading<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> am

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
don't do a lot of shading when I am

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.240 
don't do a lot of shading when I am
coloring<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.820> fabric<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> more

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
coloring on fabric just because the more

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.469 
coloring on fabric just because the more
ink<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.820> add<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> spreads<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
ink you add the more it spreads so and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
ink you add the more it spreads so and
always<00:02:00.479> work<00:02:00.810> under<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> over<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> protected

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
always work under a over a protected

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.230 
always work under a over a protected
surface<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.479> white<00:02:03.780> piece<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> paper

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
surface just a white piece of paper

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.850 
surface just a white piece of paper
because<00:02:06.240> definitely<00:02:06.570> especially<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.320> fabric

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
because definitely especially on fabric

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.279 
because definitely especially on fabric
the<00:02:08.610> markers<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.360> pick<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.750> whatever<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the markers will pick up whatever you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.480 
the markers will pick up whatever you
have<00:02:10.530> underneath

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
have underneath

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.080 
have underneath
and<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> definitely<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:13.460> clean<00:02:14.460> white

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and so you definitely want clean white

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.850 
and so you definitely want clean white
paper<00:02:15.420> under<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.290> you're<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
paper under there so you're not going to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.570 
paper under there so you're not going to
get<00:02:16.980> any<00:02:17.190> funny<00:02:17.540> looks<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.930> your<00:02:19.590> project<00:02:20.660> so

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
get any funny looks in your project so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.710 
get any funny looks in your project so
that's<00:02:23.580> her<00:02:23.850> skin<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.480> touch

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that's her skin and I go up and I touch

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.260 
that's her skin and I go up and I touch
it<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> very<00:02:28.950> end<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.580> little<00:02:30.120> bit

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
it up up at the very end a little bit

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.330 
it up up at the very end a little bit
later<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.710> moving<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.760> her<00:02:34.160> let's<00:02:35.160> see

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
later so moving on to her let's see

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850 
later so moving on to her let's see
let's<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> bowl<00:02:36.150> now<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> bowl<00:02:37.230> that's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
let's do the bowl now the bowl that's

let's do the bowl now the bowl that's
something<00:02:38.670> that's<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.240> very<00:02:39.450> tricky

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
something that's going to be very tricky

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.040 
something that's going to be very tricky
in<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.970> project<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.270> saw<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.810> did

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
in this project that you saw here I did

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.650 
in this project that you saw here I did
my<00:02:43.200> bowl<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.710> red<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.280> Red's<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.510> know

my bowl in a red and Red's if you know

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.650 
my bowl in a red and Red's if you know
Copic<00:02:46.020> markers<00:02:46.380> at<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.270> get<00:02:48.540> away

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
Copic markers at all can really get away

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.830 
Copic markers at all can really get away
on<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.880> spread<00:02:50.880> very<00:02:51.060> quickly<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.810> you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
on you and spread very quickly so you

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960 
on you and spread very quickly so you
have<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.290> very<00:02:52.530> light<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.580> your<00:02:53.700> hand

have to be very light with your hand
with<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.210> red<00:02:54.510> markers<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.710> am<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.370> to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
with the red markers so I am going to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.820 
with the red markers so I am going to
start<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.880> our<00:02:56.910> 27<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.110> I'm<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.740> to

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
start with our 27 and I'm just going to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:11.780 
start with our 27 and I'm just going to
start<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.570> middle

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.619 

and<00:03:12.329> just<00:03:12.840> wait<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.530> let<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.890> let<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.849> go<00:03:17.629> now

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
and just wait and let it let it go now

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.330 
and just wait and let it let it go now
if<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.989> find<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.439> your<00:03:19.680> color<00:03:19.890> spreads

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
if you find that your color spreads

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.660 
if you find that your color spreads
beyond<00:03:20.909> your<00:03:21.359> stamped<00:03:21.900> image<00:03:22.290> line<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:23.519> not

beyond your stamped image line do not

beyond your stamped image line do not
try<00:03:23.969> to<00:03:24.000> fix<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.599> with<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> blender<00:03:25.260> pen

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:25.469 
try to fix this with a blender pen

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.369 
try to fix this with a blender pen
because<00:03:25.829> what<00:03:26.280> it'll<00:03:26.549> do<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.659> make<00:03:28.349> a

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
because what it'll do is it will make a

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.009 
because what it'll do is it will make a
little<00:03:28.620> pool<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.340> ink<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.540> red<00:03:30.750> will<00:03:30.989> go

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
little pool of ink that the red will go

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.170 
little pool of ink that the red will go
on<00:03:31.439> want<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.950> go<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.280> play<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.640> your<00:03:32.790> pool<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
on want to go and play in your pool of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.740 
on want to go and play in your pool of
ink<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.379> this<00:03:34.950> case<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:36.180> different<00:03:36.299> than

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
ink so in this case it's different than

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.629 
ink so in this case it's different than
paper<00:03:37.019> where<00:03:37.439> you<00:03:37.470> do<00:03:37.829> not<00:03:37.950> want<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.370> try<00:03:38.579> with

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
paper where you do not want to try with

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.059 
paper where you do not want to try with
your<00:03:39.150> blender<00:03:39.329> pen<00:03:39.659> now<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.889> have<00:03:41.010> a

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
your blender pen now I want to have a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.059 
your blender pen now I want to have a
little<00:03:41.430> bit<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.810> color<00:03:42.810> variation<00:03:43.049> in<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:43.920> so

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
little bit of color variation in here so

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.580 
little bit of color variation in here so
I'm<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.489> try<00:03:44.849> just<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:46.170> add<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.409> little

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
I'm going to try just to add a little

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.460 
I'm going to try just to add a little
this<00:03:47.040> r39<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.209> my<00:03:48.389> deeper<00:03:48.840> red<00:03:50.840> down<00:03:51.840> towards

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
this r39 it's my deeper red down towards

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.589 
this r39 it's my deeper red down towards
the<00:03:52.650> bottle<00:03:53.010> bottom<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.939> bowl<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.419> could

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
the bottle bottom of this bowl it could

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.360 
the bottle bottom of this bowl it could
be<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> little<00:03:55.079> tricky<00:03:55.470> because<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.950> get<00:03:56.099> close

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
be a little tricky because you get close

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.960 
be a little tricky because you get close
to<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.639> skintone<00:03:57.510> color<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.579> wanted

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
to that skintone color but I just wanted

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.649 
to that skintone color but I just wanted
to<00:04:00.030> add<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:01.519> little<00:04:02.519> bit<00:04:02.639> of<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:02.970> deeper<00:04:03.419> color

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
to add a little bit of that deeper color

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.830 
to add a little bit of that deeper color
down<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.319> at<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.500> bottom<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.689> then<00:04:06.689> I'm

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
down here at the bottom and then I'm

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:15.949 
down here at the bottom and then I'm
going<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.079> come<00:04:07.349> back<00:04:08.180> with<00:04:09.180> my<00:04:09.530> r-27<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.959> I'm

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
going to come back with my r-27 and I'm

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.779 
going to come back with my r-27 and I'm
not<00:04:16.139> worrying<00:04:16.560> too<00:04:16.590> much<00:04:16.829> about<00:04:17.039> running<00:04:17.639> into

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
not worrying too much about running into

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.479 
not worrying too much about running into
that<00:04:18.000> spoon<00:04:18.479> because<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.620> spoon<00:04:20.010> I'm<00:04:20.280> just

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
that spoon because that spoon I'm just

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.820 
that spoon because that spoon I'm just
going<00:04:20.699> to<00:04:20.760> go<00:04:20.970> over<00:04:21.329> top<00:04:21.989> of<00:04:22.019> later<00:04:22.500> with<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
going to go over top of later with a

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.770 
going to go over top of later with a
dark<00:04:24.020> speaker<00:04:25.020> glitter<00:04:25.289> pen<00:04:26.479> so<00:04:27.479> I'm<00:04:27.630> not

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
just going to start by rubbing in the

just going to start by rubbing in the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.830 

see<00:05:28.100> how<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.250> just<00:05:28.340> cover<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.940> middle<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.450> then

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.309 
and I think it's okay if you have a
little<00:06:01.849> bit<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.180> Lenin<00:06:02.689> II<00:06:02.780> look<00:06:03.050> on<00:06:03.199> the

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599
