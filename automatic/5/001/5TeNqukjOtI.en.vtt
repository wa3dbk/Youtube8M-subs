00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.440 
now I'm waiting for my team to push up a
little<00:01:15.430> more<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:15.670> want<00:01:15.910> definitely<00:01:16.330> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
little more I want definitely the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.730 
little more I want definitely the
spotting<00:01:16.870> I<00:01:17.020> don't<00:01:17.200> worry<00:01:17.320> usually<00:01:17.530> do<00:01:17.650> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
spotting I don't worry usually do the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.070 
spotting I don't worry usually do the
spotting<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.310> thing<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.600> was<00:01:19.780> lucky

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
spotting in this thing that was lucky

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.570 
spotting in this thing that was lucky
shot<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.500> took<00:01:20.530> bit<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> hit<00:01:21.100> there<00:01:21.310> but<00:01:21.460> we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
shot we took bit of a hit there but we

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.050 
shot we took bit of a hit there but we
did<00:01:21.960> 1600<00:01:22.960> damage<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:24.220> guy<00:01:24.430> with<00:01:24.640> that<00:01:24.790> shot

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
did 1600 damage that guy with that shot

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
did 1600 damage that guy with that shot
so<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.450> think<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:25.990> more<00:01:26.260> than<00:01:26.410> worth<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so I think that was more than worth the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.560 
so I think that was more than worth the
295<00:01:27.880> damage

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
295 damage

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.530 
295 damage
we<00:01:29.110> took<00:01:29.350> doing<00:01:29.680> that<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:31.000> worry<00:01:31.180> we'll<00:01:31.390> see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
we took doing that don't worry we'll see

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.010 
we took doing that don't worry we'll see
that<00:01:31.720> guy<00:01:31.870> again<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:34.480> a<00:01:34.570> shame<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.810> he

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
that guy again and it's a shame that he

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.480 
that guy again and it's a shame that he

well<00:01:54.040> he<00:01:54.310> might<00:01:54.520> peek<00:01:55.120> up<00:01:55.300> over<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.750> hill

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
well he might peek up over the hill

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.320 
well he might peek up over the hill
there<00:01:56.280> hoping<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.370> get<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.520> shot<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:58.000> me<00:01:58.150> he

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
there hoping to get a shot in on me he

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.000 
there hoping to get a shot in on me he
might<00:01:58.540> know<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.870> here<00:01:59.229> because<00:01:59.380> when<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.770> shot

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.960 
might know I'm here because when I shot
that<00:02:00.160> t-62a<00:02:02.220> but<00:02:03.220> I'm<00:02:03.340> gonna<00:02:03.460> give<00:02:03.610> up<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.850> him

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
in a second here I decided he's probably

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.370 
in a second here I decided he's probably
not<00:02:05.620> coming<00:02:05.860> up<00:02:06.040> or<00:02:07.000> maybe<00:02:07.780> he's<00:02:07.960> smarter<00:02:08.050> than

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
not coming up or maybe he's smarter than

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.580 
not coming up or maybe he's smarter than
that<00:02:08.440> or<00:02:08.740> maybe<00:02:08.920> he's<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.250> unlucky<00:02:09.940> or<00:02:10.590> lucky

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that or maybe he's just unlucky or lucky

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.130 
that or maybe he's just unlucky or lucky
enough<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.010> not<00:02:12.400> come<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.700> there<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:14.020> I'm

well our team ended up losing in the
long<00:04:18.100> run<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:19.870> say<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.620> carried<00:04:21.609> that

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.870 
I tried certainly did the most of
anybody<00:04:28.990> damage<00:04:29.800> wise<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.669> think

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
anybody damage wise and I think

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.670

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
experience wise - as you see by the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.110 
experience wise - as you see by the
after<00:04:33.010> battle<00:04:33.280> report<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.370> wasn't
