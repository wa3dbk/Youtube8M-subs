variations and stuff you could do and so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
variations and stuff you could do and so
yeah<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.500> about<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.680> age<00:01:52.920> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
yeah what do you think about that age is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.679 
yeah what do you think about that age is
doing<00:01:53.250> maybe<00:01:53.520> stopping<00:01:53.850> power<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.299> juggernaut

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
doing maybe stopping power or juggernaut

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.969 
doing maybe stopping power or juggernaut
or<00:01:54.780> something<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.110> should<00:01:55.320> return<00:01:55.619> for

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
or something like that should return for

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.569 
or something like that should return for
Malta<00:01:56.340> more<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.579> free<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.979> think<00:01:58.979> it'd<00:01:59.549> be

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
Malta more for free and I think it'd be

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.670 
Malta more for free and I think it'd be
good<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> could<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.560> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
good if you could get you know a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
good if you could get you know a
one-shot<00:02:02.189> kill<00:02:02.549> from<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.390> stomach<00:02:03.630> up

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
one-shot kill from the stomach up

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
one-shot kill from the stomach up
without<00:02:04.649> stopping<00:02:05.189> power<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.729> was

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
without stopping power if there was

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
without stopping power if there was

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
stopping power within the game and if

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820 
stopping power within the game and if
they<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.759> include<00:02:09.300> juggernaut<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
they were to include juggernaut then I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.190 
they were to include juggernaut then I
you<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.819> could<00:02:11.970> take<00:02:12.150> stopping<00:02:12.599> power

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
you you could take stopping power

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
you you could take stopping power

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.580

doesn't<00:02:18.030> work<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.450> snipers<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> he<00:02:19.290> always

hitbox<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.819> what<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.629> little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
hitbox so what would be a little bit the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.960 
hitbox so what would be a little bit the
effect<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.250> stopping<00:02:26.489> power<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
effect of like stopping power on the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.300 
effect of like stopping power on the
snipers<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.360> would<00:02:27.660> still<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.190> stopping<00:02:29.190> power

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
snipers in would still be stopping power

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.699 
snipers in would still be stopping power
not<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.849> effect<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> sniper<00:02:30.510> or<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
not have an effect on the sniper or it

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.410 
not have an effect on the sniper or it
would<00:02:32.010> maybe<00:02:32.190> get<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.700> shot<00:02:32.880> from<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
would maybe get one shot from like the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.699 
would maybe get one shot from like the
leg<00:02:33.660> upwards<00:02:34.050> or<00:02:34.170> something<00:02:34.440> or<00:02:34.530> would<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
leg upwards or something or would that

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.530 
leg upwards or something or would that
be<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.130> little<00:02:35.370> bit<00:02:35.519> too<00:02:35.700> overbearing<00:02:36.030> I've

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
be a little bit too overbearing I've

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.750 
be a little bit too overbearing I've
ever<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.860> don't<00:02:38.400> think<00:02:38.459> it'd<00:02:38.730> be

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
ever it I don't think it'd be

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.490 
ever it I don't think it'd be
overpowered<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.769> be<00:02:41.360> too

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
overpowered but I think it would be too

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.869 
overpowered but I think it would be too
powerful<00:02:43.500> compared<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.430> what<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.849> know

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
powerful compared to what you know

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.180 
powerful compared to what you know
sniping<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:46.200> black<00:02:46.590> ops<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.069> what

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
sniping is in black ops and what

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.509 
sniping is in black ops and what
sleeping<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:48.000> ever<00:02:48.209> been<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.950> think

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
sleeping has ever been you and I think

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.750 
sleeping has ever been you and I think
that<00:02:50.989> maybe<00:02:51.989> stolen<00:02:52.890> power<00:02:53.040> only<00:02:53.310> count<00:02:53.700> goes

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that maybe stolen power only count goes

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
that maybe stolen power only count goes
juggernaut<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.750> sniper<00:02:54.989> rifle<00:02:55.470> but

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
juggernaut for the sniper rifle but

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.259 
juggernaut for the sniper rifle but
obviously<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.819> benefit<00:02:57.239> of

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
obviously you get the benefit of

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.300 
obviously you get the benefit of
stopping<00:02:57.720> power<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.260> your<00:02:58.560> second<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.220> he

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
stopping power for your second that he

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.819 
stopping power for your second that he
went<00:02:59.459> yeah<00:02:59.610> cool<00:03:00.480> would<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.380> think<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.650> like

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
went yeah cool would you think of like

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.620 
went yeah cool would you think of like
the<00:03:02.010> likes<00:03:02.519> coat<00:03:02.819> or<00:03:02.970> something<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> don't

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the likes coat or something like I don't

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.059 
the likes coat or something like I don't
know<00:03:03.810> don't<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.500> how<00:03:04.650> many<00:03:04.799> snipers

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
know don't know how many snipers

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.740 
know don't know how many snipers
actually<00:03:05.640> use<00:03:05.819> something<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:06.209> scope<00:03:06.540> maybe

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
actually use something like scope maybe

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually use something like scope maybe
like<00:03:06.900> scope<00:03:07.170> for<00:03:07.440> something<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.860> quite<00:03:07.980> useful

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
like scope for something is quite useful

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.030 
like scope for something is quite useful
but<00:03:08.549> like<00:03:09.329> ethanol<00:03:09.720> I've<00:03:10.349> never<00:03:10.620> really<00:03:10.890> seen

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
but like ethanol I've never really seen

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.009 
but like ethanol I've never really seen
anyone<00:03:11.400> used<00:03:11.579> scope<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.090> super<00:03:12.510> effectively

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
anyone used scope like super effectively

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.020 
anyone used scope like super effectively
on<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.170> sniper<00:03:13.440> him<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.430> then<00:03:14.579> again<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.940> don't

whether like what the effect of
juggernaut<00:05:02.430> or<00:05:02.610> what<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:02.970> effect<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.240> sleep

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.879 
juggernaut or what the effect of sleep
base<00:05:03.720> sorry<00:05:04.050> stopping<00:05:04.380> power<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.800> be

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
base sorry stopping power is going to be

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.770 
base sorry stopping power is going to be
on<00:05:05.069> the<00:05:05.190> sniper<00:05:05.400> rifles<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:05.940> kind<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.150> like

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
on the sniper rifles and kind of like

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.689 
on the sniper rifles and kind of like
that<00:05:07.289> kind<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.560> aspect<00:05:07.770> as<00:05:08.009> well<00:05:08.039> but<00:05:08.460> didn't

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
that kind of aspect as well but didn't

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.399 
that kind of aspect as well but didn't
collect<00:05:08.880> second<00:05:09.240> chance<00:05:09.449> so<00:05:09.659> I<00:05:09.690> think<00:05:09.870> snipers

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
collect second chance so I think snipers

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.589 
collect second chance so I think snipers
like<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.830> shot<00:05:11.009> gun<00:05:11.159> shoots<00:05:11.550> like<00:05:11.940> canceled

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
like the shot gun shoots like canceled

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.999 
like the shot gun shoots like canceled
second<00:05:12.900> chance<00:05:13.110> because<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.740> think<00:05:13.949> they

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
second chance because I think they

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.559 
second chance because I think they
should<00:05:14.159> like<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.550> honestly<00:05:15.030> think<00:05:15.210> they<00:05:15.389> should

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
should like I honestly think they should

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.450 
should like I honestly think they should
the<00:05:16.139> air<00:05:16.259> looks<00:05:16.470> like<00:05:16.590> maybe<00:05:16.770> any<00:05:17.069> second

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
the air looks like maybe any second

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.230 
the air looks like maybe any second
chances<00:05:17.639> if<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.360> get<00:05:18.509> hit<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.870> snipers<00:05:20.240> this

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
chances if you get hit and snipers this

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.839 
chances if you get hit and snipers this
paper<00:05:21.479> shoot<00:05:21.990> canceled<00:05:22.560> second<00:05:22.979> chance<00:05:23.280> but

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
paper shoot canceled second chance but

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.300 
paper shoot canceled second chance but
the<00:05:24.120> end<00:05:24.389> of<00:05:24.569> the<00:05:24.690> day<00:05:24.870> like<00:05:25.110> we<00:05:25.620> are<00:05:25.800> running

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
the end of the day like we are running

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.339 
the end of the day like we are running
and<00:05:26.610> gunning<00:05:26.729> with<00:05:27.030> snipers<00:05:27.509> using<00:05:27.870> them<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.169> a

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
and gunning with snipers using them in a

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.070 
and gunning with snipers using them in a
way<00:05:28.469> that<00:05:28.500> they're<00:05:28.889> not<00:05:29.280> meant<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.729> be<00:05:29.759> used<00:05:30.090> we

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
way that they're not meant to be used we

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.360 
way that they're not meant to be used we
should<00:05:31.289> think<00:05:31.409> that<00:05:31.590> could<00:05:31.710> be<00:05:31.860> really<00:05:32.069> far

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
should think that could be really far

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.760 
should think that could be really far
away<00:05:32.490> from<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.969> guy<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:33.840> can't<00:05:34.380> see<00:05:34.620> them

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
away from the guy so I can't see them

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.580 
away from the guy so I can't see them
giving<00:05:35.099> us<00:05:35.219> a<00:05:35.479> snake<00:05:36.479> push<00:05:36.750> cancel<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:37.259> taking

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
giving us a snake push cancel and taking

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.809
