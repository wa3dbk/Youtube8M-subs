00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
as you can see in the top corner already

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.900 
as you can see in the top corner already
it<00:00:23.850> says<00:00:24.119> TFW<00:00:24.720> LTE<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.040> we<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.460> taking<00:00:26.520> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it says TFW LTE so we are now taking you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.940 
it says TFW LTE so we are now taking you
in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> TFW<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> says<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.680> straight

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
in the TFW is what it says for straight

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.420 
in the TFW is what it says for straight
talk

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
talk

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.850 
talk
not<00:00:30.330> sure<00:00:30.870> why<00:00:31.020> doesn't<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.500> say<00:00:31.590> straight

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
not sure why doesn't just say straight

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.500 
not sure why doesn't just say straight
talk<00:00:32.129> or<00:00:32.309> anything<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.879> guess<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.330> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
talk or anything but I guess it's the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
talk or anything but I guess it's the
parent<00:00:33.870> company<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
parent company so that's just what it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.939 
parent company so that's just what it
says<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.199> something<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.830> and

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
everything pretty much it synced to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
everything pretty much it synced to
settings<00:00:59.070> over<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.519> started<00:00:59.850> working

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
settings over and it started working

you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:04.190> get<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.549> faster<00:01:05.790> speeds

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you can get a little bit faster speeds

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
you can get a little bit faster speeds
if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.799> jailbreak<00:01:08.370> your<00:01:08.580> iPhone<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> in

all right so we got six on the download
and<00:02:44.200> five<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.800> upload<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.460> attempt
