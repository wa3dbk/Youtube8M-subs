00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.559
 in the sector we find ourselves as judge of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 bank to my teammate 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 massimiliano ferraro who now tells us 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.450
 a moment how it is going 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.789
 says nothing for now I'm coming out it's come out 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 some beautiful castles 33 of 2 cm more or 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 less taken on 60 70 meters in short stuff 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.740
 already heavy two mills came out from 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.740
 their 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.410
 also some chicken as fish from 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.900
 background now expects in the dark why 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.760
 surely some will come out of the dark 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.760
 beautiful murmurs some nice horse mackerels 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.950
 start already there is some more 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.840
 substantial and banquets did not 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.410
 denial no no absolutely not like 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.100
 always its points 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.220
 let us now see from the various e 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.170
 box what they have to tell us about that in 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.320
 which our agonists are 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.640
 comparing it is definitely a sandy shore 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.690
 high energy consisting of a substrate 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.659
 that for the first meters and above all 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.240
 under the zoe however in the same grain a 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.330
 pronounced step you want a trend 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.420
 fairly homogeneous that dives 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.920
 quite quickly towards the open sea 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.880
 as you see behind me there are 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 still about forty athletes 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.400
 corresponding to two 10 box sectors 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.340
 each box is composed of two 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.950
 people with a cane head trying to 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.220
 make a team strategy more 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.470
 intensely possible now we know 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 a couple that I really like about 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.660
 present because they are the two boys who 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.850

 this is a last step 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.670
 it leaves everything for the first twenty months 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:55.620

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.720
 from the current like he brushed 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.720

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.870
 Note 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.250
 why 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.689
 a murmur 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.060
 those a little begin to enter first 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.610
 smaller then it will start to increase 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.110
 very quickly the size because now 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.770
 we are already dark then the big ones 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.770
