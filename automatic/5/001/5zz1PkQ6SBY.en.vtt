of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.439> Maybelline<00:01:22.979> colossal<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.990> as

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
of the Maybelline colossal it's not as

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.760 
of the Maybelline colossal it's not as
big<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> designed<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.049> same<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
big but it's designed the same the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730 
big but it's designed the same the
formula<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.509> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> same<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
formula is kind of the same but it's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
formula is kind of the same but it's
more<00:01:31.979> buildable<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.110> clumpy

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
more buildable and it's not as clumpy

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200 
more buildable and it's not as clumpy
this<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.250> doesn't<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this one really doesn't have a lot of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
this one really doesn't have a lot of
clumping<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.079> honest<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.979> does<00:01:38.220> really

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
clumping to be honest it does really

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.069 
clumping to be honest it does really
thicken<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:38.970> lashes<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> makes<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.900> look

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
thicken your lashes it makes them look

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.969 
thicken your lashes it makes them look
thicker<00:01:40.380> darker<00:01:41.180> denser<00:01:42.500> but<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
thicker darker denser but it really

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
thicker darker denser but it really
doesn't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.270> much<00:01:45.479> clumping<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
doesn't have very much clumping and the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
doesn't have very much clumping and the
clumping<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> does<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.579> taken<00:01:48.210> away

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
clumping that it does have is taken away

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.109 
clumping that it does have is taken away
by<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> second<00:01:49.649> mascara<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> power

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
by the second mascara which is the power

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.889 
by the second mascara which is the power
lash<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:53.399> brush<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.869> odd<00:01:55.049> um<00:01:56.899> it's

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lash and this brush is very odd um it's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.709 
lash and this brush is very odd um it's
a<00:01:58.049> spiral<00:01:58.619> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.430> brush<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
a spiral kind of brush but it's not the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.870 
a spiral kind of brush but it's not the
plastic<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> fiber<00:02:02.280> are<00:02:02.579> really

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
plastic it's like the fiber are really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
plastic it's like the fiber are really
to<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.299> honest<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.719> haven't<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.590> seen<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to be honest I haven't you know seen a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.410 
to be honest I haven't you know seen a
brush<00:02:05.219> quite<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.149> before<00:02:06.210> um

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
brush quite like this before um

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.690 
brush quite like this before um
I<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.619> really<00:02:09.800> doesn't<00:02:10.099> look<00:02:10.130> weird<00:02:10.399> on

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
I know it really doesn't look weird on

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.870 
I know it really doesn't look weird on
here<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.990> real<00:02:12.170> life<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:13.700> just

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
here but it is in real life and I just

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.050 
here but it is in real life and I just
find<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.330> odd<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.140> plastic

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
find it odd that it's not the plastic

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.790 
find it odd that it's not the plastic
it's<00:02:17.060> actually<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.510> fiber<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.140> works<00:02:18.440> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's actually the fiber and it works so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.890 
it's actually the fiber and it works so
well<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.700> lengthens<00:02:20.500> lashes<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:21.890> well<00:02:22.069> i

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
well it lengthens lashes really well i

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.420 
well it lengthens lashes really well i
have<00:02:23.900> very<00:02:24.110> stubborn<00:02:24.590> eyelashes<00:02:25.280> my

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

have very stubborn eyelashes my
eyelashes<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.239> not<00:02:26.690> ever<00:02:26.930> do<00:02:27.230> what<00:02:27.410> i<00:02:27.440> want

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.430 
eyelashes do not ever do what i want
them<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.390> or<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.450> least<00:02:29.600> they<00:02:29.720> didn't<00:02:30.050> until

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
them to do or at least they didn't until

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.900 
them to do or at least they didn't until
