00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439 

okay<00:00:00.539> back<00:00:01.380> with<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.740> folks<00:00:02.030> here's<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.300> new

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay back with you folks here's the new

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.280 
okay back with you folks here's the new
cell<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:03.959> just<00:00:04.230> made<00:00:05.240> using<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.509> star<00:00:06.810> pattern

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
cell we just made using the star pattern

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.820 
cell we just made using the star pattern
and<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.160> using<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.550> selenium<00:00:09.210> doping<00:00:09.830> along

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
and it's using the selenium doping along

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
and it's using the selenium doping along
with<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.309> Elm<00:00:11.490> crystal<00:00:12.259> melted<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
with the Elm crystal melted with the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.680 
with the Elm crystal melted with the
rival<00:00:13.980> salts<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.420> app<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.809> salts<00:00:16.580> and

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
rival salts and the app some salts and

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
rival salts and the app some salts and
it<00:00:18.690> only<00:00:18.990> needs<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.740> very<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.310> doping<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> do

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
it only needs a very little doping to do

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
it only needs a very little doping to do
this<00:00:22.580> okay<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> here's<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.960> voltage<00:00:25.380> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this okay and here's the voltage that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.210 
this okay and here's the voltage that
it's<00:00:26.039> holding<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.710> I'm<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> show<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it's holding and I'm going to show you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.890 
it's holding and I'm going to show you
some<00:00:29.460> mayor<00:00:31.219> we<00:00:32.219> touch<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.520> cell

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.930 

watch

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.799 

so<00:00:43.480> as<00:00:43.660> I<00:00:43.690> heat<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.230> sell<00:00:44.469> it<00:00:44.620> goes<00:00:44.829> down<00:00:45.809> okay

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
so as I heat to sell it goes down okay

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.840 
so as I heat to sell it goes down okay
and<00:00:47.350> then<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.710> current<00:00:48.070> goes<00:00:48.250> down<00:00:48.519> but<00:00:48.699> then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
and then the current goes down but then

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.700 
and then the current goes down but then
the<00:00:48.969> current<00:00:49.269> comes<00:00:49.480> back<00:00:49.780> up<00:00:50.019> as<00:00:50.230> soon<00:00:50.379> as<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
the current comes back up as soon as the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.090 
the current comes back up as soon as the
temperature<00:00:51.129> comes<00:00:51.370> back<00:00:51.640> up<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.739> where<00:00:53.769> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
temperature comes back up to where the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.090 
temperature comes back up to where the
ambient<00:00:54.579> temperature<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.719> once<00:00:55.960> again<00:00:56.110> star

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
ambient temperature so once again star

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.609 
ambient temperature so once again star
pattern<00:00:58.620> magnesium<00:01:01.649> voltage<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.229> there's

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
pattern magnesium voltage and there's

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.960 
pattern magnesium voltage and there's
the<00:01:05.860> flat<00:01:06.130> line<00:01:06.430> chart<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.170> that's<00:01:08.320> exactly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the flat line chart and that's exactly

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.050 
the flat line chart and that's exactly
what<00:01:09.970> you<00:01:10.090> want<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.690> battery<00:01:11.759> more<00:01:12.759> on<00:01:12.880> this

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
what you want in a battery more on this

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.770 
what you want in a battery more on this
later<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:15.310> I've<00:01:15.490> ran<00:01:15.729> another<00:01:16.030> view<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.509> this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
later now I've ran another view of this

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.639 
later now I've ran another view of this
because<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.140> want<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.530> exactly<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.289> cell

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
because I want it exactly how this cell

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.600 
because I want it exactly how this cell
is<00:01:21.460> supposed<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.090> operate<00:01:23.039> that<00:01:24.039> means<00:01:24.399> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
is supposed to operate that means the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.809 
is supposed to operate that means the
impedance<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.240> getting<00:01:25.539> better<00:01:25.720> on<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> self

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
impedance is getting better on the self

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.820 
impedance is getting better on the self
okay<00:01:27.819> and<00:01:28.390> I'll<00:01:28.630> try<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.899> get<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.170> better<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
okay and I'll try to get a better the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.340 
okay and I'll try to get a better the
best<00:01:30.039> Buick<00:01:30.399> end<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.990> can<00:01:32.140> see

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
best Buick end of this and you can see

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.740 
best Buick end of this and you can see
the<00:01:32.380> voltage<00:01:32.649> again<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.409> you<00:01:35.530> can<00:01:35.710> see<00:01:36.750> how

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
the voltage again and you can see how

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.100 
the voltage again and you can see how
the<00:01:37.810> cells<00:01:38.289> made<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:40.270> made<00:01:40.509> with<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.750> star

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the cells made it's made with a star

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.490 
the cells made it's made with a star
pattern<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:44.020> slight<00:01:44.619> amount<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:45.100> doping<00:01:46.500> on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
pattern very slight amount of doping on

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
pattern very slight amount of doping on
a<00:01:47.560> very<00:01:47.979> controlled<00:01:48.869> temperature<00:01:50.819> on<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.879> mix

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
a very controlled temperature on the mix

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.660 
a very controlled temperature on the mix
when<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.709> being<00:01:53.950> heated<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> more<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.459> this

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
when it's being heated so more on this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.550 
when it's being heated so more on this
later

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.619 

you
