00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.630

connector<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.600> all<00:02:35.840> digital<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.590> it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.699 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:02:37.400> for<00:02:37.550> today's<00:02:37.790> uses<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:39.380> made<00:02:39.560> it

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.270 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.850> fits<00:02:41.090> either<00:02:41.360> way<00:02:42.100> we<00:02:43.100> also

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
