being<00:00:30.599> suggested<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
being suggested to me that this is the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.940 
being suggested to me that this is the
way<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> team<00:00:32.669> play<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.440> think<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
way the team play i think that it's a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
way the team play i think that it's a
complex<00:00:35.610> matter<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> sense<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.300> in<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
complex matter in the sense that in the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
complex matter in the sense that in the
course<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.170> game<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.920> could<00:00:41.160> prove<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.670> lot

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
course of a game you could prove a lot

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340 
course of a game you could prove a lot
of<00:00:41.969> things<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.629> prove<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of things you could prove a lot of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
of things you could prove a lot of
systems<00:00:43.680> by<00:00:44.010> stopping<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> game<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.059> one

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
systems by stopping the game at any one

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
systems by stopping the game at any one
time<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> suggesting<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> system

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
time and suggesting this is a system

time and suggesting this is a system
they<00:00:47.910> play<00:00:48.469> we<00:00:49.469> work<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.920> principles<00:00:50.840> things

they play we work on principles things

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.580 
they play we work on principles things
would<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.110> attacked<00:00:52.379> principle<00:00:52.920> defense

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
would have attacked principle defense

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.910 
would have attacked principle defense
obviously<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:57.050> every<00:00:58.050> team<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.800> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to to make the pitch smaller when we're

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
to to make the pitch smaller when we're
defending<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
picture bigger when we were attacking I

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.300 
picture bigger when we were attacking I
think<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.760> preach<00:01:15.650> positivity<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:17.159> our

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
think that we preach positivity in our

think that we preach positivity in our
attacking<00:01:17.700> play<00:01:18.200> players<00:01:19.200> having<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to receive the ball even in tight

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.550 
to receive the ball even in tight

we're<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> team<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:32.189> saying<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.090> in

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
we're not a team I'm saying what it's in

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
we're not a team I'm saying what it's in
favor<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:35.240> 500<00:01:36.240> passes<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.900> which<00:01:37.110> 460<00:01:38.100> are

between your goal keeping your back for

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
between your goal keeping your back for
I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> score<00:01:41.670> goals<00:01:41.970> you've<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
I think the score goals you've got to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
I think the score goals you've got to
get<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> ball<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.380> field<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
get the ball up the field so we

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
get the ball up the field so we
encourage<00:01:44.430> our<00:01:44.729> plans<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.299> look<00:01:45.570> forward

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
encourage our plans to look forward

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.120 
encourage our plans to look forward
whenever<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.700> play<00:01:47.909> forward<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.130> if

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
whenever they can to play forward but if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
whenever they can to play forward but if
they<00:01:50.430> can't<00:01:50.700> play<00:01:50.939> forward<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> keep

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
they can't play forward to keep

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.700 
they can't play forward to keep
possession<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.259> look<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> better

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
possession and look for a better

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
possession and look for a better
opportunity<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.820> varies<00:01:54.360> from<00:01:54.509> team<00:01:54.780> to

opportunity what varies from team to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
opportunity what varies from team to

team is the quality of the platicas if

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.550 
team is the quality of the platicas if
you've<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.570> people<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.079> Messi<00:01:58.380> Xavi

three<00:02:05.880> we'll<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> wait<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.869> when

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
three we'll have to wait and see when

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
three we'll have to wait and see when
those<00:02:07.380> three<00:02:07.680> stop<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.220> got<00:02:08.369> three<00:02:08.640> who

those three stop are they got three who

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780 
those three stop are they got three who
