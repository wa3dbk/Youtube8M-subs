00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.259
 I have six years of NATO leave 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.679
 the pri since then 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.330
 - yes a lot ltd 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
 they make instruments 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.179
 we all have 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.429
 united states supports the government 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.559
 I'm afraid that some holes in the defense is saying 'I'm going through the twelve 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.390
 months of 0 13% 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.879
 a few days ago after the coup the coup d'etat to say of some 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.920
 made the sixth year was their life 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 fire 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 I found some of your spokespersons in my backyard 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.209
 i 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.250
 this interests us is this way 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.890
 are not being used then global I decided 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 using them 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.299
 that yes you are worth the manufacturer under a musical instrument 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 who is something that caught my attention 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 as well as he heard it 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 tubes that will be the most are just waste 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.479
 Mauricio sees them as the perfect material to get his melodies 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 they made me two years ago with the idea 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 and now 21 plants of different sizes and shapes are the result 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 this man looks proud 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.580
 the Mauritian talent is quite remarkable 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.820
 percent the ability to take something that is plastic something that does not have much 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.880
 sense in itself and being able to make an instrument to be able to make music something that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.190
 they processed residential souls that music is part comes a feeling 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.430
 that's quite remarkable i that's why I today supported him he is a person 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.569
 very talented 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.470
 touch 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.709
 he touches what they put him and he learns it was only from him is very very good 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.069
 and aena 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.849
 Manuela Mena commented noon within that incident and in this case 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.629
 all this heads of missions are all in the elections 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.679
 figures in viale bring one 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 and in the middle of a class I sit up 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.809
 from Iquique which is a small plant 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.739
 the unam is a larger movement that has made 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:12.219
 has not given today's option in the villa's most perverse history 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.869
 and that sounds similar to a saxophone 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.869
 I love them 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.319
 bimbo the membrane flute life 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.359
 contains these instruments slabs in a matter of two to four hours 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.169
 with him from that in two different positions in the sun 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.529
 of different media that at first did not work 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.099
 but component 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.789
 keeps doing more and more with the help of an electronic tuner I'm 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.310
 taking the measurements 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.169
 until you achieve not an estimate 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.669
 this man has enough tubes and waste materials to be planted 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.669
 that have nothing to envy to the best in the world 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.349
 now these melodies 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.349
 they sound to the rhythm of the bad taste flutes 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:17.629
 little by little now 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:18.189
 slowly
