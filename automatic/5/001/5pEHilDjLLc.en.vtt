00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.830 
but in this case we're just going to
load<00:02:55.390> three<00:02:55.720> because<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.049> really<00:02:56.170> easy<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
load three because it's really easy to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.370 
load three because it's really easy to
so<00:02:58.840> there's<00:02:59.530> your<00:02:59.650> court<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:01.720> stick<00:03:02.079> them<00:03:02.170> in

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380

side<00:03:03.250> by<00:03:03.280> side<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.980> case<00:03:06.280> laid<00:03:06.819> on<00:03:06.940> top<00:03:06.970> of

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
side by side in this case laid on top of

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.190 
side by side in this case laid on top of
each<00:03:07.299> other<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.810> holding<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
each other because I'm holding it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.580 
each other because I'm holding it
sideways

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.860 
yep not too much it's just all the stuff
that<00:03:21.920> can<00:03:22.160> do<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.510> m4a1<00:03:26.510> pulse

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
that can do if so that is the m4a1 pulse

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.259 
that can do if so that is the m4a1 pulse
rifle<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:28.330> I'll<00:03:29.330> see<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.840> next<00:03:29.870> time<00:03:31.269> it's
