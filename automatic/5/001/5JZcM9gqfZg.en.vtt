00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.370
 Quick guide on jacques for all 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.620
 those players who do not yet know 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
 jacques or still do not know how they work 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.000
 the mechanics of this character I think 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.980
 which is a pretty generic quick guide 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.570
 and we're not going to get into aspects 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.510
 concrete but we are going to talk about 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.130
 everything that is jacques you have jacks like 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.350
 a will play jacks what to do with it in 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 what to do with the team fights and 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.789
 well a little bit a whole medley in the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.729
 that I will explain how to arm him for 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.239
 to be able to take out of this character all his 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:42.010
 potential let's start with your 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.460
 characteristics 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.430
 jacques is a killer bar fighter is 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.600
 say our build is going to complement 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.079
 between harm and life is to say an of tank is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.049
 a character ml is to say body body 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.030
 loose in early but powerful in the tegen 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.250
 what does this mean that the more 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.259
 advanced a stronger game will 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.909
 returns jacques good in 1 against 1 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.039
 dependent on the william that jacques 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.909
 but a series of objects does not reach that 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:18.220
 potential and easy to buy online is 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.380
 say we can leave jacques you 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.520
 with certain champions as per 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 example rise 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.609
 well once said of these 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.179
 general characteristics of them we go 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.179
 with your skills 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.640
 we begin with the passive of yaks assault 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.110
 relentless basic attacks 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.510
 increases the attack speed of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.670
 yaks in x percent is to say how much more 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.850
 consecutive attacks more speed of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.400
 attack we will have a maximum q 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.500
 brutal assault is an active one that allows 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.570
 and jump on a goal if the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.880
 target is enemy we perform a 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.610
 hurt if it's friends just us 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.220
 we move towards him this can we 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.369
 serve to escape situations 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.410
 dangerous the double uve or potentiation 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.869
 allows the next basic attack or 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.899
 brutal jump of jacques cause damage 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.459
 magical additional this will be the skill 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.050
 that we maximize and prioritize the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.350
 counterattack allows jacques to dodge 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.570
 all basic attacks and receive a 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.450
 25% less skill damage than 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.150
 effect in area at the end of the duration or 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.040
 when this is activated again 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.500
 Stunned ability to all enemies 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 close for a second and it will cause 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.330
 Physical damage this spell causes 20% 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.170
 of the additional year for each attack 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.880
 dodged 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.390
 up to a maximum of 100 percent of 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.000
 increased damage and the ultimate or force 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.370
 of the great master divided into two parts 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 the passive that makes it already cause harm 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
 magical additional in his third attack 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.709
 basic and active that makes it is already 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.440
 win armed magic resistance 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.600
 additional for 8 seconds of all 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.110
 skills we will prioritize first to 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.720
 the r after the w and according to how I go to 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.060
 the game the qo la la q to be more 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.760
 aggressive and the epa to be more defensive 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 apart as you are seeing the damages of 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.480
 jacques' skills scale so much 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.410
 in magic damage as in physical damage by 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.910
 so a hybrid built will be the best 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.180
 for the master's degrees we will choose 121 90 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.790
 as you are seeing in the image 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.239
 while in runes we will opt for 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.370
 attack marks 15 attack essences 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.340
 armor seals by level and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.709
 magic resistance by level also in 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.889
 glyphs unless you do not have by level 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.620
 you can use the flat and if you like 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:46.319
 more you can also change the brands 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.359
 by penetration of armor 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.430
 whatever role we go to 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.680
 take jacques take advantage of objects 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.870
 on your web with attack speed damage 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.579
 physical life robbery and finally objects 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.400
 defensive that grant us weapon debt 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.900
 life and magic resistance an example of 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.780
 an ajax build is what we have in 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.609
 screen an interesting data index is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.260
 that the river leaf ruined and had it are 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.319
 two objects that will be mandatory 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.659
 in all the websites of this character by 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.650
 what because he has so much energy with 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.479
 your skill kit 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.000
 jacques can take both the jungle 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.030
 He commented in the jungle we cleaned the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.820
 camps thanks to the dodge of lae and 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.510
 using potentiation to eliminate 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.640
 those creeps so annoying 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.550
 to rank with jacques will be so easy 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.020
 how to activate it to study it and jump 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.990
 about the enemy we want to eliminate 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.630
 with the q 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.580
 the main role of jacques will be the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.160
 line top in this case our work 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.040
 will consist in forming as much as possible 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.590
 to have an early so weak our 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.420
 enemy will try to deny us the most 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.750
 of possible fan surrounding us with 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.200
 skills just throw us to attack 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.140
 with the help of our jungle the combo 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.910
 with jacks on top will not be different from the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.790
 jungle throwing us with the q the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.100
 empowerment trying to study them with 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.800
 lae jacks is a good character of one 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.060
