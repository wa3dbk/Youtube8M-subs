you<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.369> pretty<00:01:14.490> much<00:01:14.640> called<00:01:14.880> nanos<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you it's pretty much called nanos but

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.639 
you it's pretty much called nanos but
it's<00:01:15.690> pretty<00:01:15.840> much<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> point

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
it's pretty much just like a point

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's pretty much just like a point
system<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.280> gives<00:01:17.399> you<00:01:17.520> points<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.360> nanos

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
system so it gives you points or nanos

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960 
system so it gives you points or nanos
which<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> keep<00:01:20.130> building<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
which then you keep building up and you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.460 
which then you keep building up and you
keep<00:01:21.179> collecting<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:21.929> more<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> more

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
keep collecting more and more and more

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
keep collecting more and more and more
eventually<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.429> will<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> able<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.060> buy

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
have at least 15,000 Nana's otherwise

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.900 
have at least 15,000 Nana's otherwise
you<00:02:50.480> will<00:02:50.600> not<00:02:50.840> be<00:02:51.080> able<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.590> input<00:02:52.370> their<00:02:52.580> code

you will not be able to input their code

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.820 
you will not be able to input their code
which<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:53.959> key<00:02:54.140> factor<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.709> it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
which is a really key factor so it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.170 
which is a really key factor so it
doesn't<00:02:55.100> take<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.370> long<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.850> don't<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.060> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
doesn't take that long you don't have to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.210 
doesn't take that long you don't have to
download<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> couple<00:02:56.780> apps<00:02:57.170> because<00:02:57.860> once<00:02:58.100> you

download a couple apps because once you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.949 
download a couple apps because once you
start<00:02:58.490> off<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.970> start<00:02:59.180> off<00:02:59.360> immediately<00:02:59.600> with

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
start off you start off immediately with

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.040 
start off you start off immediately with
10,000<00:03:00.790> Yanis<00:03:01.790> it'll<00:03:02.300> then<00:03:02.480> reward<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.930> with
