some people like to use a fan to dry it
out<00:00:17.840> a<00:00:17.900> little<00:00:18.080> bit<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.470> it's<00:00:21.650> been

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
out a little bit and and I and it's been

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.580 
out a little bit and and I and it's been
drying<00:00:22.100> for<00:00:22.250> about<00:00:22.520> four<00:00:22.850> hours<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:24.200> reason

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
drying for about four hours the reason

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.470 
drying for about four hours the reason
for<00:00:24.770> this<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.040> that<00:00:25.280> it'll<00:00:26.530> create<00:00:27.530> like<00:00:27.800> a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
for this is that it'll create like a

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.510 
for this is that it'll create like a
shiny<00:00:29.530> tacky<00:00:30.530> when<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:30.890> touch<00:00:31.100> it<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:31.430> a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
shiny tacky when you touch it it's a

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.840 
shiny tacky when you touch it it's a
little<00:00:31.790> sticky<00:00:32.290> surface<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:34.520> called

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
little sticky surface and this is called

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.970 
little sticky surface and this is called
up<00:00:35.090> there's<00:00:35.809> actual<00:00:36.079> term<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.739> called

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
up there's actual term for it called

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.900 
up there's actual term for it called
helical<00:00:37.609> and<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.670> is

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
helical and and this is this is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.340 
helical and and this is this is
important<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:41.809> that<00:00:41.989> when<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.739> smoked<00:00:43.129> that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
important so that when it is smoked that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.829 
important so that when it is smoked that
it'll<00:00:45.350> absorb<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:46.519> smoke<00:00:46.969> flavor<00:00:47.149> into<00:00:47.690> your

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
it'll absorb the smoke flavor into your

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.069 
it'll absorb the smoke flavor into your
fish<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.089> then<00:00:50.089> next<00:00:50.390> step<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.809> that<00:00:50.839> we're

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
fish and then next step is that we're

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.090 
fish and then next step is that we're
going<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.230> go<00:00:51.319> outside<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:51.980> no

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
going to go outside and it's no

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.169 
going to go outside and it's no
efficient<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.769> okay<00:00:54.769> here<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.309> have<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.789> Bradley

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
efficient and okay here I have a Bradley

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.450 
efficient and okay here I have a Bradley
smoker<00:00:56.859> isn't<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:57.949> pretty

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
smoker isn't it pretty

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.090 
smoker isn't it pretty

what I'm doing because I'm can examine

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.410 
what I'm doing because I'm can examine
I'm<00:02:24.420> only<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.200> smoke<00:02:26.150> half<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.299> my

I'm only going to smoke half of my

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.479 
I'm only going to smoke half of my
salmon<00:02:27.950> for<00:02:28.950> two<00:02:29.100> hours<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> rest

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
salmon for two hours and then the rest

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.979 
salmon for two hours and then the rest
will<00:02:32.610> probably<00:02:32.910> leave<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.630> four

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
will probably leave in there for four

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.550 
will probably leave in there for four
hours<00:02:34.019> four<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.739> five<00:02:34.860> hours<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:37.470> I'll

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
hours four to five hours and what I'll

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.170 
hours four to five hours and what I'll
do<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.799> like<00:02:38.130> I'll<00:02:38.310> probably<00:02:38.519> fees<00:02:38.819> or<00:02:39.000> pack

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
do is like I'll probably fees or pack

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.470 
do is like I'll probably fees or pack
these<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.049> these<00:02:41.010> ones<00:02:41.280> I'll<00:02:41.459> probably<00:02:41.910> can

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
these and these ones I'll probably can

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.890 
these and these ones I'll probably can
the<00:02:43.410> reason<00:02:43.830> why<00:02:44.069> it's<00:02:44.580> only<00:02:44.790> two<00:02:45.090> hours<00:02:45.269> for

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the reason why it's only two hours for

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
the reason why it's only two hours for
if<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:46.590> doing<00:02:46.830> canned<00:02:47.069> salmon<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
if I'm doing canned salmon is when you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.800 
if I'm doing canned salmon is when you
can<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.540> salmon<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.280> tends<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.570> create<00:02:54.570> more

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
can the salmon it tends to create more

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.890 
can the salmon it tends to create more
of<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.049> smoke<00:02:55.260> flavor<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:57.209> also<00:02:57.299> dries<00:02:57.690> out

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
of a smoke flavor and it also dries out

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.380 
of a smoke flavor and it also dries out
the<00:02:57.959> fish<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.680> more<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.150> don't

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the fish a little bit more so I don't

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.479 
the fish a little bit more so I don't
want<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.630> smoke<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.049> as<00:03:01.170> long<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:02.310> other

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
want to smoke it as long the other

want to smoke it as long the other
salmon<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.299> I'm<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> keep<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.320> there

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
salmon that I'm going to keep in there

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.380 
salmon that I'm going to keep in there
longer<00:03:04.680> I'll<00:03:05.040> probably<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.730> put<00:03:06.060> them<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.269> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
longer I'll probably just put them in a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.270 
longer I'll probably just put them in a
food<00:03:06.540> saver<00:03:06.810> bag<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.440> put<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.950> freezer

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
food saver bag and put it in the freezer

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.830 
food saver bag and put it in the freezer
now<00:03:09.350> with<00:03:10.350> as<00:03:10.530> far<00:03:10.680> as<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.799> temperature<00:03:11.840> you

now with as far as the temperature you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.050 
now with as far as the temperature you
should<00:03:13.170> smoke<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:16.100> probably<00:03:17.100> around<00:03:17.340> 100

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
should smoke it probably around 100

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.289 
should smoke it probably around 100
maybe<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.299> little<00:03:18.510> bit<00:03:18.690> higher<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.040> last

maybe a little bit higher but the last

you're cold Smith you

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.320 
you're cold Smith you
two<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:35.680> half-an-hour<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.880> at<00:03:36.940> least<00:03:37.120> at

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
two for half-an-hour have it at least at

two for half-an-hour have it at least at
150<00:03:38.170> degrees<00:03:38.500> for<00:03:38.770> half<00:03:38.920> an<00:03:39.040> hour<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.370> make

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
150 degrees for half an hour to make

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.300 
150 degrees for half an hour to make
sure<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.030> kill<00:03:40.630> off<00:03:40.810> any<00:03:40.990> bacteria<00:03:41.800> or

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
sure that you kill off any bacteria or

sure that you kill off any bacteria or
any<00:03:42.490> other<00:03:42.670> things<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.300> might<00:03:43.450> be<00:03:43.570> growing

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
any other things that might be growing

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.240 
any other things that might be growing
on<00:03:44.050> your<00:03:44.140> standing<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.720> for<00:03:47.320> by<00:03:47.530> caning<00:03:48.040> I

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
on your standing but for by caning I

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.040 
on your standing but for by caning I
actually<00:03:48.580> had<00:03:48.880> me<00:03:49.270> correct<00:03:49.570> what<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> said

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
actually had me correct what I said

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.320 
actually had me correct what I said
about<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.530> two-hour<00:03:50.980> thing<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.550> probably

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
about the two-hour thing I probably

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.840 
about the two-hour thing I probably
don't<00:03:52.570> need<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.960> do<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.520> 150<00:03:54.520> degrees

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
don't need to do the the 150 degrees

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.110 
don't need to do the the 150 degrees
because<00:03:55.800> I'm<00:03:56.800> canning<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.970> will<00:03:58.060> be

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
because I'm canning it and that will be

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.270 
because I'm canning it and that will be
hot<00:03:58.390> enough<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.020> I'll<00:03:59.620> cook<00:03:59.890> off<00:04:00.070> any

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
hot enough and I'll cook off any

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.540 
hot enough and I'll cook off any
impurities<00:04:00.820> in<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.960> pressure<00:04:02.170> canner

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
impurities in the in the pressure canner

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.640 
impurities in the in the pressure canner
so<00:04:04.410> that's<00:04:05.410> how<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.710> smoke<00:04:06.070> sin<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.500> been

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
so that's how you smoke sin so it's been

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.170 
so that's how you smoke sin so it's been
a<00:04:08.680> couple<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:09.040> hours<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.580> I'm<00:04:09.850> going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.000> take

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
a couple of hours and I'm going to take

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.860 
a couple of hours and I'm going to take
out<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.480> full<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> racks<00:04:10.930> out<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.470> smoker

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
out the full of racks out of the smoker

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:32.119 
out the full of racks out of the smoker
and<00:04:13.870> this<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.140> gonna<00:04:14.320> be<00:04:14.380> real<00:04:14.530> smoky

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.799 

because<00:04:33.129> there's<00:04:33.459> one<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.879> them<00:04:34.029> and<00:04:34.539> then<00:04:34.689> I'm

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:34.809 
because there's one of them and then I'm

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:47.930 
because there's one of them and then I'm
putting<00:04:35.139> another<00:04:35.649> one<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.249> take<00:04:36.549> out

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.430 

and<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> rest<00:04:49.210> I'm<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.420> going<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.720> believe

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and the rest I'm just going to believe

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.850 
and the rest I'm just going to believe
in<00:04:50.620> there<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.480> smoke<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.630> for<00:04:52.660> another<00:04:52.930> three

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
in there and smoke it for another three

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.350 
in there and smoke it for another three
hours

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
hours

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.780 
hours
for<00:04:55.360> hot<00:04:55.570> smoke<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.230> then<00:04:56.620> these<00:04:57.360> can<00:04:59.340> and<00:05:00.340> I

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
for hot smoke and then these can and I

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.270 
for hot smoke and then these can and I
would<00:05:01.060> highly<00:05:01.450> not<00:05:01.690> suggest<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.410> try<00:05:02.920> it<00:05:02.950> or

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
would highly not suggest you try it or

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.820 
would highly not suggest you try it or
taste<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.790> because<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.810> hasn't<00:05:05.230> gone<00:05:05.320> past<00:05:05.680> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
taste it because it hasn't gone past the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.140 
taste it because it hasn't gone past the
150<00:05:06.490> degree<00:05:07.650> stage<00:05:08.650> where<00:05:09.250> kills<00:05:09.820> off<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.030> the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
150 degree stage where kills off all the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.570 
150 degree stage where kills off all the
bacteria<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:11.200> it<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.440> not<00:05:11.620> safe<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:11.950> eat<00:05:12.100> this

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
bacteria so it is not safe to eat this

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.660 
bacteria so it is not safe to eat this
time<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:16.060> then<00:05:16.560> what<00:05:17.560> I'm<00:05:17.680> when<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.190> can<00:05:18.490> it

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
time and and then what I'm when I can it

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.200 
time and and then what I'm when I can it
then<00:05:18.790> they'll<00:05:18.970> take<00:05:19.210> out<00:05:19.360> all<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:20.160> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
then they'll take out all the the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.340 
then they'll take out all the the
bacteria<00:05:22.210> or<00:05:22.330> any<00:05:22.450> other<00:05:22.690> stuff<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.020> needs

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
bacteria or any other stuff that needs

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.480 
bacteria or any other stuff that needs
to<00:05:23.440> be<00:05:23.470> killed<00:05:23.740> off<00:05:24.300> that's<00:05:25.300> it
