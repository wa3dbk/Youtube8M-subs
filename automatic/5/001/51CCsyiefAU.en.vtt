so<00:00:30.110> far<00:00:30.410> nothing<00:00:30.590> too<00:00:30.890> bad<00:00:31.210> this<00:00:32.210> level<00:00:32.630> might

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
so far nothing too bad this level might

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.640 
so far nothing too bad this level might
end<00:00:33.020> up<00:00:33.140> being<00:00:33.200> enjoyable

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.210 

very<00:00:40.280> easy<00:00:40.580> to<00:00:40.790> get<00:00:40.910> energy<00:00:41.120> tank<00:00:42.070> sure<00:00:43.070> they

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
very easy to get energy tank sure they

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.900 
very easy to get energy tank sure they
would<00:00:43.340> get<00:00:43.460> trapped<00:00:43.760> there

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.040 

but<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> Mario<00:00:50.190> anymore

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.989 

probably<00:05:27.309> could<00:05:27.429> have<00:05:27.459> made<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.639> jump

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
probably could have made that jump

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.399 
probably could have made that jump
anyway<00:05:28.330> but<00:05:28.509> I<00:05:28.539> didn't<00:05:28.749> want<00:05:28.869> to<00:05:28.929> risk<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:30.389> Go

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409

Go switch to heat man's weapon because
it's<00:05:40.239> probably<00:05:40.659> the<00:05:40.779> best<00:05:40.809> way<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.199> go<00:05:41.409> here

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
it's probably the best way to go here

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.100 
it's probably the best way to go here
and<00:05:42.749> let's<00:05:43.749> see<00:05:43.959> what<00:05:44.199> this<00:05:44.589> posturing<00:05:45.099> aside

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
and let's see what this posturing aside

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.290 
and let's see what this posturing aside
seems<00:05:47.110> today<00:05:47.259> fairly<00:05:47.709> standard<00:05:48.219> oh<00:05:49.110> my<00:05:50.110> god<00:05:51.300> go

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
seems today fairly standard oh my god go

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.080 
seems today fairly standard oh my god go
oh<00:05:52.509> man<00:05:53.139> that's<00:05:53.349> cheap

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.730 

come<00:05:59.090> on

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.070 

what<00:06:03.340> it's<00:06:03.669> not<00:06:03.849> effective<00:06:04.569> against<00:06:04.930> them

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
what it's not effective against them

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.730 
what it's not effective against them
what<00:06:05.259> the<00:06:05.470> hell<00:06:05.680> i<00:06:06.690> read<00:06:07.690> okay<00:06:08.199> let's<00:06:08.410> go<00:06:08.590> with

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
what the hell i read okay let's go with

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.680 
what the hell i read okay let's go with
the<00:06:08.830> opposite<00:06:09.340> logic<00:06:09.729> to<00:06:09.849> this<00:06:09.880> time<00:06:10.240> is

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
the opposite logic to this time is

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.050 
the opposite logic to this time is
bubbleman<00:06:11.169> to<00:06:11.440> either<00:06:14.669> going<00:06:15.669> against

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
bubbleman to either going against

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.400 
bubbleman to either going against
everything<00:06:16.180> that<00:06:16.449> Pokemon<00:06:16.960> has<00:06:17.110> taught<00:06:17.380> us

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
everything that Pokemon has taught us

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.550 
everything that Pokemon has taught us
and<00:06:17.940> I<00:06:18.940> guess<00:06:19.270> that<00:06:19.449> was<00:06:19.539> right<00:06:19.810> Wow<00:06:21.960> ok<00:06:22.960> tip<00:06:23.380> if

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
and I guess that was right Wow ok tip if

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.200 
and I guess that was right Wow ok tip if
you're<00:06:23.710> going<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:23.919> play<00:06:24.069> this<00:06:24.160> game<00:06:24.520> think
