my yolks note can run three games at the
same<00:01:40.600> time<00:01:40.900> i<00:01:41.260> think<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.270> RAM

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
same time i think that the RAM

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.400 
same time i think that the RAM
management<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:45.670> improved<00:01:46.090> if<00:01:46.810> we<00:01:46.990> compared

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
management was improved if we compared

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.130 
management was improved if we compared
to<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.970> 501<00:01:48.970> build<00:01:49.540> well<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> pop<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:52.140> think

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
to the 501 build well the pop I think

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.700 
to the 501 build well the pop I think
that<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:53.920> more<00:01:54.250> fast<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.240> fluid<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.900> it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
that it is more fast and fluid and it

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.680 
that it is more fast and fluid and it
runs<00:01:57.430> great<00:01:57.729> I<00:02:01.050> think<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.200> should<00:02:02.470> be<00:02:02.610> released

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
runs great I think it should be released

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:14.820 
runs great I think it should be released
