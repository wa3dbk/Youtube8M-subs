00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.109
 to build the car we are going to make 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.680
 choose one of our own company 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.680
 dow in my case 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.849
 and then they are vehicles and we choose some 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.520
 any seat so if 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.849
 you want expert in this particular you and 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.849
 good 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.080
 and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.080
 now let's go to tools let's see if 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 and we stick it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 who have chosen 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.390
 we turn them where we want and now 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:52.079
 we put ourselves in the whole community and we go 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 to willy tools and we go down 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 and the physicists and we put it in google 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 and here they will choose the strength of everything 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.480
 who want to put 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.260
 we put you well 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.070
 and creator of if they have it not like 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 you want or with 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 and change a march so then 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.720
 then the same will flee devised 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.520
 advanced you can control and choose 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 any all models is usually this 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.000
 and then we're going to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.430
 willy tours we will be able to advanced and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.050
 here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.050
 that is, it may be that the little city 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429
 a sound 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.710
 the networks we will see what goes on for 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.710
 go ahead when you see him 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.390
 past 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.430
 now in any case it is heavy 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.970
 to cancel it 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 nothing 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 I 'm going to sign him only for placement 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.410
 ah 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 well it's not secret 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.240
 then we have to connect the advance 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.670
 post controller we go to water and I do not 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.230
 I forgot to say it we give right click 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.280
 to the right bishop vote and then click 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.140
 right on the chair to bashir by 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.990
 advanced power now when one feels 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.330
 you win and it's going to turn green and it's not going to 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.760
 be warning 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.410
 which is working well now 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.270
 I can also say it back there 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.500
 to do one more procedure we can 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.000
 use that of physicists and we give testers 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.250
 a capon in which he wants I do not put him 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.550
 a lot of strength because if you are not going to leave 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.550
 quite 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.320
 they choose any good port does not matter 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.380
 that good for example we're going to put 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.340
 there is good and so on both sides 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.340
 to talk 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.060
 to and back and to bend good 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.770
 now let's go back to monitors let's go 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.640
 to 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.270
 and from advanced we choose is back 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.610
 let's see you 15 to the class 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.610
 this is would push for 5 d right 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.329
 this would be s 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.959
 and finally what would be for which 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.959
 left 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.049
 and so if they want they can take out 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.190
 the color at all 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.190
 doing tours 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.640
 color and low in these 20 why 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.640
 serves the crap 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.950
 gold can hide but not 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.060
 the look 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.060
 That would be all 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.060
 and ready guys with that let's go towards 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.060
 back where are we going to talk 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.270
 and they will have to be given more 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.270
 you 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.800
 but the new boy felt that in total 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.020
 of how is an airplane to put force on 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.930
 good rice guys that was all for today 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.430
 see you in the next video and you 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.430
 until next time
