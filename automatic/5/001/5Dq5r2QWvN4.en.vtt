we<00:04:16.770> have<00:04:16.890> regular<00:04:17.549> dice<00:04:17.760> six<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.960> dice

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:20.689 
we have regular dice six out of dice

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.719 
we have regular dice six out of dice
we<00:04:21.689> have<00:04:22.049> powers<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.919> abilities<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.580> I

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
we have powers and abilities this I

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.830 
we have powers and abilities this I
guess<00:04:23.879> kind<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.120> goes<00:04:24.210> over<00:04:24.330> things<00:04:24.629> like<00:04:24.719> I

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
guess kind of goes over things like I

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.050 
guess kind of goes over things like I
was<00:04:24.930> talking<00:04:25.020> my<00:04:25.169> wholesome<00:04:25.439> can<00:04:25.650> fly<00:04:26.060> you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
was talking my wholesome can fly you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.670 
was talking my wholesome can fly you
know<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.300> some<00:04:27.479> only<00:04:27.750> walk<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.289> like<00:04:28.409> attack

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
know in some only walk and like attack

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.249 
know in some only walk and like attack
and<00:04:28.830> offense<00:04:29.069> and<00:04:29.310> all<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> guess

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
and offense and all that so I guess

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.790 
and offense and all that so I guess
that's<00:04:31.349> kind<00:04:31.439> like<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.710> quick<00:04:31.949> reference<00:04:32.189> god

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
that's kind like a quick reference god

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.730 
that's kind like a quick reference god
yeah<00:04:34.830> looks<00:04:35.159> like<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:36.199> know<00:04:37.199> this<00:04:37.620> will

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
yeah looks like that I know this will

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.459 
yeah looks like that I know this will
come<00:04:37.889> in<00:04:37.979> handy<00:04:38.099> because<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.870> know<00:04:40.139> I<00:04:40.169> won't<00:04:40.409> be

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
come in handy because I know I won't be

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:41.659 
come in handy because I know I won't be
able<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.710> remember<00:04:40.919> all<00:04:41.129> the<00:04:41.219> different<00:04:41.310> moods

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
able to remember all the different moods

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.089 
able to remember all the different moods
so<00:04:41.939> that<00:04:42.090> will<00:04:42.240> definitely<00:04:42.360> come<00:04:42.689> in<00:04:42.780> handy

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
so that will definitely come in handy

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.290 
so that will definitely come in handy
different<00:04:44.099> scenario<00:04:44.520> rules<00:04:44.879> I<00:04:45.000> guess<00:04:45.060> that

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
different scenario rules I guess that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.249 
different scenario rules I guess that
makes<00:04:45.479> it<00:04:45.599> worth<00:04:45.719> a<00:04:45.810> little<00:04:45.900> bit<00:04:45.990> more<00:04:46.139> like

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
makes it worth a little bit more like

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.540 
makes it worth a little bit more like
you<00:04:46.289> go<00:04:46.500> like<00:04:46.680> we<00:04:46.770> have<00:04:46.889> like<00:04:47.039> points<00:04:47.430> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
you go like we have like points and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.959 
you go like we have like points and
everything<00:04:48.800> that's<00:04:49.800> pretty<00:04:49.979> cool<00:04:50.159> so<00:04:50.849> it's

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
everything that's pretty cool so it's

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.029 
everything that's pretty cool so it's
kind<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.150> making<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.509> so<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.719> Yugi<00:04:52.229> alone<00:04:53.009> I

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
kind of making it so a Yugi alone I

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.209 
kind of making it so a Yugi alone I
guess<00:04:53.340> easier<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:55.680> would<00:04:55.889> definitely<00:04:56.159> come

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
guess easier that would definitely come

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.760 
guess easier that would definitely come
in<00:04:56.310> handy<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.689> these<00:04:57.689> I've<00:04:57.990> heard<00:04:58.349> are<00:04:58.620> like

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
in handy to these I've heard are like

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.399 
in handy to these I've heard are like
disaster<00:04:59.400> zones<00:04:59.819> like<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> map<00:05:00.479> certain

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
disaster zones like on the map certain

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.990 
disaster zones like on the map certain
parts<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.740> map<00:05:01.830> can<00:05:01.979> be<00:05:02.039> destroyed<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:02.939> you

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
parts of the map can be destroyed so you

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.390 
parts of the map can be destroyed so you
place<00:05:03.270> these<00:05:03.479> on<00:05:03.689> it<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.930> believe<00:05:04.169> yeah<00:05:05.069> there's

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
place these on it I believe yeah there's

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.740 
place these on it I believe yeah there's
like<00:05:05.550> different<00:05:05.729> things<00:05:05.879> to<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:06.419> smoke

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
like different things to like smoke

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.679 
like different things to like smoke

blocking paths and stuff looks pretty

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.360 
blocking paths and stuff looks pretty
cool<00:05:12.560> it's<00:05:13.560> cool<00:05:13.740> how<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.889> give<00:05:14.069> you<00:05:14.129> so<00:05:14.250> much

cool it's cool how to give you so much

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.170 
cool it's cool how to give you so much
stuff<00:05:14.639> well<00:05:15.479> I'll<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.199> fill<00:05:16.379> out<00:05:16.819> these<00:05:17.819> I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
stuff well I'll just fill out these I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.659 
stuff well I'll just fill out these I
think<00:05:18.300> like<00:05:18.629> Adams<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.050> you're<00:05:19.439> monsters<00:05:20.340> can

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
think like Adams you you're monsters can

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.779 
think like Adams you you're monsters can
actually<00:05:20.909> throw<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:22.009> also<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> think<00:05:23.370> they<00:05:23.639> are

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
actually throw and also I think they are

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.019 
actually throw and also I think they are
used<00:05:24.120> as<00:05:24.360> tokens<00:05:24.839> as<00:05:25.080> well<00:05:25.639> so<00:05:26.639> that's<00:05:26.759> kind<00:05:27.000> of

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
used as tokens as well so that's kind of

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.499 
used as tokens as well so that's kind of
cool<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.810> last<00:05:28.770> part<00:05:28.979> we<00:05:29.159> have<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:30.360> believe

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
cool and last part we have is I believe

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.939
