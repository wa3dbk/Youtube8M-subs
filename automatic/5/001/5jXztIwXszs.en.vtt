00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
easier on myself so I don't have to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.760 
easier on myself so I don't have to
actually<00:01:46.970> spin<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> wrench<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.870> can<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.560> spin

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
actually spin the wrench I can just spin

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.740

the<00:01:48.920> spin<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.400> crank<00:01:49.670> once<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.120> get<00:01:50.300> there<00:01:50.540> and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the spin the crank once I get there and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.780 
the spin the crank once I get there and
