 emotional feelings and moods are 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.610
 often related to color perception 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.950
 through color understood as 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.680

 situations describes places and people 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.820
 the expressiveness of each color with his 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.260
 it strengthens the energy it releases 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.620
 to be in the eyes of the beholder 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.420
 intoxicating and engaging reaching 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.449
 our unconscious stimulus 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.699
 emotion, ideas, thoughts and feelings 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.580
 of the artist come to life on the canvas 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.720
 through the gesture the sign 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.720

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.790
 ivo stazio is an interpreter of the la color 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.640
 force of expressionism manifests itself 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.740
 in the color scheme of his paintings 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.100
 realistic memory landscapes for 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.420
 that describe the reality that surrounds it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.620
 abstract because they express its essence 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.740
 more intimate Bolognese by birth ivo 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.230
 stazio since childhood shows a strong 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.080
 predisposition to design all this 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.270
 who sees and appropriates color 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.220
 inherent in everything 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.620
 painting then becomes a path to 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.500
 communication thanks to which you can 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.570
 tell that solid bond with his 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.940
 land 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.720
 here then the images speak and 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.960
 describe moments of everyday life 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.910
 hills illuminated by sunlight 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.550
 busy ring roads of cars and people 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.250
 channels factories the monuments that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.190
 stand out among the red roofs of the city 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.090
 with its dark corners and narrow streets 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.840
 of the center places spaces and landscapes to him 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 dear with the look of the capture artist 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.530
 every frame that becomes on the canvas 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.950
 sign 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 stain of color volume matter in the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.560
 mind processes these images absorbs and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.150
 it evokes every emotion that becomes 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 chromatic expression 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.330
 if the landscape in art is space 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.910
 ideal to represent nature on 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.150
 landscape of ivo station is real for 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.740
 certain aspects but it is above all 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.260
 unreal because it is formed in the unconscious 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.740
 in the most rational part of the mind 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.930
 of the artist the essential geometries 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.840
 in fact they lead towards the abstract towards 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.370
 the informal as an expression of the mind 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.860
 in which the absolute value color 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.340
 and then the paintings full of are born 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.280
 color where yellow gives heat and light 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.620
 spontaneity represents curiosity 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.860
 for what is new the desire for 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.770
 freedom green indicates hope e 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.440
 attachment to life represents the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.739
 nature to which we tend to reach 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.750
 self-confidence the blue brings instead 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.390
 to the closure in oneself to the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.180
 reflection is the color of the night of 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.930
 rest of meditation and then there is the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.090
 red above all that is red 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.670
 movement and the color of affectivity e 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.510
 of emotions unleashed with energy 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.480
 vital that becomes suggestion and dream 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.750
 when it tends to purple or abandonment to the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.709
 quiet when adding white 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.709
 it turns pink 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.409
 the canvas worked with lime and sand sands 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.500
 glues mixed with the pigment becomes 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.849
 rough and color-soaked spatula 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.069
 leaves equally rough lumpy marks 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.730
 the matter takes coarse and fleshy 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.949
 form generates figures even sketchy 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.519
 little recognizable in their physicality 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.590
 real but expression of a reality and of 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.360
 a familiar landscape that is well 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.889
 rooted in mind and heart 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.710
 the artist's experience of color is 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.500
 subjective and subjective becomes then 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.740
 to the interpretation of the work each 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.840
 color conveys a different feeling 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 mixes and fuses irrationality together and 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.090
 passion but that's what matters 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.270
 find the emotion in the subject 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.270
 color
