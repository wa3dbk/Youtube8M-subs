00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
let me show you the products that I'm
using<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.669> inside<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.540> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
using in what it has inside so you can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.350 
using in what it has inside so you can
get<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:33.989> understanding<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.710> why<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.730> protein

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
get an understanding of why it's protein

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
get an understanding of why it's protein
or<00:00:36.719> why<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:38.059> moisturizing<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:40.010> first<00:00:41.010> off

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
or why it's moisturizing so first off

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
or why it's moisturizing so first off
I'm<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.390> packs<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:43.920> gonna

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I'm gonna use two packs but I'm gonna

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'm gonna use two packs but I'm gonna
use<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.670> half<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.510> maybe<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:46.079> thirds

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
use like half of it or maybe one thirds

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
use like half of it or maybe one thirds
of<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.550> large<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.750> first

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of it because it's very large the first

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
of it because it's very large the first
pack<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.500> gonna<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> olive<00:00:50.910> oil

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
pack that I'm gonna use is the olive oil

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.560 
pack that I'm gonna use is the olive oil
re<00:00:51.620> petition<00:00:52.620> pack<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.270> say<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
re petition pack and this I would say is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
re petition pack and this I would say is
unlike<00:00:54.930> protein<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.640> hydrolyzed

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
unlike protein because it has hydrolyzed

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
unlike protein because it has hydrolyzed
collagen<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.859> protein<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
collagen in it and that is a protein and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
collagen in it and that is a protein and
then<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> has<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:00.420> silk<00:01:00.840> amino<00:01:01.140> acid<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.770> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
then it has also silk amino acid in it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.750 
then it has also silk amino acid in it
it<00:01:02.550> also<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:03.030> other<00:01:03.270> extracts<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.760> other

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it also has other extracts and other

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.950 
it also has other extracts and other
oils<00:01:06.390> such<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:07.130> camel<00:01:08.130> mal<00:01:08.310> extract<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> soya

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
oils such as camel mal extract and soya

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.030 
oils such as camel mal extract and soya
bean<00:01:10.260> oil<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.720> next<00:01:13.049> pad<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.740> use

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
bean oil the next pad that I'm gonna use

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
bean oil the next pad that I'm gonna use
is<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> Argan<00:01:14.970> incense<00:01:15.770> intensive

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
is the Argan incense intensive

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
is the Argan incense intensive
conditioning<00:01:17.340> treatment<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> from

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
conditioning treatment this is from

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.580 
conditioning treatment this is from
cream<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.740> nature<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.259> will

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
cream of nature and this has I will

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
cream of nature and this has I will
consider<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> also<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> protein<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
consider this also a protein because it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.300 
consider this also a protein because it
has<00:01:25.259> hydrolyzed<00:01:26.189> wheat<00:01:26.880> protein<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.979> also

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
has hydrolyzed wheat protein and it also

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450 
has hydrolyzed wheat protein and it also
has<00:01:29.670> hydrolyzed<00:01:30.390> wheat<00:01:30.720> starch<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.280> also

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
has hydrolyzed wheat starch and it also

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.569 
has hydrolyzed wheat starch and it also
has<00:01:32.820> some<00:01:34.369> oils<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.759> olive<00:01:36.000> oil<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.579> that's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
has some oils like olive oil and that's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
has some oils like olive oil and that's
about<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.960> kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> same<00:01:40.619> thing

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
about it so it's kind of the same thing

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.679 
about it so it's kind of the same thing
as<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.460> other<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> next<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
as the other one then next I'm going to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.450 
as the other one then next I'm going to
use<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.060> intensive<00:01:48.060> fortifying<00:01:48.899> treat

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
use is the intensive fortifying treat

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.800 
use is the intensive fortifying treat
fortifying<00:01:50.460> hair<00:01:50.790> conditioning<00:01:51.329> treatment

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
is um full of oils and extracts it has

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.380 
is um full of oils and extracts it has
olive<00:01:59.540> oil<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.990> has<00:02:00.079> coconut<00:02:00.350> oil<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:02.210> also

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
olive oil it has coconut oil and it also

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.290 
olive oil it has coconut oil and it also
has<00:02:02.780> hydrolyzed<00:02:03.380> Silkk<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.790> also<00:02:05.119> has<00:02:05.750> um

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
has hydrolyzed Silkk and it also has um

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.949 
has hydrolyzed Silkk and it also has um
what<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.569> mint<00:02:09.229> extract<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.099> engine

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
what is that mint extract and engine

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.350 
what is that mint extract and engine
ginseng<00:02:11.959> extract<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:15.910> these<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:17.209> be<00:02:17.330> like

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
ginseng extract so these will be like

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.930 
ginseng extract so these will be like
proteins<00:02:18.019> I<00:02:18.290> guess<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.910> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
proteins I guess but I think what I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.640
