00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.230
 there is a constant complaint that they all have 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 the guys from managua talk about the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 collective urban transport service 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 from the capital are unsafe 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.949
 drivers have no conscience to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.720
 treat us and they are also scarce and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.529
 regular this was what they told us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.529
 its users 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.740
 surely we already realized that 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.620
 apart from opening the bus ticket what 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.970
 we will pay with rechargeable cards 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.190
 this to avoid the large ranks in 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.990
 the stops and also so that there is a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.450
 better control of the money that is charged 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 by passage but the kids who travel 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.290
 by bus every day to go to school 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.070
 belief and other problems besides 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.260
 this saturates a lot and sometimes in those 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.390
 things happen to us that we touch the traumas 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.330
 women until today turn us around 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 always always in the bags but it 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.579
 happen because 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 they rise too much we go that the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.689
 authorities expect to see that because they do not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.689
 we may go to a few winds 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.820
 because we do not want to move forward and maybe 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.549
 We are at the edge of the entrance to 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.590
 leaving is true the courtesy of the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.780
 drivers in many cases does not exist 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.000
 but according to the cooperative directors 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.470
 they are already working to improve it and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.130
 they also have demands for 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.130
 authorities 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 and what should be done is that the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.390
 trauma gives us more units than the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 police will ride agents dressed in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.230
 civil truth one brings a forward for 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.319
 make the driver feel more secure 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 Safer to see does not matter that they are mounted 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.400
 the thieves but they will grab him there 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.500
 the kids do not just complain about them 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.150
 they are also aware they have their 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 own suggestions to improve the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 quality of service 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.250
 I would readjust a bit what is the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.349
 schedule system because to avoid 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.750
 that the buses at the peak rate begin 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:48.200
 to get more people the fuller 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.180
 the bus made some personal buses 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.910
 for students as some 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.209
 private schools that there are always buses 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.340
 to leave a tour and 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.250
 then that would be good then 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.020
 solutions that bring more transportation already 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 because too many people can the city 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.120
 there is not much transportation to also that 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 the police get more 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.160
 to help more than anything in the protection 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.380
 of each person 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.960
 The truth is that the quality does not pulse if 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.700
 has improved because they have been 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.740
 replacing all the scrap that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.870
 we had before but as they told us 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.970
 These kids still have a lot to do 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.970
 so we can travel comfortably and safely 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.060
 you
