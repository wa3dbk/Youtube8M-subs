00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
that I'm not just over a month ago I had

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
that I'm not just over a month ago I had
some<00:00:23.160> coursework<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.539> course<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
some coursework in for my my course and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
some coursework in for my my course and
I<00:00:25.859> spent<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.210> entire<00:00:27.480> week<00:00:27.720> doing

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I spent that kind of entire week doing

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
I spent that kind of entire week doing
that<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:28.800> why<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> did<00:00:29.130> making<00:00:29.279> videos

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that and that's why I did making videos

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.089 
that and that's why I did making videos
that<00:00:29.580> week<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.119> didn't<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that week I didn't go down too well so I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.639 
that week I didn't go down too well so I
was<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.420> feeling<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:34.079> making

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
was kind of not feeling like making

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.280 
was kind of not feeling like making
videos<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.399> doing<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.570> that's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
videos or really doing much so that's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
videos or really doing much so that's
why<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> hadn't<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.800> made<00:00:37.890> any<00:00:38.010> videos<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
why I hadn't really made any videos and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
why I hadn't really made any videos and
I've<00:00:38.910> kind<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.239> let<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> slide<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> since

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I've kind just let it slide and since

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
I've kind just let it slide and since
then<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.309> felt<00:00:41.700> motivated<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.239> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
then not really felt motivated to do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240 
then not really felt motivated to do
much<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.350> hopefully<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:43.950> make<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250

much but I'm hopefully now we make you
some<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.460> videos<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:45.030> least<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.629> once<00:00:45.899> a
