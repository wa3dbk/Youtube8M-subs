one<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.630> viewers<00:00:30.989> and<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
one of my viewers and I think this is a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.939 
one of my viewers and I think this is a
very<00:00:32.940> very<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.480> cool<00:00:33.780> figure<00:00:34.170> man<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
very very very cool figure man this is

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.070 
very very very cool figure man this is
bad<00:00:35.370> ass<00:00:35.699> this<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> actually<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> figure<00:00:36.900> that's

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
bad ass this is actually a figure that's

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.840 
bad ass this is actually a figure that's
not<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.650> people's<00:00:37.949> top<00:00:38.250> 10<00:00:38.519> Marvel

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
not a lot of people's top 10 Marvel

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.350 
not a lot of people's top 10 Marvel
Legends<00:00:39.180> lists<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.080> it<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.589> a<00:00:41.070> badass<00:00:41.790> figure

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
Legends lists but it is a badass figure

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.270 
Legends lists but it is a badass figure
and<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
and it's I think it's one of those that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.189 
and it's I think it's one of those that
just<00:00:44.339> misses<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> cut<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.750> 10<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
just misses the cut for the top 10 but

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.170 
just misses the cut for the top 10 but

see it has that peg right there he has a
peg<00:01:09.000> hole<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> back

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
peg hole in the back

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
peg hole in the back
the<00:01:10.740> articulation<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:11.880> pretty

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the articulation on this thing is pretty

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
the articulation on this thing is pretty
cool<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.450> loosen<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.259> twisting

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
cool you just loosen it up by twisting

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.929 
cool you just loosen it up by twisting
right<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> could<00:01:14.490> tighten<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
right here and then you could tighten it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120 
right here and then you could tighten it
into<00:01:15.240> position<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.470> stays<00:01:16.680> pretty<00:01:16.860> well

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
into position and it stays pretty well

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
into position and it stays pretty well
sometimes<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.820> things<00:01:17.880> break<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.990> be

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sometimes these things break they can be

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
sometimes these things break they can be
brittle<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.640> just

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
brittle but you know you could just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
brittle but you know you could just
articulate<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.140> these<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.829> points<00:01:23.070> then

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
articulate it on these two points then

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
articulate it on these two points then
you<00:01:23.369> could<00:01:23.549> rotate<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.840> well

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you could rotate it right here as well

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.260 
you could rotate it right here as well
and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> hole<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.909> where

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and then it has a hole in the back where

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
and then it has a hole in the back where

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
angel figure but the wingspan on this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.739 
angel figure but the wingspan on this
guy<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.819> don't<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.569> a<00:01:57.630> little

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
guy I don't know I think it's a little

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.050 
guy I don't know I think it's a little
bigger<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.590> mean<00:01:58.889> they're<00:01:59.130> angled<00:01:59.549> completely

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
bigger I mean they're angled completely

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.849 
bigger I mean they're angled completely
differently<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.139> it's<00:02:01.319> kind<00:02:01.499> of<00:02:01.530> hard<00:02:01.679> to

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
differently so it's kind of hard to

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.800 
differently so it's kind of hard to
gauge<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.789> this<00:02:02.909> guy<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.539> know<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
gauge but I think this guy you know this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.959 
gauge but I think this guy you know this
does<00:02:04.079> take<00:02:04.319> up<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.859> bit<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.159> space<00:02:05.639> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
does take up a little bit more space you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.449 
does take up a little bit more space you
know<00:02:06.209> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.959> gotta<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.409> into<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> detail<00:02:08.280> of

box<00:06:18.820> is<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:20.140> other<00:06:20.320> way<00:06:20.500> so<00:06:20.560> that<00:06:20.860> their<00:06:21.130> flap

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
box is the other way so that their flap

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.680 
box is the other way so that their flap
downward<00:06:21.970> like<00:06:22.330> that

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
downward like that

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.570 
downward like that
