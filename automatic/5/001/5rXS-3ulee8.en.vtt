00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
Oh photo oh I think it's pretty good way

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.600 
Oh photo oh I think it's pretty good way
I<00:00:55.530> mean<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> poison<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> feel<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> be

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I mean the poison would it feel to be

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
I mean the poison would it feel to be
the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.180> still<00:00:57.510> fine<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.199> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the way but still fine this is just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
the way but still fine this is just
another<00:00:58.559> clip<00:00:59.010> where<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> guards<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.879> berserk

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
another clip where the guards go berserk

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
another clip where the guards go berserk
I<00:01:00.449> used<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.719> preserved<00:01:01.050> art<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.949> guy<00:01:02.190> here

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I used a preserved art on this guy here

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.320 
I used a preserved art on this guy here
and<00:01:04.280> he<00:01:05.280> doesn't<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.090> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and he doesn't what to do so he just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
and he doesn't what to do so he just
jumps<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> ladder<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.170> dies<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.950> then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
jumps off the ladder and dies and then

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.649 
jumps off the ladder and dies and then
like<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.939> fun<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.510> use

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
like that's not very fun so I use

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
like that's not very fun so I use
another<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.260> guy<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.180> up

the ladder I don't know why they went up
in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> first<00:01:14.310> place<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.090> causes<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.540> guy

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
in the first place but he causes one guy

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.410 
in the first place but he causes one guy
to<00:01:15.780> jump<00:01:16.080> off<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> die<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.970> bet<00:01:18.330> he's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to jump off and die and then he bet he's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
to jump off and die and then he bet he's
telling<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> guy<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> hell<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:20.040> my
