00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
working at all on my phone so I couldn't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
working at all on my phone so I couldn't

give you an overview then anyway let's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
give you an overview then anyway let's
jump<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.809> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
jump right in so you can see here the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
jump right in so you can see here the
lockscreen<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.770> has<00:00:53.180> five<00:00:54.180> shortcuts<00:00:54.930> as

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
lockscreen now has five shortcuts as

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
lockscreen now has five shortcuts as
opposed<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> four<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.309> also<00:00:56.640> coming<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
opposed to four this is also coming to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
opposed to four this is also coming to
the<00:00:57.210> Galaxy<00:00:57.690> Note<00:00:57.840> 2<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the Galaxy Note 2 and I think this is a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
the Galaxy Note 2 and I think this is a
nice<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.120> feature<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> icons<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
nice little feature the icons are a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.340 
nice little feature the icons are a
little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.800> smaller<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> obviously<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.910> can

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
little bit smaller and obviously you can

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.520 
little bit smaller and obviously you can
edit<00:01:04.350> them<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.150> nice<00:01:06.600> feature<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
edit them but that's a nice feature that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.830 
edit them but that's a nice feature that
we've<00:01:08.310> seen<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> drop<00:01:09.659> down

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
we've seen as well now on the drop down

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.859 
we've seen as well now on the drop down
menu<00:01:10.110> obviously<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> jellybean<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.750> we

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
menu obviously this is jellybean so we

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.880 
menu obviously this is jellybean so we
have<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.470> ability<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.780> hide<00:01:15.890> notifications

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
have the ability to hide notifications

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
have the ability to hide notifications
and<00:01:17.250> expand<00:01:18.060> them<00:01:18.180> using<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.720> finger

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and expand them using a two finger

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.789 
and expand them using a two finger
gesture<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:21.799> making

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
gesture so you can see there I'm making

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.359 
gesture so you can see there I'm making
the<00:01:23.479> emails<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.140> email<00:01:25.409> preview<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.189> go

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the emails the email preview come and go

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.690 
the emails the email preview come and go
and<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.299> rid<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.549> will

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and if I get rid of this here this will

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330 
and if I get rid of this here this will
automatically<00:01:30.150> expand<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.470> hide

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
automatically expand and then I can hide

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760 
automatically expand and then I can hide
it<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:34.290> said<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.650> a

Sandwich ability to drag apps on top of
each<00:05:47.010> other<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:47.250> think<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:47.640> has<00:05:47.730> something<00:05:48.030> to

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
each other I think it has something to

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.540 
each other I think it has something to
do<00:05:48.330> with<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:49.290> motion<00:05:50.190> enabled<00:05:52.220> feature<00:05:53.220> here

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
do with the motion enabled feature here

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.480 
do with the motion enabled feature here
so<00:05:53.700> you<00:05:53.790> can<00:05:54.000> drag<00:05:54.630> icons<00:05:55.170> between<00:05:55.740> the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
you can see this is definitely been

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.910 
you can see this is definitely been
buttered<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:00.780> what<00:06:01.230> I<00:06:01.260> mean<00:06:01.410> by<00:06:01.470> that<00:06:01.560> is
