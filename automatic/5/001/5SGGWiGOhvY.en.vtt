00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.809
 this money will be shown by the citizens of the eastern area 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 I had bought a right-to-live society 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.630
 percent 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.460
 I wish it so 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 percent since 2000 none of that because I had to do it in a hurry 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.710
 under what happened 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.929
 Pedro 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.489
 as the beast is a word that had a little optimism 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.489
 and the truth 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.340
 his serve 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 the wife and her fliers and 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 I know what you think the skirt 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.420
 from here I also like me I like but 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 in what did happen what you say 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.520
 I put flyers 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.830
 circular 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.760
 words to this is an inner circle put to go 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.400
 i the problem is that i think that with hiv it is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.680
 but unfortunately they are only goods 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 in I think it's left I think they are a bit stiff 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.600
 that is, nothing that only shows a sample 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.030
 for that we make samples 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.400
 ain to tell us what we do not like 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.030
 nothing shaker I think I'm going to do another one with the other but for another fabric of 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 gangs that I have 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.600
 do one thing that I wanted to show you that I really liked how it was 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900
 so what did your opinion 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 yes the text 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660
 jump 10 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.229
 normally with votes in favor 10 18 motorcycle 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.649
 and the truth is that if the people entertain the whole working class world 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.940
 but this is another thing p 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
 favorable commotion we have to make sure we do not 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.210
 there is still some doubt of honesty and then for the moment the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.090
 the energy aie 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.980
 what I did 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.320
 series 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 Add 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.779

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.499
 polka dots but the picture is ground I think I like it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.589
 that is, nothing 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.979
 i 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.089
 and that I took out 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.659
 the one that nothing is what I really liked this fable almost more than any 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
 otherwise the combination of the picture with the mole 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.329
 but that gives a stick 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.779
 take out 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.059
