00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.959
 welcome to this video in this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.330
 video we'll see together how 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.820
 back up the directional game on the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.070
 framework and what are the mistakes to do 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.280
 not do in the assembly of the game of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280
 direction 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.600
 it is very important in advance of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.210
 prepare well for the material 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 clean and look when you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 ask the leadership game for 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 can better their recovery after in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 what order you need to insert the parts 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 firstly the cartridge of the bearing to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.190
 marbles and bevels here inside and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.670
 so you have to notice that on the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 fork 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 if there is a washer that is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.469
 beveled also so this part 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 come here to be able to turn you 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.390
 must then have a beveling that is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.030
 found on the top of this bearing to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.780
 marbles here that matches beveling 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.940
 which is inside this cash 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.309
 that you have to put on it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.229
 once this is inserted you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 must try to see that nothing 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.479
 rub on the fork here when you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 turn the frame will come so here and there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.970
 will then be the other part of the game 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 direction that will come by 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 above like this with the same system 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 of hazing here is the ball bearing 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 get in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.650
 the puck that comes to center the whole 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 is over the cap that comes 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 fix cover the headset with 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.909
 a small rubber seal for his 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.450
 sealing 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.460
 so that's the directional game will be 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 positioned like these here we go 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.950
 now insert these two parts into 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.770
 the framework to be able to put the game of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.740
 direction and after the fork 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 let's go as we have seen everything to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.640
 the hour we are going to hand this 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.619
 part here in the bottom of the frame as well 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.960
 than the other one at the top so you can 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.149
 possibly it's interesting and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.509
 important well clean the inside of the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.240
 frame with a degreasing product see 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.000
 with 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.650
 a sopalin you also clean the part 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
 that you are going to insert here 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 here you are going to postpone this to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 this place knowing that it will take 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.250
 force a little bit so that it fits 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.260
 so let's tap it on it's 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.960
 very very important not to spoil 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.090
 this part that is perfectly round 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.030
 otherwise this part would not fit again 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.010
 in the frame you would also risk 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.110
 to damage the frame so we will typed 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.230
 underneath with a hammer but we 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.570
 are going to swap interposed between the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.510
 piece and the hammer a part in wood 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.000
 you can use a clipboard or 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 any piece of wood so as to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.220
 it does not distort the part 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.230
 metallic that's here let's go 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.230
 I use a sleeve each time 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 of a wooden tool no matter I hold 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.910
 in fact my piece like this I put here 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.490
 the wooden object 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.310
 here it is calais and I type here 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.310
 gently and all around 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:25.880
 but when you see it comes back from 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:27.350
 roughly balanced way and that's it 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.480
 now the bottom of the directional game 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.760
 is inserted in the frame you see 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.020
 it's slightly deformed the handle of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.420
 this old brush but is 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.970
 absolutely not damage here the part 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.100
 metallic on the same principle we 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.220
 now let's insert the part of 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.680
 top of the management game so cleaned 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 actually this room is 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.970
 you can clean the inside of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:00.140
 frame with a brush possibly 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.840
 will be sopalin here we go we position 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.780
 this room above always the same 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.820
 same system does not damage by typing 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.850
 with the hammer 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.660
 we position a piece of wood and 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.450
 strike in a balanced way as an employee 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.239
 law we gently tap the game of 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.540
 direction is now back 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.740
 position it here we remove 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.509
 eventually 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.919
 the little messes here we go 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.380
 now put a little bit of 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.690
 green fat on the inside of the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.460
 ball bearing inside the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.800
 piece here that's how it's inside 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.699
 of the ball bearing party that will come 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.590
 rub against the fork and insert 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.599
 does ball bearings obviously in the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.720
 common sense ie beveling towards 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.520
 the top like these it's him who 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.009
 will receive the bottom of the fork 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.330
 the ball bearing that is in 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.849
 top him a little metal here 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.250
 which allows to center the pivot of the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.750
 fork in the middle of the directional game 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.449
 this part comes to be fixed as 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.050
 these the beveling week to the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.479
 down so as to come into the game of 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.659
 direction here you put a little bit 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.479
 of green fat as before 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:29.180
 go there we put inside here a 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:33.380
 little bit that's it we put on the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:38.800
 ball bearing like this to 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:42.110
 inside we do not use oil 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.120
 but from Greece we are positioning 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.229
 this part of the ball bearing this 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.190
 ball bearing in the top here that's it 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.849
 it is fixed 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.729
 we can also put a little bit of 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:06:01.520
 fat on the hood that will come here 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:04.520
 this is positioning this hood with a 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.479
 little bit of fat on the top of the game 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.699
 direction as here we can 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.930
 clean up what's past after you see 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.380
 that it turns perfectly 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.530
 we will now be able to insert the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.100
 fork here is this video on editing 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.930
 of the directional game 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.330
 is over we will see in a 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.640
 next video how to insert the oven 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.340
 and how to fix it with its gallows 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.340
 it was maximilien of the loan to the sun
