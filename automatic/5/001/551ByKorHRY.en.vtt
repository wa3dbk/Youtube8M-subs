 I'm around here this over here 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.130
 block it forces me to break my temple 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:34.440
 voucher worth voucher we break it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.910

 mislateros worth there is already we have 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 blocks I am happy now 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.400
 simply missing that man and already 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.240
 just happier in history and I do not 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.970
 I give several colleagues are team if 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.970
 they are effectively tim something 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 eye glares eye and you are and will come 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.420
 to me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.540
 It does not come anymore as in the manzanita 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 and we're going to do the one about him 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.790
 this 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 a game achieved this week a little 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 tense 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800
 eye eye 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.869
 of posture quite the stupor that I have 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.869
 In the peak 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.330
 of companions 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 but this man 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.240
 because he insisted so much I do not understand it 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:47.189
 I want a little more blocks 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.159
 there is something similar but that is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.380
 putting the word well I say that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.970
 let's go on I do not know why there are so many 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.860
 ting but the fact is that there is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.909
 two eggs wicha goes the site and is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.200
 point to catch him and there are people worth 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.780
 I think the most profitable thing is going to follow the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.479
 half guys call me crazy but 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 I think the most profitable will be going to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.950
 half is putting eggs to that man 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.950
 I think they are happening from me a bit 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.000
 voucher voucher 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.010
 this comes to me from pearls 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.970
 ready I came from pearls good eye that I 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.790
 I can put in the middle guys 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.030
 it did not arrive I do not carry it now yes I think now yes 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.260
 effectively 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.870
 this is the time to arm me until the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.720
 boots is the time to arm me up 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 the boots 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.069
 good vale has had because people 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.370
 he has what he is seeing for me 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.680
 eye is worth 512 worth 2 kings and I 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.700
 perfect is that I really liked the line 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.280
 of gas and the best move in there 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.799
 leisure time so the best played by 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.370
 each dolphin is going to fight between them and 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.900
 I'm going to stay here with roses 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.090
 that's what I think will happen 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.299
 another thing is that what I hope happens 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.299
 yes 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.700
 my bow marked this and for the moment I think 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.180
 that is not me my bow by god danny 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.920
 Boyle is worth an eye because from here we are 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.409
 and as a legacy but beware because 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.500
 falls since the futuristic style 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.720
 box can that the teacher is to say a 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940
 portento with the bow I'm a damn 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.680
 portento is worth in those two I do not know 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.190
 move because they have seen what there is a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.130
 with sung and more dates better yet 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:37.960
 for boys, it is worth 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.820
 are these two that are sticking to 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.340
 see if they hurt both a lot and the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.000
 last I get close with the bow 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 look if he did not get in there he went to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.760
 in voucher 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.860
 let's finish seeing what here 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.850
 it looks like little arrows that never come 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 wrong 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.700
 around them and I think we can already 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.430
 go for that man 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.769
 let's go for the islands because 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.670
 directly, it 's crazy, so 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.670
 we make 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.640
 clear clear I have it clear he wears 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 is aiming with the bow is pulling 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.370
 arrows there because it was still Spain and 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.330
 just in case it gives me a knowledge that I 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.620
 I understand the guy understands a little 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.949
 here make a bridge down here 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
 would be to gamble a lot would be play will be 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.400
 much to make a bridge around here but what 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.400
 I'm going to do because it's not good to play 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.160
 gives the arrow the activity and the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.289
 companions 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.770
 I will do 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:49.210
 and we are making arrows and we are there 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.210
 it's there 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.590
 eye mate look how you pass by 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.940
 the bridge 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.500
 the intention of the partner I discovered 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.690
 charged him and gave him boy gave him 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.690
 gave him the one that did give him a boy 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.430
 Ushuaia for Cape Town will mark the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.390
 partner is worth fine well 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.270
 let's do the bridge over 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.740
 the one on the bridge at the top is the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.700
 bridge or the snowball in your 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.700
 house that can also be worth 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.770
 a bit like bad title a little bit wrong 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.770
 I do not know about you but I 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.409
 we are going to have a safe bridge since 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.840
 I have a lot of block, so let's go 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.699

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.280

 eye eye eye that is up there the 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.230
 partner can not jump and the party is 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.230

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.590
 God
