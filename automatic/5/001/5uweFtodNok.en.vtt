expect from a Mac in terms of the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.549 
expect from a Mac in terms of the
solidity<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.450> terms<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> beautiful

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
solidity in terms of the beautiful

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.680 
solidity in terms of the beautiful
aluminum<00:00:38.160> base<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.850> solid<00:00:39.239> aluminum

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
aluminum base so this is solid aluminum

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.049 
aluminum base so this is solid aluminum
on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> base<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> without

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
on the base and but that is without

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
on the base and but that is without
compromising<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> expect<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> PC

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
compromising what you expect from a PC

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
compromising what you expect from a PC
so<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.120> i/o<00:00:45.300> options<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so it's got all the i/o options that you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520 
so it's got all the i/o options that you
require<00:00:46.890> such<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.370> USB<00:00:47.700> 3<00:00:48.090> even<00:00:48.570> eSATA<00:00:49.260> which

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
require such as USB 3 even eSATA which

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
require such as USB 3 even eSATA which
is<00:00:49.680> great<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.120> using

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is great because that's what we're using

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
is great because that's what we're using

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
to show you check this out so the apps

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.960 
to show you check this out so the apps
that<00:06:07.169> are<00:06:07.320> not<00:06:07.620> currently<00:06:08.130> focused<00:06:08.699> and<00:06:08.849> this

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
that are not currently focused and this

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.850 
that are not currently focused and this
is<00:06:09.090> going<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.330> help<00:06:09.479> it<00:06:09.690> manage<00:06:10.169> resources<00:06:10.530> in

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
is going to help it manage resources in

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.760 
is going to help it manage resources in
a<00:06:10.919> big<00:06:11.159> way<00:06:11.340> are<00:06:11.880> labeled<00:06:12.449> as<00:06:12.590> suspended<00:06:13.590> so

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
a big way are labeled as suspended so

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.770 
a big way are labeled as suspended so
that's<00:06:13.949> going<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.430> reduce<00:06:14.729> the<00:06:15.389> amount<00:06:15.419> of

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
that's going to reduce the amount of

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.469 
that's going to reduce the amount of
resources<00:06:16.320> that<00:06:16.470> they're<00:06:16.830> consuming<00:06:17.479> when

resources that they're consuming when

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.570 
resources that they're consuming when
it's<00:06:18.690> hiding<00:06:19.199> it<00:06:19.289> away<00:06:19.380> much<00:06:20.070> like<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.490> way

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
it's hiding it away much like the way
