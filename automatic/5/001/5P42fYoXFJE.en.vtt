okay<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.830> solar<00:00:05.100> project<00:00:05.759> I've<00:00:05.940> been

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
okay this is my solar project I've been

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.270 
okay this is my solar project I've been
using<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.870> sliding<00:00:07.140> last<00:00:07.500> door<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.859> had

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
installations I put in so I'm gonna make

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.849 
installations I put in so I'm gonna make
a<00:00:12.780> solar<00:00:13.469> panel<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:15.260> they<00:00:16.260> used<00:00:16.500> Diet

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
a solar panel out of that they used Diet

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
a solar panel out of that they used Diet
Mountain<00:00:16.949> Dew<00:00:17.220> cans<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.970> used<00:00:18.600> two<00:00:18.869> hundred<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
Mountain Dew cans I used two hundred and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650 
Mountain Dew cans I used two hundred and
eighty<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.830> them<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.130> together<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.630> a

bottoms off of each one of them this is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.990 
bottoms off of each one of them this is
the<00:00:28.650> rail<00:00:28.830> system<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.340> used<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> glue<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:29.939> all

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the rail system we used to glue them all

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580 
the rail system we used to glue them all
together<00:00:30.179> keep<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.869> flat<00:00:31.170> getting

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
together keep them all flat getting

together keep them all flat getting
lined<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:32.040> worked<00:00:32.579> out<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:32.910> good<00:00:33.739> actually

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
lined up worked out pretty good actually

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
lined up worked out pretty good actually
the<00:00:34.890> angle<00:00:35.219> iron<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.090> will<00:00:36.329> be

used later to hold up the collector from
the<00:00:39.899> outside<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.700> box<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the outside this is a box this one the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.819 
the outside this is a box this one the
few<00:00:48.629> things<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.989> did<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
few things I did have to go to the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.029 
few things I did have to go to the
lumberyard<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> materials<00:00:52.800> for

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
lumberyard to get with the materials for

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
lumberyard to get with the materials for
the<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> frame<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.699> collector<00:00:58.219> all

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the for the frame of the collector all

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.479 
the for the frame of the collector all
the<00:00:59.460> cans<00:00:59.730> drying<00:01:00.680> these<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.370> high

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the cans drying these just high

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
the cans drying these just high
temperature<00:01:02.879> RTV<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.379> it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
temperature RTV on that I think it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.780

rated 220 degrees the whole salt it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.350 
rated 220 degrees the whole salt it
drills<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> half<00:01:12.869> inch<00:01:13.140> hole<00:01:14.360> for

temperatures run about about 125 degrees
on<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.940> that's<00:03:04.150> from<00:03:04.450> about<00:03:05.220> noon<00:03:06.220> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
on this and that's from about noon to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.580 
on this and that's from about noon to
2:30<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.900> then<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.260> gradually<00:03:10.380> drops<00:03:11.380> off

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
2:30 and then it gradually drops off

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.250 
2:30 and then it gradually drops off
from<00:03:11.830> there<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.840> temperature<00:03:13.840> controller

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
from there a temperature controller

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.100 
from there a temperature controller
right<00:03:14.980> now<00:03:15.040> I've<00:03:15.250> got<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.550> set<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.810> come<00:03:16.960> on

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
right now I've got to set it to come on

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.830 
right now I've got to set it to come on
at<00:03:17.260> 82<00:03:17.680> degrees<00:03:17.710> and<00:03:18.490> shut<00:03:18.790> off<00:03:18.940> at<00:03:19.120> 8<00:03:19.270> I'm

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
at 82 degrees and shut off at 8 I'm

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.690 
at 82 degrees and shut off at 8 I'm
probably<00:03:20.050> going<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.320> bump<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.740> up<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.250> move

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
probably going to bump that up and move

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.050 
probably going to bump that up and move
it<00:03:21.850> up<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.090> 86<00:03:22.630> or<00:03:22.750> 87<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.770> come<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:24.520> 80

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
it up to 86 or 87 to come on and then 80

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.250 
it up to 86 or 87 to come on and then 80
degrees<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.780> shut<00:03:26.020> off<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:28.060> quick<00:03:28.780> look<00:03:29.020> at<00:03:29.230> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
degrees to shut off a quick look at a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.430 
degrees to shut off a quick look at a
material<00:03:29.650> list<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:32.020> about<00:03:32.140> it

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
material list and that's about it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.490 
material list and that's about it
good<00:03:32.620> luck<00:03:32.770> with<00:03:32.920> your<00:03:33.040> project
