 i have a cat

 get a dog 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.950

 german shepherd would labrador either 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 If you are all small, then something like

 yorkshire terrier 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.160

 weimaraner to weimaraner she is big 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.390
 small on such as well, in principle 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.630

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.480
 there bulldogs but one high 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.430
 but not powerful after the case here it is very 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.910
 beautiful gray and interesting to myself 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.010
 her eyes were originally blue 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.690
 and then in 1 1 with yellow 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.060
 shorthair and wool itself is not only 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.390
 very nice gray color similar 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.000
 such a large running mat is very 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.400
 pleasant to the touch after such a homely 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.220

 I have something I would like to imagine a raccoon 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.600
 why raccoons but because now they 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.490
 very fashionable and generally not so cool 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.380
 cool i would also like a monkey 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.810
 little monkey to very small 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.150
 dangerous because they can suffocate 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.640
 Type in the night Alina sign I heard me so 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.230

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.190
 wound up all the same animals because 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.450

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:53.940
