00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.350
 The extra curved turn plate is ideal for 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.450
 curved walls and ceilings throughout 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.309
 type of environments for its extreme 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.320
 flexibility allows you to adapt to 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.629
 innovative design projects with 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.700
 various forms the placement is 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.880
 practical and simple following them 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.690
 steps of the armed durlock system 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.090
 structure 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.980
 the stakeout of the surface is done 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.260
 using a laser or hand level 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.400
 with a mold will be copied on the wall the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.380
 curve figure designed 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 for the assembly of the structure 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 they use articulated or flexible sills 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.610
 If you use the traditional ones, 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.110
 they should make cuts in d in one of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.110
 the wings and the soul of the profile 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 the articulated hearth is placed copying 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.680
 the marks made with the curved mold 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.930
 and it is fixed to the wall 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.540
 it marks the place where the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.430
 teachers or ribs articulated these 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.260
 they settle for superior hearth 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.720
 vertical upright profiles 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.790
 reinforcement and durlock standard plates on 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770
 the laterals 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.020
 finally the soleras are placed 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 articulated in coincidence with the edge 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.509
 lower 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.700
 once the ribs are placed 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.890
 insert the necessary amounts of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.890
 according to the radius of curvature designed 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.530
 planted a sowing or mold is prepared 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.329
 according to the design of the curves it 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 place the plate on top of it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.310
 Turlock extra curve if it's a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.619
 radio external curvature plate 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.990
 should be moistened by lightly spraying 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.760
 the surface it will copy 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.280
 immediately the curvatures designed 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.470
 and then the extra shift plate is placed 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 curves already molded in coincidence with 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.400
 the uprights profiles aligning the and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.400
 screwed in traditional way 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 taken from meetings 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.320
 for the songs at different angles of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.580
 90 degrees paper tape is used with 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.580
 double metal strip 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.490
 for the case of curved broths 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 uses this same tape by cutting 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.020
 perpendicularly one of its laws 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.180
 to the center consecutively to 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 the effects of making it articulated 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.340
 or flexible and then the taken 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.950
 of joints with putty shift and ready to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.170
 use or quick dry in the same way as 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.880
 is done on the shift system until 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 the surface is apt to receive 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.490
 paint can finally be applied 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.920
 Turlock latex paint or any other 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.020
 type of termination 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.730
 The extra curved durlock plate is the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.860
 ideal solution for all types of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.050
 curved applications both in walls 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.630
 as ceilings its extreme 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.940
 flexibility allows to achieve all kinds of 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.160
 designs differentiating each one of your 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.500
 environments from here on 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.950
 creativity can flow with the best 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.950
 shades
