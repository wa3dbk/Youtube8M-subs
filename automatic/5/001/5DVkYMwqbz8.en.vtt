to 74 wheats and like two or three four
trees<00:00:42.510> um<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.309> did

trees um but what they what they did

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.490 
trees um but what they what they did
here<00:00:45.300> let<00:00:45.480> me<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.629> rid<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> these<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
here let me get rid of some of these is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.670 
here let me get rid of some of these is
they've<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.960> they've<00:00:48.960> nerfed<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
they've actually they've nerfed it in a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.639 
they've actually they've nerfed it in a
good<00:00:49.829> way<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.610> uh<00:00:51.020> I<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.289> know<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
good way now so uh I don't know if that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
good way now so uh I don't know if that
if<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> phrase<00:00:53.280> carries<00:00:54.059> over<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
if that phrase carries over if that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
if that phrase carries over if that
works<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.680> growing<00:00:56.039> wheat<00:00:56.309> only<00:00:56.610> takes

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
works but now growing wheat only takes

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.400 
works but now growing wheat only takes
two<00:00:57.180> pieces<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> bone<00:00:57.719> meal<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.260> see

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
two pieces of bone meal as you can see

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
two pieces of bone meal as you can see
here<00:00:58.649> sometimes<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> takes<00:00:59.520> three<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.390> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
here sometimes it takes three but I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.139 
here sometimes it takes three but I
think<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> most<00:01:00.930> part<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.410> takes<00:01:01.649> two

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
think for the most part it takes two

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
think for the most part it takes two
maybe<00:01:03.149> three<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.809> three<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
maybe three let's go with three the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
maybe three let's go with three the
first<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.309> know<00:01:05.369> why<00:01:05.519> let's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
first one was to I don't know why let's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.310 
first one was to I don't know why let's
go<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.820> three<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:10.200> one

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
go at one was to that was three that one

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
go at one was to that was three that one
was<00:01:10.470> too<00:01:10.650> okay<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.240> appears<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.810> two

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
was too okay so it appears that it's two

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.050 
was too okay so it appears that it's two
or<00:01:13.290> three<00:01:13.619> pieces<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.189> bone<00:01:14.400> meal<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.850> grow

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
or three pieces of bone meal to grow

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.109 
or three pieces of bone meal to grow
your<00:01:15.090> wheats<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:16.200> trees<00:01:16.909> let's<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
your wheats and then trees let's see I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
your wheats and then trees let's see I
don't<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.960> trees<00:01:19.380> it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
don't think that's in the way trees it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.450 
don't think that's in the way trees it's
gonna<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.659> four<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.979> six

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
gonna be one two three four five six

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.109 
gonna be one two three four five six
seven<00:01:24.270> okay<00:01:24.630> maybe<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> way

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
seven okay maybe this is in the way

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
seven okay maybe this is in the way
let's<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:28.579> and<00:01:29.579> let's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
let's get this out of the way and let's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
let's get this out of the way and let's
let's<00:01:30.119> read<00:01:30.390> let's<00:01:30.420> replant<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.320> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
let's read let's replant that's just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.550 
let's read let's replant that's just
test<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:32.970> air<00:01:33.150> tree

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
test this out you get out air tree

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
test this out you get out air tree
nobody<00:01:34.560> loves<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.130> okay<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.840> two

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
nobody loves you okay here we go one two

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.539 
nobody loves you okay here we go one two
three<00:01:38.159> four<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.890> seriously<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.250> many<00:01:41.280> was

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
three four but seriously how many was

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
three four but seriously how many was
that<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> bunch<00:01:42.500> anyways<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that that was like a bunch anyways it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889 
that that was like a bunch anyways it
appears<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.009> trees<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> lot

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
appears that trees are they take a lot

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
appears that trees are they take a lot
more<00:01:45.930> boma<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> grow<00:01:46.619> okay<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.040> too<00:01:47.180> very

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
more boma to grow okay that was too very

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.819 
more boma to grow okay that was too very
odd<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.049> sporadic<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
odd so I think it's just sporadic but

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.679 
odd so I think it's just sporadic but
anyways<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.850> biggest<00:01:51.060> thing<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.479> update

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
anyways the biggest thing in this update

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.710 
anyways the biggest thing in this update
is<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.170> snow<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:53.460> went<00:01:54.210> ahead<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.420> spawned

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
is the snow and i went ahead and spawned

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
is the snow and i went ahead and spawned
in<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.079> super<00:01:55.380> flat<00:01:55.590> world<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.159> with<00:01:56.310> all<00:01:56.520> snow

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
in a super flat world here with all snow

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
in a super flat world here with all snow
and<00:01:57.270> basically<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.350> new<00:01:58.560> crafting

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and basically there's a new crafting

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.459 
and basically there's a new crafting
recipe<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.909> snow<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.810> layer<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
recipe to get this snow like layer the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.499 
recipe to get this snow like layer the
top<00:02:01.680> layer<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> goes<00:02:02.280> across<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.360> could

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
top layer that goes across you could

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.749 
top layer that goes across you could
previously<00:02:03.780> only<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> snow

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
previously only get if you had a snow

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.910 
previously only get if you had a snow
golem<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> snow<00:02:07.500> biome<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
golem or if you're in a snow biome and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.309 
golem or if you're in a snow biome and
it<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.160> snowing<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:09.239> now<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> take<00:02:09.780> three

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it was snowing but now if you take three

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.630 
it was snowing but now if you take three
snow<00:02:10.560> blocks<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> pattern<00:02:11.340> like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
snow blocks and a pattern like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
snow blocks and a pattern like
it's<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> give<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.300> six<00:02:12.660> blocks<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's going to give you six blocks of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
it's going to give you six blocks of
snow<00:02:13.260> or<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.100> guess<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.490> called<00:02:14.700> snow<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
snow or I guess is just called snow this

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.520 
snow or I guess is just called snow this
is<00:02:15.330> called<00:02:15.510> snow<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.170> called<00:02:16.319> snow

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
is called snow and this is called snow

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.780 
is called snow and this is called snow
they<00:02:16.680> didn't<00:02:16.860> make<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.130> separate<00:02:17.490> names<00:02:17.670> I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
they didn't make two separate names I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.730 
they didn't make two separate names I
hate<00:02:17.940> when<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.150> named<00:02:18.300> things<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> same<00:02:18.840> but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
hate when they named things the same but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.610 
hate when they named things the same but
anyways<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.819> like<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.000> little<00:02:21.620> layer

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
anyways this is just like a little layer

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
anyways this is just like a little layer
of<00:02:22.890> snow<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.340> called<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.610> layer<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.850> snow<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
of snow it's called a layer of snow and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
of snow it's called a layer of snow and
basically<00:02:25.380> what<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.459> can

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
basically what you can do now is you can

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.030 
basically what you can do now is you can
do<00:02:27.180> different<00:02:27.780> layers<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.650> different

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
do different layers and different

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920 
do different layers and different
heights<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.490> snow<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.360> what<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.630> gonna<00:02:30.720> head

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
heights of snow so what I'm gonna head

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.570 
heights of snow so what I'm gonna head
and<00:02:31.020> done<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.650> layer<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.490> we

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
and done here this is layer one then we

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.990 
and done here this is layer one then we
have<00:02:32.610> two<00:02:32.880> three<00:02:33.480> four<00:02:34.080> five<00:02:34.290> six<00:02:34.980> seven<00:02:35.520> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
have two three four five six seven and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.030 
have two three four five six seven and
eight<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.630> gonna<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.990> your<00:02:37.200> full<00:02:37.470> block<00:02:37.739> so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
eight is gonna be your full block so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.610 
eight is gonna be your full block so
basically<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.459> full<00:02:38.640> block<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.000> snow<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:40.260> gonna

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
basically a full block of snow is gonna

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.680 
basically a full block of snow is gonna
be<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.520> exact<00:02:41.819> same<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.390> we

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
be I think the exact same as this we

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
be I think the exact same as this we
grab<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.140> it's<00:02:43.560> gonna<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:44.459> so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
grab this it's gonna be right here so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.350 
grab this it's gonna be right here so
you<00:02:44.670> really<00:02:44.820> can't<00:02:45.000> tell<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> difference

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you really can't tell the difference

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600 
you really can't tell the difference
however<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.470> cool<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.250> use<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
however the cool thing is if I use the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.060 
however the cool thing is if I use the
pic<00:02:47.790> block<00:02:48.030> tool<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.800> going<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
pic block tool on this it's going to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.860 
pic block tool on this it's going to
tell<00:02:50.190> me<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.670> layered<00:02:50.970> snow<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
tell me that this is layered snow if I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.660 
tell me that this is layered snow if I
use<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.110> pic<00:02:52.260> block<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.550> gonna

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
use the pic block to on this it's gonna

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.949 
use the pic block to on this it's gonna
tell<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.360> block<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.780> snow

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
tell me that this is the block of snow

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.890 
tell me that this is the block of snow
so<00:02:55.560> um<00:02:55.890> basically<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.600> do<00:02:57.750> is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so um basically to do this all you do is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570 
so um basically to do this all you do is
you<00:02:58.019> take<00:02:58.050> here<00:02:58.350> let's<00:02:58.560> make<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.100> new<00:02:59.310> strip

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
you take here let's make a new strip

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000 
you take here let's make a new strip
here<00:03:00.050> basically<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.739> place

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
here basically to do this you just place

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.610 
here basically to do this you just place
your<00:03:02.220> snow<00:03:02.550> your<00:03:03.090> Laird<00:03:03.330> snow<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.140> then

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
your snow your Laird snow down and then

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.410 
your snow your Laird snow down and then
if<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.860> want<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> start<00:03:05.370> layering<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:06.000> top<00:03:06.060> of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
if you want to start layering on top of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.479 
if you want to start layering on top of
that<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.810> layer<00:03:07.019> again<00:03:07.250> or<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.340> can

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that you can layer again or you can

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.400 
that you can layer again or you can
layer<00:03:08.640> even<00:03:09.450> more<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.050> right<00:03:10.200> click<00:03:10.380> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
layer even more you just right click to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.190 
layer even more you just right click to
layer<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.160> easy<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.630> can<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.930> I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
layer it's really easy and you can go I
