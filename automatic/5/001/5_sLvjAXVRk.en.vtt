 teams as armenta was retired 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.059
 with that play in the pentagon 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.960
 so it was put out to sepúlveda ene efe 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.869
 episode after the day 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.729
 the response of motives before writing down 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.770
 precisely with the double of goals 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.350
 sepulveda and durango the career of the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 quiniela in the game this was in the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.580
 fifth entry when the devils 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.520
 they took advantage thanks to the extra base of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.060
 carlos sepúlveda the set of caborca 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.509
 he answered in the sixth inning 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.689
 thanks to this triple first connected 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.909
 by gerardo briones opening the episode 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.320
 when I was only one third in that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.000
 inning 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.370
 the addition of caborca that was 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 present in this game would come to norbert 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.170
 all that with the unstoppable producer 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 equaling thus the blackboard in this sixth 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 roll 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.910
 was placed one by one in play in the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 sixth episode after it would still come 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.120
 Carlos Valente with a double in this 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 inning to put reds in front 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.440
 well the valence that would respond with this 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.870
 hit 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.660
 far away by land of Victor Saints 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.150
 of a boat was picked up by Norberto of those 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.920
 quickly came to the thinker this 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.220
 moment because all the advantage of two 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 races for a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.020
 however in the seventh entry to the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.240
 Devils 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.620
 they would go to the front before this great 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.480
 This game's play could also be 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.510
 clear in the game the out in home and in the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.970
 shot of Carlos Sepúlveda for Carlos 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.980
 Hernandez who later would equal the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.320
 blackboard with this square can be 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.270
 left to the defense we saw and then 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.880
 of the offensive of four executives to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.970
 jose hernandez applying that moment of 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 tie for the pockets here equaled 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 the blackboard the set hermosillo with 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.820
 josé carlos hernández that connected the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.590
 quadrangular to life of an announcement 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.090
 previously with a double there is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.770
 the four-cornered hit by the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.930
 veracruzano receiver of the guided 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790
 pocket 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.280
 here is not equal to a blackboard what 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.379
 would be the beginning of a rally that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.620
 would mark the course of the game this error 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.520

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.290
 more of the set 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.110
 of the devils of Hermosillo that take 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 the advantage with this blunder and it would come 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.560
 later this snail error 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.240
 enza batazo de raúl pattern that allowed 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.190
 natural and durango the fourth that reflects 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.630
 the dessert was the race of triumph for 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.340
 the set of devils and both 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.440
 hits could be doubles for 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.450
 finish the game the element in those 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.950
