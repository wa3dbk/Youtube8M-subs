luckily the evil within wisely went this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.939 
luckily the evil within wisely went this
route<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:16.020> expect<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.680> few

route and you can just expect a few

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
route and you can just expect a few
choices<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> weapons<00:00:17.850> here<00:00:18.029> starting<00:00:18.990> off

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
choices of weapons here starting off

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.900 
choices of weapons here starting off
with<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> most<00:00:19.470> basic<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.400> revolver

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
with the most basic the revolver

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
with the most basic the revolver
although<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> don't<00:00:21.960> necessarily<00:00:22.109> start

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
although you don't necessarily start

although you don't necessarily start
with<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.490> revolver<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.510> realistic

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
with it the revolver is very realistic

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.870 
with it the revolver is very realistic
in<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> sense<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.949> has<00:00:25.980> slow<00:00:26.490> fire<00:00:26.849> rate

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
in the sense that it has slow fire rate

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480 
in the sense that it has slow fire rate
and<00:00:27.240> bad<00:00:27.539> recoil<00:00:28.080> making<00:00:28.830> things<00:00:29.070> harder<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and bad recoil making things harder to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.929 
and bad recoil making things harder to
kill

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
kill

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
kill
it<00:00:30.330> seems<00:00:30.630> very<00:00:30.929> unpredictable<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it seems very unpredictable and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.030 
it seems very unpredictable and
unreliable<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> next<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.829> the
