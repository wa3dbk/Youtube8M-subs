biceps by understanding what this glove
has<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> have

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
has to do with it you know I have

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
has to do with it you know I have
nothing<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.590> putting<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
nothing to do with actually putting it

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.500 
nothing to do with actually putting it
on<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.310> hand<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.270> understanding

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
on your hand it's about understanding

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.560 
on your hand it's about understanding
how<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.619> relates<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:21.000> different<00:00:21.390> types

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
how this relates to the different types

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.120 
how this relates to the different types
of<00:00:21.689> contraction<00:00:22.350> understanding<00:00:22.980> those

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
of contraction understanding those

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.040 
of contraction understanding those
contractions<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.000> more<00:00:24.600> importantly

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
contractions and more importantly

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.050 
contractions and more importantly
implementing<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.340> workouts<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
implementing them into your workouts so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
implementing them into your workouts so
that<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> most<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> them

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that you can get the most out of them

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
that you can get the most out of them
I'm<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> show<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.220> exactly<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> do

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I'm going to show you exactly how to do

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.080 
I'm going to show you exactly how to do
it<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.779> bicep<00:00:31.380> exercise<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.610> minute

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it on a bicep exercise in one minute

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790 
it on a bicep exercise in one minute
first<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> types<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> contractions

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
first of all the types of contractions

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
first of all the types of contractions
that<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.880> guys<00:00:35.969> were<00:00:36.149> training

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that we have if you guys were training

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
that we have if you guys were training
for<00:00:36.540> any<00:00:36.630> length<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.290> understand<00:00:37.710> our

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
for any length of time to understand our

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
for any length of time to understand our
concentric<00:00:38.460> contractions<00:00:39.030> isometric

concentric contractions isometric

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
concentric contractions isometric
contractions<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> eccentric<00:00:41.040> contractions

while<00:00:42.210> ideally<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
while ideally you don't want to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.569 
while ideally you don't want to
understand<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> difference<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
understand the difference you want to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
understand the difference you want to
implement<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.450> said<00:00:45.690> into<00:00:45.960> your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
implement them like I said into your

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
implement them like I said into your
workouts<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.309> isometric<00:00:48.149> contraction<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
workouts that isometric contraction we

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
workouts that isometric contraction we
know<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.950> force

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
know that's just when we have force

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
know that's just when we have force
generated<00:00:51.360> tension<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> muscle<00:00:52.469> but

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
generated tension in the muscle but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
generated tension in the muscle but
without<00:00:53.129> movement<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> joint<00:00:54.350> secondly

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
without movement at the joint secondly

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
without movement at the joint secondly
we<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> concentric<00:00:56.100> contraction

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
we have the concentric contraction

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
we have the concentric contraction
that's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.480> familiar<00:00:57.719> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that's the one we're all familiar with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's the one we're all familiar with
where<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.530> shorten<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.699> muscle<00:01:00.149> as

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
where we actually shorten the muscle as

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.560 
where we actually shorten the muscle as
we<00:01:00.750> move<00:01:01.410> through<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> range<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> motion<00:01:02.850> okay

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we move through the range of motion okay

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.759 
we move through the range of motion okay
so<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.899> shortening<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.589> you're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so you're shortening as you're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
so you're shortening as you're
contracting<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.519> generating<00:01:05.939> tension<00:01:06.270> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
contracting and generating tension in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
contracting and generating tension in
the<00:01:06.390> muscle<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.680> eccentric

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the muscle and then an eccentric

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.850 
the muscle and then an eccentric
contraction<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> tension<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> muscle<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
contraction is tension in a muscle with

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
contraction is tension in a muscle with
lengthening<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> exterior<00:01:12.600> load<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
lengthening because the exterior load is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
lengthening because the exterior load is
greater<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> force<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.820> can

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
greater than the force that we can

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
greater than the force that we can
generate<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> muscle<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.259> an

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
generate in the muscle so we have an

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920 
generate in the muscle so we have an
elongation<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.369> joint<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:18.180> here's<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
elongation on that joint now here's the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
elongation on that joint now here's the
deal<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.250> glove<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:21.000> of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
we are concentric ly because we have

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.080 
we are concentric ly because we have

that friction generated by the cross
bridges<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.690> what<00:02:35.290> does<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.440> all<00:02:35.590> mean<00:02:35.740> for

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.070 
bridges so what does that all mean for
us<00:02:36.280> here<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> means<00:02:37.300> if<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.510> want<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.870> take

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.249 

and<00:05:11.759> so<00:05:11.909> you<00:05:11.970> really<00:05:12.180> can't<00:05:12.479> decelerate<00:05:13.050> that

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
and so you really can't decelerate that

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.070 
and so you really can't decelerate that
anymore<00:05:14.099> now<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.849> any<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.780> say<00:05:15.930> well

anymore now for any of you that say well

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.300 
anymore now for any of you that say well
I<00:05:16.110> don't<00:05:16.199> have<00:05:16.379> a<00:05:16.409> big<00:05:16.620> machine<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:17.039> do<00:05:17.159> that

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
I don't have a big machine to do that

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.520 
I don't have a big machine to do that
with<00:05:17.490> all<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.360> got<00:05:18.509> to<00:05:18.599> do<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:19.080> hook<00:05:19.259> up<00:05:19.379> your

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
with all I got to do is hook up your

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.960 
with all I got to do is hook up your
bands<00:05:19.860> again<00:05:20.460> signal<00:05:21.389> them<00:05:21.479> up<00:05:21.599> work<00:05:22.409> on<00:05:22.620> them

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
bands again signal them up work on them

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.399 
bands again signal them up work on them
through<00:05:23.970> here<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:24.599> your<00:05:24.690> first<00:05:24.870> ones<00:05:25.139> and

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
through here for your first ones and

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.990 
through here for your first ones and
then<00:05:25.919> if<00:05:26.069> you<00:05:26.159> have<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.460> go<00:05:26.580> through<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.849> ice

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
then if you have to go through the ice

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.570 
then if you have to go through the ice
and<00:05:27.180> fire<00:05:27.240> for<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.690> eccentric<00:05:28.289> just<00:05:29.009> double

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
and fire for the eccentric just double

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.879 
and fire for the eccentric just double
them<00:05:29.699> up<00:05:29.789> so<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.569> have<00:05:30.690> extra<00:05:31.110> tension<00:05:31.319> all

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
them up so you have extra tension all

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.110 
them up so you have extra tension all
right<00:05:32.449> guys<00:05:34.219> could<00:05:35.219> take<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.520> about<00:05:35.699> two<00:05:36.000> and

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
right guys could take you about two and

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.999 
right guys could take you about two and
a<00:05:36.180> half<00:05:36.300> minutes<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.870> do<00:05:37.379> one<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.560> these<00:05:37.710> sets

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
a half minutes to do one of these sets

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.640 
a half minutes to do one of these sets
and<00:05:38.190> theoretically<00:05:38.819> some<00:05:39.569> would<00:05:39.750> say<00:05:39.990> you've

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
and theoretically some would say you've

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.409 
and theoretically some would say you've
gone<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.039> concentric<00:05:41.490> failure<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:42.060> go<00:05:42.300> an
