and of course remastered a few the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
and of course remastered a few the
models<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.049> well<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.860> start<00:01:11.040> things<00:01:11.220> off

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
models as well now to start things off

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
models as well now to start things off
it's<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.119> perfect<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.869> remastered<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's not the perfect of remastered is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
it's not the perfect of remastered is
that<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> texture<00:01:14.280> issues<00:01:14.580> there

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that a lot of texture issues there

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
that a lot of texture issues there
certain<00:01:15.210> buildings<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.810> well<00:01:15.840> won't<00:01:16.320> have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
certain buildings as well won't have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.960 
certain buildings as well won't have
rendered<00:01:16.890> interiors<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> half<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
rendered interiors or the half the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
rendered interiors or the half the
interior<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> walk<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
interior there but when you walk into it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289 
interior there but when you walk into it
you<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.070> literally<00:01:20.280> fall<00:01:20.400> straight<00:01:21.000> through

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you will literally fall straight through

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
you will literally fall straight through
the<00:01:21.390> ground<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> teleport<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:22.530> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the ground and have to teleport back up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
the ground and have to teleport back up
to<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> surface<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.640> pretty<00:01:23.850> weird<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to the surface which is pretty weird so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
to the surface which is pretty weird so
it's<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> perfect<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> remasters<00:01:25.740> but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's not the perfect to remasters but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's not the perfect to remasters but
it's<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:27.030> early<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:28.560> map

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's very very early right now for map

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.260 
it's very very early right now for map

up<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> Malibu<00:01:48.299> Club<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.750> unfortunately

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
up the Malibu Club which unfortunately

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950

you could say fully rendered for the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.469 
you could say fully rendered for the
interior<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> couldn't<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.119> walk

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
interior so you couldn't actually walk
