00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:13.137
441 is one more siteswap

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:14.950
that will help a lot in the future

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:16.400
the only new thing on it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.567
is the throw '1'

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.894
a rapid transfer from one hand to the other

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.700
practice this throw and notice the difference between

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.870
throwing 1

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.168
and throwing 3

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:37.584
The trick is done with 2 parallel throws

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:38.931
one after the other

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:40.845
and one "throw 1"

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:50.646
try starting with 3 throws

00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:53.402
and gradually add more throws 

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:56.165
until you're able to maintain 441 longer.

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:18.975
then,

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.936
practice starting from the cascade

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.847
and also search some variations

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:54.528
