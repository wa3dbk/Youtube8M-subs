by putting bits on them and that's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.500 
by putting bits on them and that's
another<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.240> so<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
was 212 coin profit 77 30 8 so 8 coin

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.410 
was 212 coin profit 77 30 8 so 8 coin
profit<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.720> 76<00:00:46.380> is<00:00:46.560> a<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.950> calling<00:00:47.280> profit<00:00:47.700> so

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
other fitness cards up add a minute they

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.659 
other fitness cards up add a minute they
go<00:05:46.360> for<00:05:46.539> 2k<00:05:47.020> though<00:05:47.259> but<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:47.979> price<00:05:48.310> will<00:05:48.639> go
