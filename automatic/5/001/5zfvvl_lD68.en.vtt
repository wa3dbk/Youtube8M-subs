which<00:01:35.369> were<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.700> Momo<00:01:36.180> wheel<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.750> had<00:01:37.020> which

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
which were on Momo wheel they had which

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
which were on Momo wheel they had which
was<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> flash<00:01:37.920> locking<00:01:38.340> wheel<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.270> looked

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
was like a flash locking wheel it looked

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
was like a flash locking wheel it looked
pretty<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.829> also<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.369> changed<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> gear

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.469 
ratio I think we put a 308 at the server
two<00:01:44.280> seven<00:01:44.610> eight<00:01:44.700> or<00:01:44.759> something<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.240> that

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
production models we did work like that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.130 
production models we did work like that
so<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.910> was<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> great<00:03:49.299> success<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.079> think

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
so that was a great success so I think

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.620 
so that was a great success so I think
we<00:03:50.410> probably<00:03:50.440> deal<00:03:51.329> 250<00:03:52.329> or<00:03:52.390> something<00:03:52.570> like

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
we probably deal 250 or something like

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.090 
we probably deal 250 or something like
that<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.840> don't<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.110> where<00:03:53.500> how<00:03:53.590> many<00:03:53.799> exactly

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
that I don't know where how many exactly

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.770 
that I don't know where how many exactly
someone<00:03:54.519> would<00:03:54.640> probably<00:03:54.940> remind<00:03:55.390> me<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.570> that

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
someone would probably remind me of that

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.810 
someone would probably remind me of that
