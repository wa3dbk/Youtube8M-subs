00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
haven't had the time to do it with this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.800 
haven't had the time to do it with this
one<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.830> particular

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
one in particular

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.630

so<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.990> hoops<00:02:58.230> here<00:02:58.560> are<00:02:58.740> actually<00:02:59.220> quite

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
so the hoops here are actually quite

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
so the hoops here are actually quite
flexible<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.900> worry

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
flexible so you don't have to worry

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.840

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.760 
about not being able to fit through
doorways<00:03:03.120> or<00:03:03.540> skinny<00:03:03.990> hallways<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.560> anything

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
like that it's also very good for

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.870 
like that it's also very good for
storing<00:03:06.960> because<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:08.400> kind<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
storing because you can really kind of

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.970 
storing because you can really kind of
like<00:03:09.060> rumble<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.630> up<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.080> throw<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.800> bag
