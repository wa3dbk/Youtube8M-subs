growing them together for two reasons

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.640 
growing them together for two reasons
gardening<00:01:15.830> should<00:01:16.340> engage<00:01:17.200> more<00:01:18.200> than<00:01:18.410> one

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
gardening should engage more than one

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.150 
gardening should engage more than one
sense<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:19.910> all<00:01:20.240> you're<00:01:20.690> doing<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:21.650> trying<00:01:22.010> to

grow things to eat it won't work the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.060 
grow things to eat it won't work the
garden<00:01:24.050> will<00:01:24.230> figure<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.590> out<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:24.980> will

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
garden will figure it out and it will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.580 
garden will figure it out and it will
stop<00:01:25.310> doing<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.730> so<00:01:26.390> we're<00:01:26.660> engaging<00:01:26.810> lots<00:01:27.410> of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
stop doing it so we're engaging lots of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.650 
stop doing it so we're engaging lots of
senses<00:01:28.040> here<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.580> we're<00:01:28.760> using<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.360> plant

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
senses here and we're using the plant

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.690 
senses here and we're using the plant
that<00:01:29.870> obviously<00:01:30.230> will<00:01:30.470> grow<00:01:30.740> together<00:01:31.160> brew

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that obviously will grow together brew

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.160 
that obviously will grow together brew
it<00:01:31.790> really<00:01:32.360> really<00:01:32.720> well

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
it really really well

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.070 
it really really well
so<00:01:33.980> our<00:01:34.430> peas<00:01:34.700> benefit<00:01:35.300> from<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.659> sweet<00:01:35.900> peas

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
so our peas benefit from the sweet peas

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.330 
so our peas benefit from the sweet peas
because<00:01:36.380> they've<00:01:36.530> got<00:01:36.710> more<00:01:36.890> scent<00:01:37.159> Lee

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
because they've got more scent Lee

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.940 
because they've got more scent Lee
attracts<00:01:37.670> more<00:01:37.880> insects<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.720> benefit<00:01:39.680> because

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
attracts more insects I benefit because

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.100 
attracts more insects I benefit because

with your winter meals and it's growing
in<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.240> herbaceous<00:02:46.570> border<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:48.070> what<00:02:48.790> it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
in your herbaceous border but what it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.930 
in your herbaceous border but what it
actually<00:02:49.120> does<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.560> combines<00:02:51.250> we're<00:02:51.670> starting

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
actually does it combines we're starting

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.870 
actually does it combines we're starting
to<00:02:52.000> combine<00:02:52.570> our<00:02:53.220> flowers<00:02:54.220> we're<00:02:54.520> starting<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
to combine our flowers we're starting to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.540 
to combine our flowers we're starting to
combine<00:02:55.270> our<00:02:55.480> vegetable<00:02:56.200> growing<00:02:56.440> into<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
combine our vegetable growing into a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.800 
combine our vegetable growing into a
holistic<00:02:58.210> whole<00:02:58.990> so<00:02:59.770> it<00:03:00.250> might<00:03:00.610> sound<00:03:00.970> chaotic

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
holistic whole so it might sound chaotic

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.100 
holistic whole so it might sound chaotic
but<00:03:02.470> out<00:03:02.740> of<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:03.010> chaos<00:03:03.310> comes<00:03:03.880> more<00:03:04.840> good

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
but out of that chaos comes more good

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.190 
but out of that chaos comes more good
for<00:03:05.320> both<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.310> real<00:03:06.580> synergism<00:03:07.420> one<00:03:07.870> plus

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
for both it's a real synergism one plus

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.550 
for both it's a real synergism one plus
one<00:03:08.440> equals<00:03:08.920> three<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:10.330> actual<00:03:10.870> total<00:03:11.260> is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
one equals three the actual total is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.770 
one equals three the actual total is
more<00:03:11.590> than<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> sum<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.640> parts<00:03:12.910> by

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
more than the sum of the parts by

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.930 
more than the sum of the parts by
growing<00:03:14.200> these<00:03:14.470> things<00:03:14.800> together<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.640> are

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
growing these things together you are

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.150 
growing these things together you are
gonna<00:03:16.180> get<00:03:16.390> far<00:03:16.810> far<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:17.200> than<00:03:17.650> growing<00:03:17.830> any

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
gonna get far far more than growing any

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.770 
gonna get far far more than growing any
of<00:03:18.430> them<00:03:18.640> singularly

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
of them singularly

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.199 
of them singularly
and<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.770> this<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.100> beautiful<00:03:21.850> example

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
and I think this is a beautiful example

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.720 
and I think this is a beautiful example
of<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.570> synergism<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.709> plants<00:03:24.220> benefit

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
of that synergism the plants benefit

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.580 
of that synergism the plants benefit
yeah<00:03:25.209> you're<00:03:25.570> not<00:03:25.660> gonna<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:26.140> show-quality

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
yeah you're not gonna get show-quality

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.130 
yeah you're not gonna get show-quality
sweet<00:03:27.130> peas<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:28.930> that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
sweet peas but if you really are that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.870 
sweet peas but if you really are that
concerned<00:03:29.290> about<00:03:29.590> show-quality<00:03:30.130> sweet<00:03:30.640> peas

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
concerned about show-quality sweet peas

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.820 
concerned about show-quality sweet peas
then<00:03:31.120> you'll<00:03:31.300> be<00:03:31.390> growing<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.170> called<00:03:32.650> let's

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
then you'll be growing so called let's

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.620 
then you'll be growing so called let's
show<00:03:33.190> sweet<00:03:33.790> peas<00:03:34.060> you'll<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.330> growing<00:03:34.570> a

show sweet peas you'll be growing a

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.210 
show sweet peas you'll be growing a
