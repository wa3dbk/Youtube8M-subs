that's<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.939> did<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> back

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that's what we did and then on the back

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.240 
that's what we did and then on the back
I<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.789> glued<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.300> some<00:00:27.650> firm<00:00:28.650> paper

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I I glued them on to some firm paper

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.540 
I I glued them on to some firm paper
keep<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.539> longer<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
keep them a little longer and so this is

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
keep them a little longer and so this is
how<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.759> play<00:00:33.000> our<00:00:33.030> game<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.140> turn

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
how we play our game actually we turn

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
how we play our game actually we turn
them<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.739> around<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.260> mix

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
them all around like this then we mix

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.130 
them all around like this then we mix
them<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:41.090> try<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> put<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.899> way

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.049 

so<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.350> easier<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> words<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so that's easier to see the words and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
so that's easier to see the words and
that<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.300> she<00:00:48.450> doesn't<00:00:48.570> learn<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.680> read<00:00:49.829> them

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that way she doesn't learn to read them

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.029 
that way she doesn't learn to read them
backwards<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.730> upside<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:51.500> as<00:00:52.500> well<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.860> our

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
backwards or upside down as well as our

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.680 
backwards or upside down as well as our
sounds<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.090> put<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> sounds<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.530> one

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
sounds so i put the sounds all in one

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
sounds so i put the sounds all in one
side<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.989> table<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.219> our<00:00:59.550> words<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
side of the table and our words on the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
side of the table and our words on the
other<00:01:00.239> side<00:01:00.510> basically<00:01:00.960> half<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> word

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
other side basically half of the word

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.969 
other side basically half of the word
has<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> half<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> picture<00:01:03.899> example<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
has the half of the picture example the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.120 
has the half of the picture example the
pig<00:01:05.220> half<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> pig<00:01:05.970> has<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.450> word<00:01:07.170> Pig<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pig half of the pig has the word Pig and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.760 
pig half of the pig has the word Pig and
the<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.850> half<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.140> pup<00:01:11.689> oops

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
the other half would have the pup oops

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
the other half would have the pup oops
upside<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> other<00:01:15.540> part<00:01:16.020> would

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
upside down and the other part would

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.700 
upside down and the other part would
have<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> puff<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.970> game<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> she

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
have the puff so our game is that she

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
have the puff so our game is that she
has<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.189> find<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.729> sound<00:01:21.770> but<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> she<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
has to find a sound but and she has to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.469 
has to find a sound but and she has to
look<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> word<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> starts<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:25.920> puff

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
look for the word that starts with puff

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.399 
look for the word that starts with puff
puff<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.810> pig<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:30.409> learning

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
puff for pig so this is a good learning

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
puff for pig so this is a good learning
to<00:01:31.710> read<00:01:31.920> game<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.720> learn<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
to read game you don't just learn your

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
to read game you don't just learn your
sounds<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:34.799> she<00:01:34.979> knows<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.310> her<00:01:35.460> sounds

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
sounds which she knows all her sounds

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
sounds which she knows all her sounds
but<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.299> she<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> look<00:01:36.960> further<00:01:39.200> for<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
but then she has to look further for the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
but then she has to look further for the
word<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.400> she<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> look<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.180> closely

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
word and she has to look very closely

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
word and she has to look very closely
for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> beginning<00:01:43.710> sound<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> good

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
for the beginning sound this is a good

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
for the beginning sound this is a good
practice<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.600> learning<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:48.320> spell<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.740> read

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
practice for learning to spell and read

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.600 
practice for learning to spell and read
the<00:01:50.340> beginning<00:01:50.820> sounds<00:01:51.329> whale<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.220> she<00:01:53.310> has<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the beginning sounds whale so she has to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.560 
the beginning sounds whale so she has to
find<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> wool<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.040> side<00:01:56.360> hey<00:01:57.360> Wayne

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
find the wool on this side hey Wayne

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.170 
find the wool on this side hey Wayne
then<00:01:57.920> she<00:01:58.920> gets<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> put<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> together<00:01:59.700> she

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
then she gets to put it together she

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
then she gets to put it together she
puts<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> walk<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:02.100> whale<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:04.130> if<00:02:05.130> she

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
puts the walk for whale and then if she

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.380 
puts the walk for whale and then if she
knows<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.270> she<00:02:06.479> says<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
knows it and she says it right we put it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.809 
knows it and she says it right we put it
together<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.370> turn<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> around

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
together and then we turn it around

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.570 
together and then we turn it around
again

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
again

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.330 
again
she<00:02:12.910> doesn't<00:02:13.210> really<00:02:13.330> know<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> words<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.340> turn

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
she doesn't really know the words I turn

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.070 
she doesn't really know the words I turn
it<00:02:15.460> around<00:02:15.550> again<00:02:16.060> now<00:02:16.300> she<00:02:16.360> knows<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.750> it's

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it around again now she knows that it's
