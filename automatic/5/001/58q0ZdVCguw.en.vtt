 Hello everyone, a fresh explanation today 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.549
 fresh for you but first demonstration 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:16.550
 effect or a deck of cards you 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.970
 I ask to touch a card 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 this perfect here 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.599
 we leave here at the top meanwhile I go to you 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.090
 present next object that is a 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.320
 wallets and we're going to open more 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.320
 forward e 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.859
 it's a pen 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.359
 with which he asks you to sign the card 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:50.829
 on the back ok the ferret will sign back 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:53.969
 on the perfect back you made a mark 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.799
 on your card to identify it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.350
 and now I want to show you what 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:03.750
 inside the wallet or a card 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.750
 signed by me with the laws magic room 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.819
 which as you can see this is a 10 of 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.119
 spades and this too now matches the 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.119
 explanation 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.210
 an aggression explanation of the effect 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.070
 the trick where statute is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.649
 when sticking to the back of the wallet 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.630
 on the part for peace c enters the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.939
 portfolio two thirds of the spouses e 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.500
 detrimental to the thesis fox long ago 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.500
 romanelli what normal shake 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.530
 games with wallets in the field pocket 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.940
 does not stick to the quagmire and inside a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.470
 deck of cards I buy the card 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.420
 signed of the exhibition of the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.380
 demonstration I could see and the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.890
 pen in the left pocket then here in 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.660
 top is the duplicate card you have 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.820
 just about wallets a 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.280
 expensive 10 of pippi is the same as 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 you have in the wallet like 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.620
 from the illusion of having 10 drawn then 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.190
 indeed touch any card for 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:11.030
 example, you don't do this here either 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.010
 turn the rest on top of the deck that 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.630
 now the wallet comes into play 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 say that you have to present a 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.570
 next object of the effect that the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.730
 owning a portfolio doing so 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.410
 I supported her a chemist knows runs 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.850
 on the deck 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.430
 in this way biadhesive will go to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.440
 take any card you have 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.960
 in the random card you have drawn 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 that you had to touch the viewer then 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.920
 that the water in the wallet supports it 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 on the deck and say you need one 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.580
 in fact the search was for the pocket 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040
 the ones you notice we had in 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 left pocket and that's it 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.989
 taking out the pen very much the leder 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.390
 take the sticker script out of the deck 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.920
 bring the real paper and then now 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.920
 the illusion will be who it is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.750
 you who ask yourself to sign it paper 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.340
 at the top of the spillway the fair 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.920
 mere convinced that it is the one he has 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 touched in the middle of the max while 10 pcs 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.870
 in this case prepared before 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.470
 at the start of the game you have it signed 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.420
 then pay attention to give up the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 wallet you take it open 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.540
 show that there is a card signed by 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.930
 you turn shown the buildings and 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 shown by certain carp of the spectator 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.650
