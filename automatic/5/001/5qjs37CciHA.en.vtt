best players in the NBA he still at a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
best players in the NBA he still at a
fantastic<00:00:54.629> season<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:56.629> don't<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.780> why<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
fantastic season I don't know why the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
fantastic season I don't know why the
sudden<00:00:58.859> change<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.809> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:00.989> starting

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
sudden change but you know I'm starting

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
sudden change but you know I'm starting
to<00:01:01.379> wonder<00:01:01.609> is<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> much

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to wonder is it because he has that much

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
to wonder is it because he has that much
confidence<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:05.040> his<00:01:05.159> game<00:01:05.430> maybe<00:01:06.360> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
confidence in his game maybe it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
confidence in his game maybe it's
overconfidence<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.920> he's<00:01:08.220> putting<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.670> shots

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
overconfidence and he's putting up shots

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
overconfidence and he's putting up shots
because<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.630> every<00:01:09.840> shot<00:01:10.049> he<00:01:10.170> puts<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.560> he

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
because I think every shot he puts up he

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
because I think every shot he puts up he
thinks<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:12.240> why<00:01:12.420> he<00:01:12.510> took<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
thinks is going in that's why he took it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.120 
thinks is going in that's why he took it
but<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.130> wonder<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.049> Kevin<00:01:16.049> Durant<00:01:16.439> took<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
but I just wonder if Kevin Durant took a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.510 
but I just wonder if Kevin Durant took a
realistic<00:01:17.759> approach<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.540> his<00:01:18.659> shot<00:01:18.930> selection

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
realistic approach to his shot selection

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.390 
realistic approach to his shot selection
like<00:01:20.520> awayed<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.630> LeBron<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.920> see<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
like awayed like LeBron you see the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.300 
like awayed like LeBron you see the
Miami<00:01:23.759> Heat<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.479> mastered<00:01:28.310> coming

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Miami Heat have really mastered coming

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.800 
Miami Heat have really mastered coming
to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> table<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.540> shot

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to the table with a very good shot

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
to the table with a very good shot
selection<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:32.340> their<00:01:32.549> shot<00:01:32.790> selection

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
selection I like their shot selection

for<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> most<00:01:33.810> part<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.400> Kevin<00:01:35.400> Durant's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
for the most part and Kevin Durant's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.890 
for the most part and Kevin Durant's
shot<00:01:35.820> selection<00:01:36.570> has<00:01:37.020> me<00:01:37.409> concerned<00:01:37.670> I

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
shot selection has me concerned I

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.830

oklahoma city thunder's my second

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.569 
oklahoma city thunder's my second
favorite<00:01:44.670> team<00:01:44.850> next<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.369> bowls

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
favorite team next to the bowls

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.450 
favorite team next to the bowls
obviously<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.649> I'd<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.159> them<00:01:50.340> do

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
obviously and I'd like to see them do

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.630 
obviously and I'd like to see them do
good<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:52.890> Kevin<00:01:53.159> Durant<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
good and I think for Kevin Durant to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
good and I think for Kevin Durant to
take<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.970> next<00:01:54.149> step<00:01:54.360> he's<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> have

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
take that next step he's going to have

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
take that next step he's going to have
to<00:01:55.590> improve<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> shot<00:01:56.490> selection<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to improve that shot selection and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.840 
to improve that shot selection and
really<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.259> basketball<00:01:59.040> IQ<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> take

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
really use that basketball IQ to take

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
really use that basketball IQ to take
smarter<00:02:00.270> shots<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.380> game<00:02:01.560> will<00:02:01.710> become

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
smarter shots and the game will become

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
smarter shots and the game will become
easier<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.640> him<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:02.880> he's<00:02:03.119> making<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
easier for him I think he's making it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.950 
easier for him I think he's making it
too<00:02:03.659> hard

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
too hard

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
too hard
