faster<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.970> higher<00:00:30.510> than<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> normal<00:00:31.109> human

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

invisible so you've got to actually look

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170 
invisible so you've got to actually look
out<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.710> smite<00:00:41.070> differences<00:00:41.730> he<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.000> see

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
him he looks like sort of a ghostly
figure<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> yeah<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
figure and yeah you can see kind of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
figure and yeah you can see kind of
shades<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.230> looks<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> something<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
shades but it looks to be something that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
shades but it looks to be something that
you'd<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:47.969> coming<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> event<00:00:48.930> like

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you'd see like coming out of event like

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
you'd see like coming out of event like
a<00:00:49.710> sort<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> stuff<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.850> quite<00:00:51.090> hard<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a sort of stuff but it's quite hard to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
a sort of stuff but it's quite hard to
see<00:00:51.809> him<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.680> actual<00:00:53.100> events

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
see him and if there are actual events

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
see him and if there are actual events
in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> game<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.420> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
in the game and that's where some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
in the game and that's where some
problems<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.199> arise<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.980> think

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
problems can arise because you can think

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.709 
problems can arise because you can think
the<00:00:56.340> hidden<00:00:56.610> there<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.149> actually<00:00:57.329> isn't

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the hidden there but it actually isn't

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
the hidden there but it actually isn't
now<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.440> thing<00:00:58.469> I've<00:00:58.739> noticed<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:59.129> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
now one thing I've noticed about this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
now one thing I've noticed about this
mod<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> quite<00:01:00.510> different<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.899> other

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
mod is that is quite different for other

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
mod is that is quite different for other
mods<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.920> quite<00:01:02.280> hard<00:01:02.670> like

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
mods is it is actually quite hard like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
mods is it is actually quite hard like
even<00:01:03.480> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.439> through<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.769> tutorial

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
even when you do go through the tutorial

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
even when you do go through the tutorial
it<00:01:05.460> doesn't<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:05.970> explain<00:01:06.299> fully<00:01:06.720> how<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it doesn't really explain fully how to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
it doesn't really explain fully how to
do<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.369> stamina<00:01:08.580> bar

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
playing is the hidden and it takes quite

becomes<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.930> hidden<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> person<00:01:29.100> who<00:01:29.130> did

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
becomes the hidden is the person who did

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.679 
becomes the hidden is the person who did
the<00:01:29.400> most<00:01:29.549> damage<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> hid<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> last

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the most damage to the hid in the last

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
the most damage to the hid in the last
round<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.890> doesn't<00:01:32.130> necessarily<00:01:32.369> mean

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
round now this doesn't necessarily mean

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
round now this doesn't necessarily mean
killing<00:01:33.210> them<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.750> example<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.290> could

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
killing them so for example I could

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
killing them so for example I could
shoot<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> hidden<00:01:35.070> heaps<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.369> times<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.880> get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
shoot the hidden heaps of times and get

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.120 
shoot the hidden heaps of times and get
his<00:01:36.119> health<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:36.659> let's<00:01:37.140> say<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> hundred<00:01:37.560> down

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
his health from let's say a hundred down

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.090 
his health from let's say a hundred down
to<00:01:38.460> 40<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.570> therefore<00:01:39.780> even<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.560> die<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to 40 so therefore even if I die and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.530 
to 40 so therefore even if I die and
someone<00:01:41.369> else<00:01:41.490> kills<00:01:41.729> him<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.030> still<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
someone else kills him I still get to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.760 
someone else kills him I still get to
become<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> hidden<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.409> did<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> most

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
become the hidden because I did the most

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
become the hidden because I did the most
damage<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> quite<00:01:45.090> hard<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> could

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
damage so it is quite hard and it could

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
damage so it is quite hard and it could
take<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.530> long<00:01:46.649> time<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> become

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
take you a really long time to become

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
take you a really long time to become
the<00:01:47.729> hidden<00:01:48.060> since<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.540> pretty

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the hidden since you actually pretty

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
the hidden since you actually pretty
much<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> kill<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> most

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
much have to kill him or do the most

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.030 
much have to kill him or do the most
damage<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.909> him<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.470> majority<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
damage to him now also in majority of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.830 
damage to him now also in majority of
these<00:01:53.130> servers<00:01:53.430> there's<00:01:54.030> quite<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> limited

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
these servers there's quite a limited

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
these servers there's quite a limited
amount<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.740> usually<00:01:56.520> there's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
amount of people like usually there's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
amount of people like usually there's
some<00:01:56.909> servers<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.509> only<00:01:57.659> five<00:01:57.960> people<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
some servers with only five people and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
some servers with only five people and
the<00:01:58.740> most<00:01:58.920> i<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.250> i've<00:01:59.369> seen<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> 10<00:01:59.939> there

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the most i think i've seen is 10 there

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.999 
the most i think i've seen is 10 there
may<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.170> seems<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> game

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
may be more but it seems to be a game

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
may be more but it seems to be a game
then<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.850> better<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.450> small<00:02:03.689> amount

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
then it's it's better with small amount

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.300 
then it's it's better with small amount
of<00:02:04.020> people<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.619> don't<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:04.890> want

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
of people because you don't really want

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
of people because you don't really want
a<00:02:05.549> whole<00:02:05.909> heap<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.270> people<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
a whole heap of people and it's just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
a whole heap of people and it's just
going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.259> make<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.560> game<00:02:07.740> last<00:02:07.950> longer<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
going to make the game last longer and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.230 
going to make the game last longer and
longer<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
longer because the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.820 
longer because the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
actually finding the hidden because yeah

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.870 
actually finding the hidden because yeah
you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.340> close<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you can see if it's really close to you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.280 
you can see if it's really close to you
and<00:02:33.120> there's<00:02:33.300> no<00:02:33.450> war<00:02:33.690> blocking<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and there's no war blocking it you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.570 
and there's no war blocking it you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
obviously know that the hidden is in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
obviously know that the hidden is in
that<00:02:35.760> range<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.690> do<00:02:36.870> choose<00:02:37.110> some

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that range but if you do choose some

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.690 
that range but if you do choose some
special<00:02:37.710> equipment<00:02:37.800> there's<00:02:38.220> some<00:02:38.370> options

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
special equipment there's some options

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
special equipment there's some options
like<00:02:38.970> adrenaline<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.630> makes<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.170> obviously

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
like adrenaline that makes you obviously

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.780 
like adrenaline that makes you obviously
run<00:02:40.740> fast<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> certain<00:02:41.460> amount<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.670> time

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
run fast for a certain amount of time

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.190 
run fast for a certain amount of time
and<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.330> stuff<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.720> basically

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and all that kind of stuff and basically

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.900 
and all that kind of stuff and basically

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.280 
as your stamina bar lets you so you
should<00:03:15.000> probably<00:03:15.240> try<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.660> find<00:03:15.900> something

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
should probably try and find something

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.470 
should probably try and find something
that<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.950> sit<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.820> wait<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.210> for<00:03:18.390> your

stamina bar to get back up because

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.170 
stamina bar to get back up because
there's<00:03:20.280> probably<00:03:20.490> gonna<00:03:20.580> be<00:03:20.700> nothing<00:03:21.000> worse

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
there's probably gonna be nothing worse

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.030 
there's probably gonna be nothing worse
than<00:03:21.390> hanging<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.900> wall<00:03:21.930> above<00:03:22.500> someone<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
tutorial because it's quite hard to work

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.610 
tutorial because it's quite hard to work
out<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:39.330> ledges<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.930> should<00:03:40.110> land<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.470> in

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.350 
out what ledges you should land on in
the<00:03:40.680> tutorial<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.220> yeah<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.910> no<00:03:42.090> biggie

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
the tutorial but yeah it's no biggie

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.880 
the tutorial but yeah it's no biggie
just<00:03:42.450> sort<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.110> learned<00:03:43.290> where<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.620> need<00:03:43.770> to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
just sort of learned where you need to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.320 
just sort of learned where you need to
lay<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.310> wait<00:03:44.430> for<00:03:44.580> your<00:03:44.670> stamina<00:03:44.910> bar<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
lay in and wait for your stamina bar to

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.090 
lay in and wait for your stamina bar to
reset<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.990> yeah<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.680> remember<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.040> when

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
reset so yeah just remember that when

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.530 
reset so yeah just remember that when
you're<00:03:47.370> playing<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.790> hidden<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.240> you<00:03:48.270> don't

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you're playing the hidden so you don't

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.760 
you're playing the hidden so you don't
automatically<00:03:49.050> think<00:03:49.350> you've<00:03:49.470> got<00:03:49.650> this

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
automatically think you've got this

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.370 
automatically think you've got this
infinite<00:03:50.280> supply<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.670> superpowers<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.230> yeah

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
infinite supply of superpowers so yeah

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.660 
infinite supply of superpowers so yeah
this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.680> definitely<00:03:52.770> one<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.340> harder

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
this is definitely one of the harder

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.220 
this is definitely one of the harder
mods<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.090> come<00:03:54.270> across<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:54.840> if<00:03:55.110> you're

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
mods that have come across so if you're

up for a challenge and a game that will

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
up for a challenge and a game that will
be<00:03:57.120> quite<00:03:57.270> scary<00:03:57.570> since<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.320> could<00:03:58.500> pretty

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
be quite scary since you could pretty

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.170 
be quite scary since you could pretty
much<00:03:58.740> died<00:03:59.010> from<00:03:59.220> anywhere<00:03:59.610> since<00:03:59.820> you<00:03:59.970> don't

much died from anywhere since you don't

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.850 
much died from anywhere since you don't
know<00:04:00.270> where<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.540> hidden<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.200> would

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
know where the hidden is I would

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.140 
know where the hidden is I would
definitely<00:04:01.980> recommend<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.970> download

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
definitely recommend that you download

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.240 
definitely recommend that you download
this<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.720> yeah<00:04:04.140> as<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.500> said<00:04:04.530> before<00:04:04.710> go

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
this and yeah as I said before go

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.680 
this and yeah as I said before go
through<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.550> tutorials<00:04:06.060> it'll<00:04:06.390> teach<00:04:06.510> you

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
through the tutorials it'll teach you

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.240 
through the tutorials it'll teach you
some<00:04:06.870> things<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.470> obviously<00:04:08.040> need<00:04:08.220> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
some things that you obviously need to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
some things that you obviously need to
learn<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.940> yet<00:04:09.390> just<00:04:09.630> make<00:04:09.810> sure<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.050> get

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
learn and yet just make sure you get

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.600 
learn and yet just make sure you get
good<00:04:10.230> at<00:04:10.470> trying<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.830> kill<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.130> hidden<00:04:11.490> as

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
good at trying to kill the hidden as

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.220 
good at trying to kill the hidden as
well<00:04:11.790> because<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.450> can't<00:04:12.690> kill<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.080> head

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
well because if you can't kill the head

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.630 
well because if you can't kill the head
and<00:04:13.350> then<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.650> can't<00:04:14.100> really<00:04:14.220> become<00:04:14.550> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and then you can't really become the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.280 
and then you can't really become the
hidden<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.390> being<00:04:15.570> said<00:04:15.690> though<00:04:16.080> there

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
hidden with that being said though there

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.080 
hidden with that being said though there
is<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> different<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.190> game<00:04:17.430> mode<00:04:17.729> where

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
is a different kind of game mode where

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.120 
is a different kind of game mode where
as<00:04:18.390> soon<00:04:18.660> as<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.960> die<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.229> become<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.859> hidden

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
as soon as you die you become the hidden

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.550 
as soon as you die you become the hidden
however<00:04:20.850> I'm<00:04:21.210> not<00:04:21.570> sure<00:04:21.780> how<00:04:22.020> many

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
however I'm not sure how many

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.200
