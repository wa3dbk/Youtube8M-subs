00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.690
 the home today from the hall arena 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.690
 looks at you 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.850
 23:28 that was the game goes on now 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.850
 but nothing 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.150
 confidently what do I think maybe that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.280
 last two minutes but otherwise was 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 today was a tough fight again 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.390
 many technical errors statements again 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 and that went alone over the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.230
 to hear without a fight 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.540
 be the phase in the game well again 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.950
 not so ran but then mr 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.829
 great fans behind us forward 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.390
 We were whipped and we were by the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.710
 born euphoria and have that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.710
 finished at the end sovereign 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.079
 we said we do it 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.990
 Game starts from new and have that 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.549
 We now implemented well in every game 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
 want that in the next match against 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.810
 saudi arabia continue and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.850
 then if possible with a best 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.439
 continue to pull a starting position 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.549
 Damn hard partie the boys in 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.719
 the bone is with us is the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.189
 President of the German Handball Federation 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.600
 Gentlemen farmers had them a bit 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.939
 sympathy with the troupe today as well as the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.979
 Argentines have gone to works no 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.539
 I do not feel sorry for the troupe 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.700
 because I know what they endure 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.649
 I can and I just think in the fight 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.450
 even stronger for us and it helps us 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.189
 also for the next games if you like that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.079
 endures a first half and in the 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.610
 second half of course then the 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.739
 answers have what the opponent has 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.869
 and I have to say that when I do that 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.599
 Team hit brilliantly 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.920
 especially thanks to an outstanding 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.020
 carsten lichtlein i believe that has us 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.679
 especially in the difficult time in the game 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.929
 held 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.939
 and then we are so slow to 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.220
 our game came on the outside 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.899
 One-on-one situations are over 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.489
 especially in defense much safer 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.350
 So in the first half 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.180
 hand on heart we are here so one 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.549
 was a little bit of us at dab time out 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.139
 that today the group victory I go 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.910
 assuming that was the group victory 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.560
 I think everything else would be a lie 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 as the team has occurred here 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.880
 must yes against Saudi Arabia 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.829
 I can say that I can do it too 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.290
 if I always have great respect for everyone 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.079
 adversary but you have to show everything now 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.239
 also around this fist one now 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.040
 actually can completely fall 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 for the group victory then also at the end 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.639
 to be able to reach the top 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.430
