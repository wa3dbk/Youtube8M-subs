00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.960
 raffle commemoration video with more 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.939
 of 5 thousand subscribers I came with a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.750
 a little bit of delay because I'm from 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.810
 vacation and I've been busy and up to date 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.720
 my screen in the account of 10 in 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 potter a lot of code to everyone to see 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.549
 my videos as always we are going to draw 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
 something we're going to do a little 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.960
 commemoration among all you see 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.510
 the video interested in participating that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.089
 It will be this time this time what is going to 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.369
 raffle is a giant card a letter 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.100
 folio size not if I have any here 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:00.440
 that what the photos do not put are 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.199
 some letters or there are some you will know are 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.570
 the letters size 15 x 10 I think it is 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.920
 with whole folio a sheet of paper but 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.850
 a little bit smaller it will be a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.260
 thing like that 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.480
 well well at the end of the video we 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740
 put some pictures that he sent me 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.420
 patrick of july- cards 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.009
 so you can see what is drawn since 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.259
 he has it and I do not have it if I were 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.600
 here would teach it is such a thing and a 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.100
 thing if the letter in question is to bury 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.810
 the guide the guide of bolgar everything is worth 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.250
 you do not usually find the letters in 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.570
 sale because they are very difficult to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.430
 find only those that have 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.530
 stores that buy many letters whose 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.030
 boxes and then some random that usually 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.240
 give the judges okay I have some 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.310
 out there but I do not know where these are 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.229
 letters are as I say very exclusive already 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.789
 that require a lot of purchases are going to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.950
 the distributors or also by 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.030
 arbitrate then it's a good 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.340
 opportunity to get one of 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 them that will be for the winner of 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.990
 draw this time of more than five thousand 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.819
 subscribers although it's called 5,300 that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.319
 draw of five thousand subscribers who 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.450
 do to win 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.399
 the card is valid to enter the draw of 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.959
 the big letter that obviously does not 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.869
 can play in the duel which will be the cta 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.100
 big puts it down just in case it's worth 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.350
 well below the description of the video 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.209
 as always you have a link docs google 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.099
 surely what you will see 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.090
 questionnaire a better form 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.650
 because this is not 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 why do you think what simply 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810
 although you see the video and you write already 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.300
 you enter the draw as I always say 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.370
 this description of the video the link of 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 two google to enter and fill in the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.300
 form I always repeat that only 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.910
 One form per person is allowed 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.980
 formal per user is worth no more than one 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.340
 only one because then they will cancel only 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.370
 the 61 then ordered them and that's it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.950
 you have until the 31st of August 31 of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.959
 August at 23:59 p.m. in Spain, not what 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.910
 leave for the last day to enter 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.030
 the draw of this giant card of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.709
 turn blackjack as you see in the title 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 down in docs google appears a 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.220
 form I have here a little 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440
 prepared jam where you will see above 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.099
 contest and potter etc is the five thousand 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.530
 subscribers 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.640
 the little review and you'll see a couple of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.920
 boxes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.150
 the first will put username in 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.230
 the username you have to put 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.060
 your username from youtube 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.410
 is worth the username with which you 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 can find your channel with which 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.849
 I can verify that the view I like 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.790
 be liked the video with which 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.980
 I can verify that the forum exists and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780
 then the second box is the email 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.489
 to be able to contact you in 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.470
 if you are in the person 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.220
 Graceful to take you the giant card 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.069
 to turn the guide of 10 x 15 or 13 18 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.250
 exactly what size does it have and then the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.450
 end of the video see some pictures I have 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.889
 simply username and 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.260
 email address and you send 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.810
 only once per person and up to 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 August 31, 259 you can participate in 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.950
 this draw of five thousand subscribers 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.129
 that as I say already are five thousand 329 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.190
 5 - 29 nothing more than if I hope that 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.319
 you may have luck I'll get around to it the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.459
 draw letter is only with what 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.110
 the eleven that has always given me good 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.629
 result is a coupon number that there is 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.750
 here in Spain that has five digits and 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.760
 if it does not pass more than a thousand if it does not happen more 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.769
 of a thousand although it may happen a thousand would be 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.260
 with the last three numbers if they were 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.760
 thousand 30 then we would have to look for another 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.949
 thing like a random dot org in 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.350
 direct or something like that but if they do not pass 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.449
 of 1,000 then it would be with the 11 11 point 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.130
 is and if it is a thousand, well, I would see 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.260
 how do I do it back in september 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.250

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.470
