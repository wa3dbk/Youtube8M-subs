00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.970
 paint is a saga of videogames created 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.330
 by core in 1992 it was a rpg 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.950
 set in the world of the Vikings 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.200
 at the beginning of the game you can see 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.390
 that jindal is a typical Viking 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.780
 barbarian who takes care of the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.050
 planet earth one day they steal the sword of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.690
 feijóo and the hammer of thor 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.540
 and now that it's just released movie 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.230
 because at the same time jindal is born in 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.230
 human form on earth 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.370
 endesa 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.820
 once he is older heimdall is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.110
 submitted to three arcade style tests 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.470
 good are typical tests of the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.240
 Vikings but like an arcade game 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.119
 the first is to cut into the braids in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.659
 a girl throwing axes a little bit 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.659
 more bastard 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.470
 the second set consists catch 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.470
 a boar you see, I would do better 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.460
 ah 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.969
 and the third martín is duel with others 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.969
 vikings 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 after playing arcade 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.000
 we discovered that jindal is destined to 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.030
 recover the weapons for that will have to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.560
 travel through the Nordic lands for that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.930
 we will have to catch some characters that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.550
 will help us in the adventure we will use 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.560
 carpenters warriors druids 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.690
 we will have to travel from an island to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.120
 another until finally get the weapons 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.730
 when we embark, we'll start 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.250
 a dungeon are not very detailed that 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.250
 let's say and besides there's no music 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.410
 we have to explore the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.830
 dungeon and end the sticks that 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.330
 let's find for that you have to touch them and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.130
 there they tell us if we face him or 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.160
 no but it's better that we prepare 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.100
 skip the tape combats are 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.920
 quite complex with the mouse you have to 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.360
 pick the weapon and attack quickly and 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.700
 you have to have better reflexes than the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.070
 enemy and the same happens to catch the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.140
 passions and the others why if not 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.140
 espabillas the game is running out right away 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.710
 no no no no 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.760
 [Music] 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:45.229

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:45.229
 [Music] 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.069
 in 1994 the sequel heimdall 2 arose and 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 this time they have worked hard 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.840
 as you can see it is a little more decent 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.400
 that the previous one more than a little 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.269
 too much a masterpiece in this 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.040
 Pindal sequel and steal must end 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.370
 Guíos plans of Insanity 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.069
 because you think it's called like that 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.469
 because it is loquito is that what you want 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.109
 make the world end full of chaos and 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.329
 we remissions prevent him from control 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.160
 of the game has also changed now 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.800
 makes the directions and he moves 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.500
 alone and so you can prepare with the mouse 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.660
 the attacks and also the fighting with 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.759
 the enemies are not focused battles 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.009
 in a specific place in the style of the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.830
 rpg is like final fantasy is among others 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.470
 they are batteries of free movement as in 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.180
 Kingdom Hearts or legend of zelda by 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.690
 Unfortunately genteel has not had more 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.690
