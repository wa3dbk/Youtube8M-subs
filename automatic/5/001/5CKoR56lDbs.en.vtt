00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and unfortunately things are not

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.500 
and unfortunately things are not
challenging<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.049> stages<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:07.860> linear

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
challenging these stages are very linear

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
challenging these stages are very linear
you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.710> chance<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you know you have little chance of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
you know you have little chance of
falling<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> stage<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.080> your

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
falling off the stage if you take your

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
falling off the stage if you take your
time<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> bananas<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.430> gonna

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
time and get the bananas you're gonna

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
time and get the bananas you're gonna
have<00:01:14.820> no<00:01:15.360> challenge<00:01:15.810> whatsoever<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.560> the

have no challenge whatsoever and the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
have no challenge whatsoever and the
reasoning<00:01:17.460> behind<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.750> tell<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
reasoning behind this is I can tell that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
reasoning behind this is I can tell that
this<00:01:19.320> game<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.710> originally<00:01:19.799> designed<00:01:20.670> to

take advantage of the gyro sensor in the
Nintendo<00:01:23.310> 3ds<00:01:23.509> because<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> levels<00:01:24.930> are

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
Nintendo 3ds because the levels are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
Nintendo 3ds because the levels are
designed<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.220> work<00:01:26.580> quite<00:01:26.790> well

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
designed to actually work quite well

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
designed to actually work quite well
with<00:01:28.110> moving<00:01:28.560> around<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> system<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.369> there

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
with moving around the system so there

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
with moving around the system so there
is<00:01:29.579> another<00:01:29.790> gameplay<00:01:30.240> mode<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> can

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
is another gameplay mode where you can

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
is another gameplay mode where you can
tilt<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.860> 3ds<00:01:32.460> around<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.150> move

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
tilt your 3ds around and actually move

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
tilt your 3ds around and actually move
the<00:01:33.630> monkey<00:01:33.869> balls<00:01:34.049> around<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the monkey balls around like that and it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
the monkey balls around like that and it
actually<00:01:35.189> works<00:01:35.549> quite<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
actually works quite well because the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
actually works quite well because the
levels<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.439> designed<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.829> railings<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
levels are designed with railings on the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
levels are designed with railings on the
side<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:39.270> less<00:01:39.479> likely<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.960> fall<00:01:40.200> off

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
side so you're less likely to fall off

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
side so you're less likely to fall off
the<00:01:40.500> edges<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> definitely<00:01:41.310> helpful<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the edges which is definitely helpful it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
the edges which is definitely helpful it
does<00:01:42.570> add<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.079> challenge<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
does add a bit more challenge to the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330 
does add a bit more challenge to the
game<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> mode<00:01:45.750> but

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
game when you do use this mode but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.080 
game when you do use this mode but
unfortunately<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.640> means<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
unfortunately that also means that you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.020 
unfortunately that also means that you
have<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> turn<00:01:48.570> off<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.899> 3d<00:01:49.680> mode<00:01:50.030> because

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
have to turn off the 3d mode because

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.880 
have to turn off the 3d mode because
helping<00:01:51.630> around<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> 3ds<00:01:52.200> does<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.680> work

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
helping around the 3ds does not work

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.789 
helping around the 3ds does not work
with<00:01:53.159> 3d<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> gets<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.119> blurry<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
with 3d on it gets very blurry and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
with 3d on it gets very blurry and
speaking<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> 3d<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.850> quite

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
speaking of the 3d I was actually quite

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
speaking of the 3d I was actually quite
nauseated<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> first<00:01:58.740> time<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> played<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
nauseated the first time I played this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.190 
nauseated the first time I played this
game<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.670> 3d<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> camera<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.689> very

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
game with 3d because the camera is very

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
game with 3d because the camera is very
sporadic<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.430> jumping<00:02:02.729> all

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
sporadic and it's you know jumping all

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
sporadic and it's you know jumping all
over<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.149> place<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.930> once<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.439> got<00:02:04.590> used<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
over the place but once I got used to it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
over the place but once I got used to it
this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> best-looking

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this is actually one of the best-looking

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.219 
this is actually one of the best-looking
3d<00:02:07.409> games<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.250> 3ds<00:02:08.580> launch<00:02:08.940> library<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
3d games on the 3ds launch library it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
3d games on the 3ds launch library it
you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.890> definitely<00:02:11.250> judge<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.670> distance

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you can definitely judge your distance

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.270 
you can definitely judge your distance
quite<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
quite well and it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.010 
quite well and it
overall<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.790> looks<00:02:14.030> really<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.750> great

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
overall just looks really really great

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.199 
overall just looks really really great
the<00:02:15.709> next<00:02:15.920> gameplay<00:02:16.220> mode<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.580> monkey<00:02:17.000> race

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the next gameplay mode is monkey race

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.790 
the next gameplay mode is monkey race
which<00:02:17.510> Believe<00:02:17.900> It<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.110> Not<00:02:18.140> had<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> lot<00:02:18.770> of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
which Believe It or Not had a lot of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.250 
which Believe It or Not had a lot of
potential<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.580> great<00:02:19.870> there<00:02:20.870> are<00:02:20.990> nine

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
potential to be great there are nine

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
potential to be great there are nine
different<00:02:21.290> courses<00:02:22.069> set<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.490> three<00:02:22.819> different

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
different courses set in three different

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.600 
different courses set in three different
settings<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.980> some<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.160> levels<00:02:25.459> are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
settings and some of the levels are

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.740 
settings and some of the levels are
designed<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.150> well<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:26.450> they

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
designed really well I think they

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
designed really well I think they
actually<00:02:27.110> compete<00:02:27.500> with<00:02:27.740> some<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.130> best

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
actually compete with some of the best

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.100 
actually compete with some of the best
Mario<00:02:28.819> Kart<00:02:29.090> design<00:02:29.420> tracks<00:02:29.720> out<00:02:29.930> there

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
Mario Kart design tracks out there

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.870 
Mario Kart design tracks out there
believe<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:30.680> not<00:02:30.830> they're<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.640> bad

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
believe it or not they're not that bad

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.240 
believe it or not they're not that bad
but<00:02:32.569> what<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:33.080> hampers<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.130> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
but what really hampers this is that it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.780 
but what really hampers this is that it
seems<00:02:34.550> rushed<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.450> controls<00:02:35.900> are<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.440> bad

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
seems rushed the controls are really bad

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.210 
seems rushed the controls are really bad
drifting<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.000> power<00:02:38.450> sliding<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.350> getting

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
drifting and power sliding and getting

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.460 
drifting and power sliding and getting
hit<00:02:40.430> by<00:02:40.640> weapons<00:02:41.209> from<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.569> other<00:02:41.720> racers<00:02:42.170> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
hit by weapons from the other racers and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.380 
hit by weapons from the other racers and
everything<00:02:42.739> it's<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.310> clunky<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.000> it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
everything it's just so clunky and it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.330 
everything it's just so clunky and it
slows<00:02:44.720> down<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.989> action<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.709> much<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.040> can't

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
slows down the action so much I can't

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.190 
slows down the action so much I can't
tell<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.550> how<00:02:46.700> many<00:02:46.760> times<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.330> tried<00:02:47.600> power

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
tell you how many times I tried power

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.080 
tell you how many times I tried power
drifting<00:02:48.620> around<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:48.950> turn<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:49.970> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
drifting around a turn just to have the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.580 
drifting around a turn just to have the
controls<00:02:50.510> fight<00:02:50.840> with<00:02:50.989> me<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.290> send<00:02:51.560> me

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
controls fight with me and send me

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.009 
controls fight with me and send me
flying<00:02:51.950> off<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.160> edge<00:02:52.750> unfortunately<00:02:53.750> as

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
flying off the edge unfortunately as

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.890 
flying off the edge unfortunately as
good<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> design<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.610> around<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.540> racing

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
good as the design is around the racing

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.809 
good as the design is around the racing
mode<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.380> controls<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.190> gameplay<00:02:58.400> just

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
mode the controls and the gameplay just

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.970 
mode the controls and the gameplay just
don't<00:02:59.060> live<00:02:59.239> up<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.830> unfortunately<00:03:00.830> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
don't live up to it unfortunately it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.040 
don't live up to it unfortunately it
will<00:03:01.310> get<00:03:01.519> stale<00:03:01.850> very<00:03:02.060> quick<00:03:02.420> being<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
will get stale very quick being that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.410 
will get stale very quick being that
there's<00:03:03.230> only<00:03:03.380> nine<00:03:03.709> different<00:03:04.100> tracks<00:03:04.420> there

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
there's only nine different tracks there

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.729 
there's only nine different tracks there
are<00:03:05.540> different<00:03:05.930> vehicles<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.620> can

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
are different vehicles that you can

things<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.579> one<00:03:22.610> game<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.299> they<00:03:24.110> rushed<00:03:24.410> it

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620

things in one game and they rushed it
out<00:03:24.739> if<00:03:24.950> they<00:03:25.250> had<00:03:25.400> made<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.910> The<00:03:26.269> Monkey

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570

Ball mode into one game it would have

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.080 
Ball mode into one game it would have
been<00:03:28.340> great<00:03:28.519> if<00:03:28.549> they<00:03:28.730> would<00:03:28.850> have<00:03:28.910> made<00:03:29.060> a
