a<00:04:03.790> light<00:04:04.480> tinted<00:04:05.470> moisturizer<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.610> little<00:04:07.269> bit

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
a light tinted moisturizer a little bit

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.600 
a light tinted moisturizer a little bit
of<00:04:07.480> bronzer<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.049> then<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.260> could<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.829> put

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
of bronzer and then you could just put

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.970 
of bronzer and then you could just put
this<00:04:09.760> on<00:04:10.000> as<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.690> highlight<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.739> would<00:04:11.860> be

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
this on as a highlight and it would be

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.660 
this on as a highlight and it would be
beautiful<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.989> never<00:04:14.950> tried<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.519> beach
