that's what I heard of this sport now I

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.660 
that's what I heard of this sport now I
think<00:04:08.140> they<00:04:08.440> trying<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.710> set<00:04:08.890> up<00:04:08.980> Canelo<00:04:09.340> vs

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
think they trying to set up Canelo vs

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.050 
think they trying to set up Canelo vs
cotto<00:04:09.930> when<00:04:10.930> I'm<00:04:11.050> being<00:04:14.250> nothing<00:04:15.250> they<00:04:15.820> trying

cotto when I'm being nothing they trying

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.479 
cotto when I'm being nothing they trying
to<00:04:16.150> get<00:04:16.330> set<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.870> Canelo<00:04:17.320> vs<00:04:17.620> cotto<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.280> that's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
to get set up Canelo vs cotto so that's

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.729 
to get set up Canelo vs cotto so that's
