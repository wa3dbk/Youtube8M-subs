00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
this way is so just things together

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.070 
this way is so just things together
better<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.520> do<00:02:52.050> nothing<00:02:53.050> just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
better but you can just do nothing just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.180 
better but you can just do nothing just
like<00:02:53.710> how<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.040> was<00:02:54.690> then<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.710> do<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.010> her

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
like how it was then you can do like her

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.870 
like how it was then you can do like her
instead<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:58.270> a<00:02:58.300> real<00:02:58.720> mermaid<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.610> like

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
instead like a real mermaid but I like

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.420 
instead like a real mermaid but I like
using<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.510> then<00:03:02.140> wouldn't<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.710> it<00:03:02.950> just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
using and then wouldn't you have it just

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.550 
using and then wouldn't you have it just
like
