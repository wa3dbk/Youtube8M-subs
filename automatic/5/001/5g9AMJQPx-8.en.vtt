00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.830
 books and I need to show you the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.099
 five biggest books on my shelf 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 that the garden and the two best books 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.079
 The moment I have not seen it yet 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.110
 well then we go with 954 pages on 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 the takeover of iphan king 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 This book is wonderful, I've had enough of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.379
 tell you how much I indicate he 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 neither appears during the reading nor seems 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.910
 which are more than 900 pages you have one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.840
 average book weight is quite heavy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 looks marking most of the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 books in this gui ranking are great 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 This book will turn into a tv series 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.080
 it is also well worth it you read if in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 second place with 816 pages 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.530
 I have the synchrony day pass. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.090
 This is the first book in a trilogy. 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 recently I read the 12 that is the second 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 book I prefer the passage was a book 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.799
 that I liked it a lot 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.600
 it happens in an apocalyptic future 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.390
 where they grew up quiet in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.189
 laboratory and the experiment did not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.079
 very sure of course 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 very very good I recommend this from here 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 reading has moments that take a while 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.670
 more to spend much more culture 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.729
 descriptive is west fucking ing a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 his narrative is very fluid he is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.869
 indescribable 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.689
 but the leaves our leaves pass thus 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.689
 that you do not even see now justin cronin has 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:06.159
 When you realize that the book 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:09.599
 good angel in third place with 750 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.209
 on four pages i have breaking dawn 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.900
 which is the fourth book in the series to just go there 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.330
 and stefhany 6 to 1 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.430
 I do not recommend this book, I do not 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.590
 I like people particularly, I do not 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 I liked this book I did not like the way 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 as the author finished the series 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.049
 I really liked it, I'll confess, I will not be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 hypocrite to say that I did not like 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.670
 I liked it, I liked it, that place died. 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.099
 clips are the books that I liked the most 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.709
 this new moon series I did not like very much 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:45.310
 nor of breaking dawn 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.950
 I expected much more at last I'm here. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.180
 To talk about the book, right? 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.769
 with 702 pages harry potter and the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.810
 Phoenix 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.519
 I really like this book. It's the second one. 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.750
 What do you like most about harry's books? 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.629
 potter 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 my edit unfortunately economic 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.019
 it was never read because I read the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.599
 borrow books from my brother and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.760
 my cousin mateus the books always left 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.250
 at christmas time 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.549
 And then they won the books, people. 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.280
 spend the holidays on the beach and then I 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.230
 borrow his books the fifth book 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.400
 It was the last book I borrowed from you. 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 sixth the sixth and seventh present environment 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.419
 so until the fifth book my question 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.299
 economic and patience, I do not want 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:39.609
 buy the edition a hardcover edition 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.010
 a hardcover collection I just do not care 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:46.660
 I still decided if I want the edition 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.650
 English or American bon in fifth place 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.109
 with 685 pages I have the queen of 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.680
 air castle that is the last book of the 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:00.730
 stieg larsson 's trilogy millennium 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.669
 I really like this technology the beginning 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.660
 she is a very tiresome man who does not 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.170
 men who did not love 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.740
 women over a hundred first 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.720
 pages is slow it does not seem to 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.780
 has a lot of information about 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.110
 place they are very character 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.390
 very name of the family then surnames 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.230
 very similar 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.020
 the new ones themselves are difficult, not 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.650
 common for people in Portuguese that kind 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.420
 name but the main character of the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.120
 city ​​sander it stands out it's me neither 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.660
 I know if it is considered it is considered 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.860
 together with michael nor the two 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.690
 divide two have equal importance 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.120
 inside the trilogy is fantastic people i 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.940
 I love this series and the queen of 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.030
 air castle is the best 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.800
 good now the two books bigger than me 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.520
 I have on my shelf I have not read the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.850
 first is the pillars of the earth that I 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.550
 I won the dawn with this edition and 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.600
 hardcover ken follet and he has us 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.750
 The 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.760
 Okay, I do not know when I'll read this 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.790
 I want to read a lot I like a lot 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.980
 of medieval stories but I have to 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.820
 is in the mood for this kind of story 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.040
 what is it is not any time like this 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.850
 I like to concentrate I usually have 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.650
 enough information so I really want 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:47.290
 read the pillars of the earth 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:49.810
 and then as we shall see 836 pages 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:55.870
 I have a game of thrones is the first 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:58.690
 book of martin george orwell series is 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.180
 My decision is because it's English. 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.320
 the letters are small the margins are 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.570
 small 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.680
 this is one of the major reasons still 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.520
 not having read the war of thrones 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.880
 was and besides what it is I have the climate to 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.039
 it is this kind of story is also good 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.080
 You do not talk to me anyway. 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.000
 Mariano this report he has more 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
 pages alright 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.560
 the Portuguese edition to 590 and 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.650
 two pages and if we compare 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.030
 edition in Portuguese then greater than 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:35.150
 it I have with 658 large pages 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.430
