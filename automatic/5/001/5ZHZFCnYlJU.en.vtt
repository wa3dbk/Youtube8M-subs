it's<00:00:57.950> in<00:00:58.100> theory<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.490> could<00:00:58.580> do<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.820> without

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
it's in theory you could do it without

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.070 
it's in theory you could do it without
burning<00:01:00.140> your<00:01:00.320> hands<00:01:00.650> in<00:01:01.010> theory<00:01:01.310> now<00:01:02.090> cyclic

rate<00:01:03.260> how<00:01:03.470> fast<00:01:03.770> is<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.070> fire<00:01:04.400> sure<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:05.390> it's

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
rate how fast is it fire sure so it's

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:42.510 
rate how fast is it fire sure so it's
super<00:01:06.050> soon<00:01:15.790> Wow

gun<00:01:45.740> I'd<00:01:45.920> heard<00:01:46.100> good<00:01:46.130> things<00:01:46.340> about<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.880> from

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
gun I'd heard good things about it from

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.310 
gun I'd heard good things about it from
some<00:01:47.330> people<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> states<00:01:47.990> who've<00:01:48.170> had

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
some people in the states who've had

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.630 
some people in the states who've had
some<00:01:48.560> trigger<00:01:48.770> time<00:01:49.040> with<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.400> very

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
some trigger time with it very

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.820 
some trigger time with it very
controllable<00:01:50.420> especially<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.410> that<00:01:51.560> mount

which<00:01:52.160> had<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.640> recoil<00:01:53.180> dampener<00:01:53.720> in<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.900> stock

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
which had a recoil dampener in the stock

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.170 
which had a recoil dampener in the stock
and<00:01:54.440> dude<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.860> was<00:01:54.979> impressive<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.729> could<00:01:56.000> see

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
and dude that was impressive I could see

and dude that was impressive I could see
with<00:01:56.300> an<00:01:56.450> optic<00:01:56.840> especially<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.770> could<00:01:57.920> do

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
with an optic especially you could do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.070 
with an optic especially you could do
some<00:01:58.190> serious<00:01:58.340> work<00:01:58.670> with<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:58.970> guy<00:01:59.150> what<00:02:00.050> I

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
some serious work with that guy what I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.480 
some serious work with that guy what I
thought<00:02:00.350> was<00:02:00.530> interesting<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.220> feeds

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
thought was interesting it then feeds

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.010 
thought was interesting it then feeds
from<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.760> right<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.210> ejects<00:02:02.570> from<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.780> right
