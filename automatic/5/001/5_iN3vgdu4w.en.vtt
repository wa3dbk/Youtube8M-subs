00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.170
 of this here is the very multi-functional 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.840
 the quarter that should appear 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.720
 as a molecule downtown these two 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.200
 buildings are like two pearls and like these two 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.800
 gems around them like 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.830
 there is a movement along the promenade in 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.949
 side of the river 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.309
 that is, the side building elements they 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.100
 form edges form 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.680
 scope of the whole ensemble movement of people 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.129
 happens in the middle of this 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.600
 except for the boulevard and two central 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.159
 buildings by their form they are 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.930
 quite unique in St. Petersburg on 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.760
 each time we choose the approach that is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170
 our view 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.680
 either on the principle of contrast or in 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.350
 principle of continuation 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.420
 meets those original conditions 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.970
 which we find in place you must 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.970
 naturally listen conditionally listen 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.740
 city from here hear that place to me 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.969
 propose something to design and 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 build and measure your understanding 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.619
 development of the city for your understanding 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.729
 building each particular place we 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.619
 accordingly, we offer some ideas 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.329
 specific images and specific tasks but 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.210
 they are born in the most spontaneous way 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:42.469
 it certainly is in architecture as 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.940
 everywhere the concept of fashion is and go say 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.820
 today's mainstream again 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.520
 I do not want to repeat that is, we first 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.310
 we do the general concept of us yet 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.920
 we develop options then we find 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 one option which seems 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 we are the best here and then either 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.930
 we divide objects which are included in the concept 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.000
 between each other and everyone does their own 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.700
 here are some works if u 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 me or eugenia have any 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 considerations or any concerns on 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.190
 about a particular decision that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.710
 taken there and open loose about 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.670
 We say this but still for us 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.200
 shoulders now more than ten years 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.660
 cooperation is a purely modern 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.880
 so far there is no 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.570
 historical analogies 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 and people because modern style was 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.110
 actually already behind the project a new city 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.930
 his 1 fewer queues here is the bank 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.989
 St. Petersburg, too, all general of course 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 modern building therefore between 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.320
 project bank bank st. petersburg and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.020
 new city doing something else was 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.580
 would be strange therefore the very beginning 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.820
 focused on 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.230
 minaev if it is already a residential building with one 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.890
 hand he must be modern 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.920
 the other side it seems that a residential house 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:20.020
 should be so well conditionally warm here 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.650
 he should be attractive should not 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.830
 be like some kind of clinic in this 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.680
 or to the office so we wanted to do 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.920
 him in the first place on such a fine-meshed in 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 second how warm on material 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.560
 again to do something which was not yet 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.540
 I think architecture is really 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.470
 must be so emotional and 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.100
 sensual and to cling to the eye 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.500
 constantly details of the house but the trouble 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.670
 modern architecture is in many ways 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.200
 tour schedule one idea and more 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.810
 look at the building for example ursa from 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 lord once looked at you 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.620
 it is no longer interesting because the total 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.880
 the idea is clear 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.760
 No details no no sensuality no 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.980
 tactile sensation no no visual 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.350
 the interests of the return of this quality 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.890
 we see one of our tasks as 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.780
 we want to realize a new year in the project 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.990
 seems very important to us 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.169
 application of interesting new materials 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.860
 this is not ceramics in the first place 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.750
 high-quality ceramics which 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.750
 applied for example on an oval building 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.919
 such materials are still in Petersburg 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.039
 not used although it is a pity the materials 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.840
 very resistant high strength 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.000
 able to withstand both our weather and ours 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.180
 precipitation and what a sin to conceal and 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.979
 aging 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.590
 any material at all 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.770
 Naturally for buildings this material 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.220
 endures all these factors 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:09.840
 very well aging decently like on 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:13.680
 We speak not decrepit and his form 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.840
 surface glossiness 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.380
 contribute let's say so his spiritual 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.770
 longevity in Russia end unfortunately 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.449
 still very expensive construction 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.310
 process 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.720
 a large amount of materials 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.039
 construction is imported mainly 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.130
 these are finishing materials 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.740
 own construction base is not large 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.750
 if you imagine that another hundred years 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.050
 back Russia let out fine 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.729
 facing brick 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.949
 beautiful own stone too 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.669
 Kazan Cathedral was built only from 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:53.260
 stones you to design near and far 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:56.199
 Petersburg neighborhood now we 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.659
 we can hardly imagine that the object 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.599
 can be entirely created from materials 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.490
 which are produced in Russia is on 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.229
 today's big problem but not 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.360
 less than the building needs to be done qualitatively 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.490
 means you need to bring materials chose 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.230
 I would imagine a complex new apartment 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.810
 city â€‹â€‹other things being equal yes if 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.500
 I wondered about someone from modern 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.560
 complexes 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.550
 buy yourself an apartment probably yes because 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.680
 what is this good place this is good 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.950
 modern design is good 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.950
 infrastructure
