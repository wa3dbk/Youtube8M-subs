00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
color theory well my idea is that we all

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.050 
color theory well my idea is that we all
possess<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:25.199> certain<00:00:25.529> set<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.949> colors<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.880> us

possess a certain set of colors in us

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.599 
possess a certain set of colors in us
and<00:00:27.689> they're<00:00:27.869> dictated<00:00:28.289> by<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.010> colors<00:00:29.340> found

in<00:00:29.760> our<00:00:29.910> hair<00:00:30.240> eyes<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.929> skin<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:32.009> idea<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
in our hair eyes and skin and my idea is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that when you wear your true colors as I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
that when you wear your true colors as I
call<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.420> illuminate
