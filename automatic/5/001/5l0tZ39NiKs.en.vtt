um<00:03:42.700> some<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.820> asked<00:03:43.970> me<00:03:44.090> if<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.269> gonna<00:03:44.390> cut<00:03:44.690> my

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
um some I asked me if I'm gonna cut my

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.600 
um some I asked me if I'm gonna cut my
curly<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:45.709> we<00:03:45.860> start<00:03:46.100> with<00:03:46.190> two<00:03:46.340> strand

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
curly because we start with two strand

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.990 
curly because we start with two strand
twists<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.660> know<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.579> have<00:03:49.610> like

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
twists you know it's like you have like

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.140 
twists you know it's like you have like
two<00:03:50.470> two<00:03:51.470> different<00:03:51.890> looking<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.790> know<00:03:52.820> it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
two two different looking you know it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.030 
two two different looking you know it
doesn't<00:03:53.299> really<00:03:53.510> look<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.320> uniform<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
doesn't really look that uniform to

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.160 
doesn't really look that uniform to
begin<00:03:55.310> with<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:55.760> none<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.630> them<00:03:56.870> cut<00:03:57.079> them

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
begin with so none of them cut them

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.660 
begin with so none of them cut them
because<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.500> feel<00:03:57.530> like<00:03:57.950> they'll<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.640> know

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
because I feel like they'll you know

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.949 
because I feel like they'll you know
they'll<00:03:59.060> eventually<00:03:59.920> start<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.900> look<00:04:02.900> like

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
they'll eventually start to look like

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.110 
they'll eventually start to look like
the<00:04:03.290> other<00:04:03.470> part<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.250> I'm<00:04:04.400> fine<00:04:04.640> with<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.940> like

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the other part so I'm fine with it like

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.870 
the other part so I'm fine with it like
they<00:04:05.269> don't<00:04:05.450> bother<00:04:05.570> me<00:04:05.780> at<00:04:05.870> all<00:04:06.049> I<00:04:06.769> got<00:04:07.760> some

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
they don't bother me at all I got some

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.069 
they don't bother me at all I got some
questions<00:04:08.000> about<00:04:08.239> interlocking<00:04:09.019> an

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
questions about interlocking an

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.780 
questions about interlocking an
interlocking<00:04:09.470> seems<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.220> be<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> little<00:04:10.579> bit

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
interlocking seems to be a little bit

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.819 
interlocking seems to be a little bit
too<00:04:10.940> much<00:04:11.150> for<00:04:11.329> me<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.720> am<00:04:12.260> on<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.440> way<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.620> your

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
too much for me I am on the way to your

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.360 
too much for me I am on the way to your
size<00:04:13.070> though<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.410> don't<00:04:15.950> know<00:04:16.100> I'm

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
size though I just I don't know I'm

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.020 
size though I just I don't know I'm
gonna<00:04:16.549> might<00:04:16.850> like<00:04:17.030> put<00:04:17.479> knots<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:17.959> my<00:04:17.989> hair<00:04:18.380> or

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
gonna might like put knots in my hair or

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.140 
gonna might like put knots in my hair or
mess<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> up<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.660> then<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.910> seems<00:04:23.090> like

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
mess it up and then it just seems like

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.629 
mess it up and then it just seems like
so<00:04:23.360> much<00:04:23.479> work<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:24.289> will<00:04:24.530> probably<00:04:25.330> never

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
so much work so I will probably never

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.839 
so much work so I will probably never
that<00:04:26.909> had<00:04:27.120> never<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.719> a<00:04:27.780> lot<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.550> just<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.759> just

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
that had never in a lot I just I just

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.100 
that had never in a lot I just I just
don't<00:04:30.300> feel<00:04:30.449> like<00:04:30.509> it

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
don't feel like it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.640 
don't feel like it
so<00:04:32.120> I've<00:04:33.120> never<00:04:33.300> Pomerol<00:04:33.780> my<00:04:33.930> hair<00:04:34.080> either<00:04:34.259> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
roots and then I hold the root down and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.420 
roots and then I hold the root down and
then<00:04:51.449> I<00:04:51.569> retwist<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.229> like<00:04:52.409> that<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.159> then<00:04:53.279> I
