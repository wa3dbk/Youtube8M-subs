paper once I've made the crease it will
be<00:01:22.380> easier<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:23.010> will<00:01:23.130> show<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.370> again

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:03.710 

you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.270 

who's<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.650> this<00:02:04.830> triangle<00:02:05.430> shape<00:02:07.280> fold

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
who's now at this triangle shape fold

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.810 
who's now at this triangle shape fold
the<00:02:08.460> top<00:02:08.729> layer<00:02:09.030> back<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:10.760> around<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
the top layer back like so around a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
the top layer back like so around a
couple<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> centimeters

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600 

you<00:02:31.260> should<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.560> these<00:02:31.740> two<00:02:32.040> points<00:02:32.280> es

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you should have these two points es

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.150 
you should have these two points es
sticking<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:34.350> flatten<00:02:34.950> them<00:02:39.920> next<00:02:40.920> from

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
sticking up so flatten them next from

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:52.960 
sticking up so flatten them next from
this<00:02:41.370> point<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:43.010> fold<00:02:44.010> each<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.550> these<00:02:44.670> flaps

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:05.350 

this<00:02:53.970> will<00:02:54.209> create<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> claws<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.440> crab

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.229 

you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:35.089 

next<00:03:09.239> pre-crease<00:03:09.930> these<00:03:10.409> flops<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.280> so

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:42.559 

or<00:03:35.640> fold<00:03:35.939> them

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.860 

I<00:03:42.659> felt<00:03:43.379> this<00:03:43.590> point<00:03:43.980> here<00:03:44.219> to<00:03:44.969> the<00:03:45.090> flaps<00:03:45.390> we

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
I felt this point here to the flaps we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.570 
I felt this point here to the flaps we
flattened<00:03:46.409> earlier

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.120 

next<00:03:54.330> with<00:03:54.540> these<00:03:54.720> points<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.500> precreased

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
next with these points we precreased

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.340 
next with these points we precreased
earlier<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:57.150> should<00:03:57.210> be<00:03:57.420> easy<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.840> fold<00:03:58.170> them

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
earlier it should be easy to fold them

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.000 
earlier it should be easy to fold them
down<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.830> create<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.460> back<00:03:59.670> legs
