00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.900 

up<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> ether

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:03:00.680 

up<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.209> ear

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690

there you have it in the key of b-flat
silent<00:03:04.570> night<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.440> reason<00:03:06.070> for<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.760> key

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
silent night now the reason for that key

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.970 
silent night now the reason for that key
is<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:07.660> more<00:03:08.050> singable<00:03:08.500> because<00:03:08.860> your

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
is it's just more singable because your

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.730 
is it's just more singable because your
top<00:03:09.250> note<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.730> an<00:03:10.360> E<00:03:10.660> flat<00:03:10.930> right<00:03:11.320> there<00:03:11.560> your

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
top note is an E flat right there your

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.860 
top note is an E flat right there your
top<00:03:11.950> knows<00:03:12.130> an<00:03:12.310> E<00:03:12.430> flat<00:03:12.580> if<00:03:13.180> you're<00:03:13.420> singing<00:03:13.750> in

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
top knows an E flat if you're singing in

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.410 
top knows an E flat if you're singing in
the<00:03:13.959> key<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.890> key<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.190> C<00:03:15.700> your<00:03:16.000> top<00:03:16.180> note<00:03:16.390> is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the key of the key of C your top note is

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.240 
the key of the key of C your top note is
an<00:03:16.600> F<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.050> it's<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.410> bit<00:03:17.590> lower<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.920> sing

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
an F so it's a little bit lower to sing

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.820 
an F so it's a little bit lower to sing
it's<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.520> little<00:03:18.760> bit<00:03:18.850> more<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.270> range<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
it's a little bit more in the range and
