00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
five dollar fifty dollar I think that's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
five dollar fifty dollar I think that's
the<00:01:27.330> most<00:01:27.450> fair<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.500> 60

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

the most fair we would do like 60
ten-dollar<00:01:29.310> winners<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.750> think

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
ten-dollar winners but I don't think

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
ten-dollar winners but I don't think
that's<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:32.070> something<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> get

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that's like really something to get

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.010 
that's like really something to get
excited<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.509> we'll<00:01:33.659> probably<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
excited about so we'll probably have a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
excited about so we'll probably have a
couple<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:35.070> 11<00:01:35.700> hundred<00:01:35.820> dollar<00:01:36.119> one

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
couple like maybe 11 hundred dollar one
