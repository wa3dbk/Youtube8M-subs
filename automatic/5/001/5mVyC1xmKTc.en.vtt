00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.920 

so<00:00:09.050> because<00:00:09.710> the<00:00:10.130> there<00:00:10.580> are<00:00:10.820> superficial<00:00:11.809> and

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
so because the there are superficial and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.310 
so because the there are superficial and
deep<00:00:12.110> muscles<00:00:13.000> I'm<00:00:14.000> going<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:14.570> need<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.020> bisect

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
deep muscles I'm going to need to bisect

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.220 
deep muscles I'm going to need to bisect
these<00:00:15.740> muscles<00:00:16.189> to<00:00:16.400> reveal<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:17.600> deep<00:00:17.840> muscles

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
these muscles to reveal the deep muscles

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.230 
these muscles to reveal the deep muscles
underneath<00:00:18.529> them<00:00:18.860> so<00:00:19.460> I'm<00:00:19.550> actually<00:00:19.730> going<00:00:20.119> to

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
underneath them so I'm actually going to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.460 
underneath them so I'm actually going to
switch<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.910> other<00:00:23.090> side<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:24.050> do<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.320> deep

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
switch to the other side to do the deep

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.530 
switch to the other side to do the deep
muscle<00:00:24.860> so<00:00:24.980> I'm<00:00:25.040> going<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.250> leave<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.210> side

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
muscle so I'm going to leave this side

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.589 
muscle so I'm going to leave this side
as<00:00:26.840> my<00:00:27.169> superficial<00:00:27.800> side<00:00:28.270> alright<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.570> I

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
as my superficial side alright so that I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.990 
as my superficial side alright so that I
can<00:00:29.810> clearly<00:00:30.110> see<00:00:30.259> my<00:00:30.800> Sartorius<00:00:31.759> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
can clearly see my Sartorius and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.620 
can clearly see my Sartorius and
gracilis<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:33.739> I'm<00:00:34.489> going<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.730> do<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.300> exact

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
gracilis and I'm going to do the exact

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.299 
gracilis and I'm going to do the exact
same<00:00:35.660> thing<00:00:36.790> that<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:37.850> did<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:39.680> left<00:00:40.039> side

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
same thing that I did to the left side

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.669 
same thing that I did to the left side
to<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:41.629> right<00:00:41.870> side<00:00:43.000> what<00:00:44.000> I<00:00:44.030> want<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.390> do

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
to the right side what I want to do

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.709 
to the right side what I want to do
again<00:00:45.679> just<00:00:46.219> kind<00:00:46.429> of<00:00:46.519> workout<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.269> clear<00:00:47.600> out

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
again just kind of workout to clear out

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.959 
again just kind of workout to clear out
that<00:00:47.899> underneath<00:00:48.170> connective<00:00:48.710> tissue<00:00:48.940> when<00:00:49.940> I

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
that underneath connective tissue when I

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.829 
that underneath connective tissue when I
get<00:00:50.179> the<00:00:50.300> probe<00:00:50.629> right<00:00:51.469> at<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.690> kind<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
get the probe right at the kind of the

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.419 
get the probe right at the kind of the
midway<00:00:54.379> point<00:00:54.820> take<00:00:55.820> my<00:00:56.000> scissors<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:58.280> could

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
midway point take my scissors you could

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.160 
midway point take my scissors you could
also<00:00:58.579> do<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:58.999> a<00:00:59.059> scalpel<00:00:59.480> I<00:00:59.539> just<00:00:59.809> find<00:01:00.019> it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
also do it with a scalpel I just find it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.710 
also do it with a scalpel I just find it
to<00:01:00.379> be<00:01:00.499> easier<00:01:01.039> with<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.550> scissors<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:04.720> a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
to be easier with the scissors and a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.850 
to be easier with the scissors and a
little<00:01:06.290> safer<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.270> cut<00:01:08.860> that

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
little safer and then just cut that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.940 
little safer and then just cut that
muscle<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.430> half<00:01:11.020> alright<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:12.410> then<00:01:12.590> we

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
muscle in half alright so then we

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.200 
muscle in half alright so then we
reflect<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:15.170> muscle<00:01:15.530> back<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.220> now<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.880> can

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
reflect the muscle back and now I can

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.960 
reflect the muscle back and now I can
reveal<00:01:17.390> these<00:01:17.720> deep<00:01:17.990> muscles<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.970> so

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
reveal these deep muscles and so

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.530 
reveal these deep muscles and so
underneath<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:22.900> Sartorius<00:01:24.850> are<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.150> muscles

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
underneath the Sartorius are the muscles

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540 
underneath the Sartorius are the muscles
that<00:01:26.630> make<00:01:26.840> up<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.290> quadriceps<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.220> there<00:01:28.430> are

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
that make up the quadriceps so there are

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.260 
that make up the quadriceps so there are
four<00:01:28.880> muscles<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.070> they<00:01:31.070> are<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.530> vastus

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
four muscles and they are the vastus

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.800 
four muscles and they are the vastus
medialis<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.230> rectus<00:01:37.030> femoris<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:39.340> vastus

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
medialis the rectus femoris the vastus

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.990 
medialis the rectus femoris the vastus
lateralis<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:42.800> between<00:01:43.040> here<00:01:43.730> is<00:01:43.880> going

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
lateralis and in between here is going

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.750 
lateralis and in between here is going
to<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.390> vastus<00:01:44.870> intermedius<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:46.100> that's

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
to be the vastus intermedius and that's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.540 
to be the vastus intermedius and that's
a<00:01:47.000> much<00:01:47.300> deeper<00:01:47.720> muscle<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.920> we'll<00:01:49.130> need<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
a much deeper muscle that we'll need to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.480 
a much deeper muscle that we'll need to
kind<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.910> separate<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:51.500> rectus<00:01:51.650> femoris<00:01:52.160> and

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
kind of separate the rectus femoris and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
kind of separate the rectus femoris and
rectus<00:01:53.500> embassadors<00:01:54.500> lateralis<00:01:55.190> in<00:01:55.400> order<00:01:56.150> to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
rectus embassadors lateralis in order to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.020 
rectus embassadors lateralis in order to
see<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.650> I'm<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.920> do<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.850> just

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
see so what I'm going to do now is just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.190 
see so what I'm going to do now is just
try<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.840> separate<00:02:00.560> these<00:02:00.950> three<00:02:01.490> muscles<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
try to separate these three muscles and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.270 
try to separate these three muscles and
so<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:07.479> connective<00:02:08.479> tissue

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.780 

that<00:02:12.280> again<00:02:12.610> would<00:02:13.180> need<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:13.659> removed<00:02:17.790> all

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that again would need to be removed all

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.910 
that again would need to be removed all
right<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.450> I'll<00:02:21.390> remove<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.890> later<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.709> if

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
right and I'll remove that later but if

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.809 
right and I'll remove that later but if
you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:28.420> see<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:31.150> muscle<00:02:31.989> here<00:02:32.819> it's

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
you can see there is a muscle here it's

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.699 
you can see there is a muscle here it's
a<00:02:33.939> very<00:02:34.209> very<00:02:34.510> thin<00:02:34.959> muscle<00:02:37.409> with<00:02:38.409> that

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
a very very thin muscle with that

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.809 
a very very thin muscle with that
connective<00:02:39.370> tissue<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
connective tissue all right so the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.740 
connective tissue all right so the
boundary<00:02:43.329> of<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.629> muscle<00:02:44.049> is<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:48.750> all

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
boundary of the muscle is there all

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
boundary of the muscle is there all
right<00:02:49.930> that's<00:02:50.319> not<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> muscle<00:02:50.859> that<00:02:51.159> we<00:02:51.400> need

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.210 

so<00:02:55.750> we're<00:02:55.989> going<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.200> ignore<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so we're going to ignore that and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.580 
so we're going to ignore that and
actually<00:02:57.639> cut<00:02:58.389> this<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> more<00:02:59.109> dense

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
actually cut this is a more dense

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.789 
actually cut this is a more dense
connective<00:03:00.010> tissue<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.019> for<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.439> it

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
connective tissue and so for this it

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.640 
connective tissue and so for this it
might<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.400> easier<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.239> use<00:03:05.139> this

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
might be a little easier to use this

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:19.460 
might be a little easier to use this
scalpel<00:03:09.389> just<00:03:10.389> to<00:03:10.510> cut<00:03:10.780> through

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.500 

so<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.800> can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:23.230> vastus<00:03:27.510> lateralis

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
so that we can see the vastus lateralis

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.850 
so that we can see the vastus lateralis
as<00:03:29.140> well<00:03:29.470> as<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:31.020> rectus<00:03:32.020> for<00:03:32.530> Morris<00:03:37.860> all

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
as well as the rectus for Morris all

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.740 
as well as the rectus for Morris all
right<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.280> I'm<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.400> gonna<00:03:39.760> reflect<00:03:40.570> this

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
right so I'm just gonna reflect this

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.730 
right so I'm just gonna reflect this
back<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> bit<00:03:41.500> more<00:03:41.830> all<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:43.270> so<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.740> you

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
back a bit more all right and so now you

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.250 
back a bit more all right and so now you
can<00:03:44.890> really<00:03:45.130> see<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.730> actually<00:03:46.630> closer<00:03:47.020> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
can really see and actually closer to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.930 
can really see and actually closer to
the<00:03:47.380> origin<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.130> muscle<00:03:48.580> where<00:03:48.760> this

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the origin of this muscle where this

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.479 
the origin of this muscle where this
adipose<00:03:49.480> tissue<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.739> can<00:03:50.890> see<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
adipose tissue is you can see the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.930 
adipose tissue is you can see the
division<00:03:52.060> between<00:03:52.300> these<00:03:52.870> three<00:03:53.290> muscles<00:03:53.940> so

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
division between these three muscles so

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.170 
division between these three muscles so
this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.540> vastus<00:03:56.080> lateralis<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
this is the vastus lateralis this is the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.960 
this is the vastus lateralis this is the
rectus<00:03:58.690> from<00:03:58.930> Morris<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.709> this<00:04:00.580> is<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
rectus from Morris and this is the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.759 
rectus from Morris and this is the
vastus<00:04:01.450> medialis<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:03.480> one<00:04:04.480> two<00:04:04.900> three<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
vastus medialis so one two three and

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.870 
vastus medialis so one two three and
then<00:04:06.580> in<00:04:06.880> between<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:08.340> these<00:04:09.340> two<00:04:09.640> muscles

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
then in between here these two muscles

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:18.420 
then in between here these two muscles
is<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:13.530> vastus<00:04:14.530> intermedius<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
is the vastus intermedius and so the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.690 
is the vastus intermedius and so the
separation<00:04:19.359> between<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:23.370> vastus<00:04:24.370> lateralis

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
separation between the vastus lateralis

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.110 
separation between the vastus lateralis
and<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.479> rectus<00:04:25.979> for<00:04:26.979> Morris<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:30.120> really

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
and the rectus for Morris is really

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.050 
and the rectus for Morris is really
tricky<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.890> that's<00:04:35.890> why<00:04:36.130> I'm<00:04:36.250> using<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.790> pro

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
tricky so that's why I'm using the pro

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.900 
tricky so that's why I'm using the pro
because<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.570> really<00:04:37.960> easy<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.700> tear<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
because it's really easy to tear the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.460 
because it's really easy to tear the
muscle<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.520> really<00:04:43.150> want<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:44.140> you

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
muscle and so you really want to and you

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.010 
muscle and so you really want to and you
might<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.190> get<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:46.210> look<00:04:46.570> really

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
might have to get just look really

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.909 
might have to get just look really
closely<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:49.050> where<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.260> is<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
closely to see where it is that the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.390 
closely to see where it is that the
muscle<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:52.380> separates<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:54.130> don't<00:04:54.280> want

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
muscle actually separates you don't want

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.460 
muscle actually separates you don't want
to<00:04:54.490> create<00:04:54.790> new<00:04:55.060> muscles<00:04:55.510> they<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.290> kind<00:04:56.440> of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
to create new muscles they just kind of

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.440 
to create new muscles they just kind of
want<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.650> leave<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.979> muscles<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.430> are<00:04:57.490> that

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
want to leave the muscles that are that

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:09.269 
want to leave the muscles that are that
are<00:04:58.570> there<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:01.080> place<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.539> looks<00:05:04.810> like

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:23.100 

I've<00:05:10.279> found<00:05:10.789> the<00:05:11.259> separation<00:05:17.439> and<00:05:18.439> so<00:05:18.849> we<00:05:19.849> can

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.709 

see<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:28.300> but<00:05:29.300> there's<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.139> separation

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
see it but there's the separation

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.709 
see it but there's the separation
between<00:05:32.719> the<00:05:33.050> vastus<00:05:33.620> lateralis<00:05:34.719> rectus

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
between the vastus lateralis rectus

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.850 
between the vastus lateralis rectus
femoris<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.559> then<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:38.539> vastus<00:05:39.169> medialis

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
femoris and then the vastus medialis

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.519 
femoris and then the vastus medialis
here<00:05:42.759> now<00:05:43.759> what<00:05:44.060> I'm<00:05:44.150> going<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.360> do<00:05:44.629> is<00:05:44.990> just

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
here now what I'm going to do is just

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.159 
here now what I'm going to do is just
continue<00:05:46.189> working<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:47.240> separate<00:05:47.749> these<00:05:47.960> two

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
continue working to separate these two

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.890 
continue working to separate these two
muscles<00:05:48.409> so<00:05:49.370> as<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.759> reveal<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.419> vastus

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
muscles so as to reveal the vastus

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.010 
muscles so as to reveal the vastus
intermedius<00:05:51.490> so<00:05:52.490> if<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.449> look<00:05:53.719> I've<00:05:53.900> been

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
intermedius so if you look I've been

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.860 
intermedius so if you look I've been
able<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.289> separate<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.339> rectus<00:05:55.729> femoris<00:05:56.419> and

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
able to separate the rectus femoris and

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.149 
able to separate the rectus femoris and
the<00:05:57.080> vastus<00:05:57.589> lateralis<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:59.270> see<00:05:59.569> a<00:05:59.810> muscle

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
the vastus lateralis to see a muscle

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.290 
the vastus lateralis to see a muscle
deep<00:06:01.159> down<00:06:01.729> there<00:06:02.259> that<00:06:03.259> lies<00:06:03.849> really<00:06:04.849> close

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
deep down there that lies really close

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.320 
deep down there that lies really close
to<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:05.689> femur<00:06:06.469> and<00:06:06.889> that's<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.729> vastus

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
to the femur and that's the vastus

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.769 
to the femur and that's the vastus
intermedius<00:06:09.399> so<00:06:10.399> it's<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:10.580> very<00:06:10.909> very<00:06:11.240> deep

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:11.779 
intermedius so it's a very very deep

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:17.290 
intermedius so it's a very very deep
bone<00:06:12.199> for<00:06:12.830> deep<00:06:13.159> muscle<00:06:13.789> that<00:06:15.699> runs<00:06:16.699> very<00:06:16.999> very

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
bone for deep muscle that runs very very

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.119 
bone for deep muscle that runs very very
close<00:06:17.749> to<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.710> femur

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
close to the femur

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.159 
close to the femur
all<00:06:19.669> right<00:06:20.499> so<00:06:21.499> those<00:06:21.680> are<00:06:21.889> the<00:06:22.039> quadriceps<00:06:22.819> as

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
all right so those are the quadriceps as

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.339 
all right so those are the quadriceps as
we<00:06:24.169> commonly<00:06:24.680> call<00:06:24.830> them
