hearing so this is my stethoscope I
really<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> quite<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> bit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
really like this I use this quite a bit

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.730 
really like this I use this quite a bit
I<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> pink<00:01:24.420> tape<00:01:24.689> over<00:01:25.530> here

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I actually put this pink tape over here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
I actually put this pink tape over here
because<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.430> name<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
because I have my name on it so this is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
because I have my name on it so this is
how<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.950> usually<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> put<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
how it is and usually when you put on a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.069 
how it is and usually when you put on a
thousand<00:01:30.659> scope<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.840> want

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
thousand scope you want them you want

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
thousand scope you want them you want
the<00:01:34.259> pointy<00:01:34.710> part<00:01:34.740> pointing<00:01:35.579> inwards<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the pointy part pointing inwards not the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.569 
the pointy part pointing inwards not the
other<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.500> around<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.340> won't

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
other way around because it just won't

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.780 
other way around because it just won't
fit<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.259> goes

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.660 

so<00:01:46.750> right<00:01:46.930> now<00:01:47.080> it's<00:01:47.290> on<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.830> tap<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.280> at<00:01:48.370> it<00:01:48.520> off

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
so right now it's on I tap it at it off

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.670 
so right now it's on I tap it at it off
it's<00:01:48.910> on<00:01:49.120> I'm<00:01:49.480> gonna<00:01:49.720> close<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.050> when<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.350> close

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
it's on I'm gonna close it when I close

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's on I'm gonna close it when I close
it<00:01:50.830> you're<00:01:50.980> gonna<00:01:51.070> see<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.640> hole<00:01:52.510> there

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
it you're gonna see that hole there

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.150 
it you're gonna see that hole there
