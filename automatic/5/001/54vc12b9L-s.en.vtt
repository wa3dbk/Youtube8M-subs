 short announcement for you and indeed

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 We are now in the month of fasting 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.869

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 typical dishes times 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.210
 I will be your typical turkish 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
 dishes also show much of the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.769
 Ottoman cuisine I think I have that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 about two months ago 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.070
 announced and have already been like that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 a list put in instagram 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.020
 about two months with dishes I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.059
 Maybe I'll cook everything 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 it could not be about three 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 videos come the week and as I said 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.250
 it is mainly Turkish only 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 are courts and you had it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.280
 even so all the time wanted 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 more lethal things so show of 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 main courses until dessert 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 I only show deadly things with the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.070
 I limit myself to myself as I do 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 namely after lent-time something like 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.380
 start a grill series and there I will 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 you already show so much what 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 You could eat something to side dishes 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 BBQ fits and so on 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 I'll double everything then 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 mated and that's why only comes now 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 these main courses of turkey and 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.070
 desserts it is actually better too 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.900
 Lent a bit in the evening 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 easy to eat health technology 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 because you do not drink anything the whole day 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.650
 you are nothing and that all day long 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 is actually better in the evening something 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.720
 to eat light healthy 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.729
