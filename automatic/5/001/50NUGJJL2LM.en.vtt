analyzing his W know that's what you got
to<00:01:24.680> do<00:01:24.799> I<00:01:24.830> think<00:01:25.130> that's<00:01:25.370> what<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.580> all<00:01:25.790> have<00:01:26.299> to

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
to do I think that's what we all have to

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.560 
to do I think that's what we all have to
do<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.909> trying<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:28.970> get<00:01:29.060> better<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.450> he

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
do it's trying to get better and he

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.840 
do it's trying to get better and he
definitely<00:01:29.840> does<00:01:30.080> so<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.159> difficult<00:01:31.520> to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
definitely does so is it difficult to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.000 
definitely does so is it difficult to
maintain<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:32.840> hunger<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.680> aside

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
maintain that that hunger that aside

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.080 
maintain that that hunger that aside
