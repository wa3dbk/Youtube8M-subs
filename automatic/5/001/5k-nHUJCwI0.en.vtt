upside down and this is the log on

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.639 
upside down and this is the log on
screen<00:01:37.399> apparently<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:39.170> kind<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.439> looks<00:01:39.590> like

screen apparently it kind of looks like
a<00:01:39.799> dock<00:01:40.159> like<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.789> Mac<00:01:40.939> OS<00:01:40.969> 10<00:01:41.210> dock<00:01:41.569> where<00:01:41.840> you

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
a dock like a Mac OS 10 dock where you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.679 
a dock like a Mac OS 10 dock where you
select<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.619> user<00:01:42.889> and<00:01:43.249> then<00:01:44.090> when<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.359> click

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
select the user and then when you click

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.109 
select the user and then when you click
on<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.979> like<00:01:46.130> jumps<00:01:46.429> out<00:01:46.549> of<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.729> dock<00:01:46.850> and

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
on it it like jumps out of the dock and

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.730 
on it it like jumps out of the dock and
loads<00:01:47.420> probably<00:01:48.020> tells<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.380> some<00:01:48.560> other

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
loads probably tells you some other

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.289 
loads probably tells you some other
things<00:01:49.039> like<00:01:49.280> how<00:01:49.429> many<00:01:49.490> unread<00:01:49.729> messages

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
things like how many unread messages

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.459

they<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.569> of<00:01:50.689> stuff<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:50.990> then<00:01:51.109> you<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.289> log

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469

introduced<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.110> way<00:02:18.230> organize<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.010> better<00:02:19.100> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
introduced the way organize it better so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.930 
introduced the way organize it better so
this<00:02:21.170> might<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.560> fixed<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.160> should<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.580> fixed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
this might be fixed it should be fixed

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.700 
this might be fixed it should be fixed
is<00:02:23.030> right<00:02:23.210> now<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.540> not<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.530> doesn't

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
is right now it's not really it doesn't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.520 
is right now it's not really it doesn't
really<00:02:24.860> look<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.310> decent<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> want

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
really look that decent but if you want

really look that decent but if you want
that<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.770> there<00:02:27.890> that's<00:02:28.010> fine<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.520> they're

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
that in there that's fine that I they're

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.370 
that in there that's fine that I they're
probably<00:02:29.540> gonna<00:02:29.780> include<00:02:30.320> new<00:02:30.920> UI<00:02:31.220> tweaks<00:02:31.400> and

probably gonna include new UI tweaks and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.810 
probably gonna include new UI tweaks and
this<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.500> kind<00:02:33.710> of<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.160> stacks<00:02:34.460> feature

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
this is kind of like the stacks feature

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.550 
this is kind of like the stacks feature
and<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> dock<00:02:35.270> only<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.750> works<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.050> icons<00:02:36.440> on

and the dock only it works with icons on

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.930 
and the dock only it works with icons on
the<00:02:36.650> desktop<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.490> like<00:02:37.640> click<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.880> a

the desktop so if you like click on a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.060 
the desktop so if you like click on a
folder<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.900> expands<00:02:39.380> them<00:02:39.590> out<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
folder it expands them out to like a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.190 
folder it expands them out to like a
grid<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.270> open<00:02:41.390> them<00:02:41.660> up<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:41.990> kind

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
grid so you can open them up it's kind

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.620 
grid so you can open them up it's kind
of<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> bump<00:02:42.740> top<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.640> 3d<00:02:43.940> operating

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
of like the bump top of the 3d operating

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.360 
of like the bump top of the 3d operating
system<00:02:44.990> sort<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.350> where<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> click<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
system sort of where you click on a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100 
system sort of where you click on a
folder<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.760> they<00:02:46.850> just<00:02:46.970> expand<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:48.020> you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
folder and they just expand on then you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.600 
folder and they just expand on then you
can<00:02:48.140> select<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.590> file<00:02:48.770> with<00:02:48.950> my<00:02:49.130> folder<00:02:49.490> and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
can select a file with my folder and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.220 
can select a file with my folder and
it's<00:02:50.060> kind<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.270> like<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> dock<00:02:50.690> only<00:02:51.080> they

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
it's kind of like the dock only they

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.960 
it's kind of like the dock only they
brought<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.890> desktop<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.550> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
brought it to the desktop and the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.080 
brought it to the desktop and the
windows<00:02:53.300> vewy<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> think<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
windows vewy so I think that that's a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.370 
windows vewy so I think that that's a
pretty<00:02:56.180> handy<00:02:56.480> feature<00:02:56.630> especially<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.260> has

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
pretty handy feature especially that has

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.060 
pretty handy feature especially that has
thumbnail<00:02:57.770> previews<00:02:59.110> even<00:03:00.110> though<00:03:00.290> Mac<00:03:00.800> OS<00:03:01.040> 10

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
thumbnail previews even though Mac OS 10

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.100 
thumbnail previews even though Mac OS 10
has<00:03:01.400> had<00:03:01.550> thumbnail<00:03:02.060> previews<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.870> sling

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
has had thumbnail previews and sling

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.640 
has had thumbnail previews and sling

but<00:03:05.189> moving<00:03:05.519> on

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.560 
but moving on
on<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.380> taskbar<00:03:07.740> apparently<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:08.610> much<00:03:09.300> more

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
on the taskbar apparently is much more

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.680 
on the taskbar apparently is much more
compact<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.230> has<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.820> arrow<00:03:11.820> peak<00:03:12.330> feature

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
compact it has the arrow peak feature

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.360 
compact it has the arrow peak feature
and<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:15.300> really<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.350> small<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:17.010> think<00:03:17.100> it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and it really is really small I think it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.520 
and it really is really small I think it
only<00:03:17.460> shows<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.210> running<00:03:18.630> applications

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
only shows you your running applications

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.770 
only shows you your running applications
you<00:03:20.130> hover<00:03:20.340> over<00:03:20.460> them<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.150> expand<00:03:21.600> out

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
you hover over them and they expand out

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.030 
you hover over them and they expand out
where<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.990> can<00:03:22.080> see<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.380> full<00:03:22.530> name<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:22.950> then

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
where you can see the full name and then

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.820 
where you can see the full name and then
see<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> arrow<00:03:23.580> peak<00:03:23.910> bar<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.560> you

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
see the arrow peak bar but I think you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.430 
see the arrow peak bar but I think you
can<00:03:26.010> pin<00:03:26.280> applications<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.240> taskbar<00:03:27.810> or

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
can pin applications of this taskbar or

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.010 
can pin applications of this taskbar or
I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.150> shows<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.720> running

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
I think it just shows you your running

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.320 
I think it just shows you your running
applications<00:03:31.650> I'm<00:03:31.770> not<00:03:31.950> exactly<00:03:32.190> sure<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
applications I'm not exactly sure but it

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.360 
applications I'm not exactly sure but it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
like this

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.610

the corners you couldn't like put it

anywhere on the side you can only put

those system tray and start meeting

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.100 
those system tray and start meeting
stuff<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> corners<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.510> Start<00:03:57.810> menu

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
stuff in the corners and this Start menu

stuff in the corners and this Start menu
of<00:03:58.230> course<00:03:58.500> looks<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.920> lot<00:03:59.250> more<00:03:59.580> simple<00:04:00.090> than

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
of course looks a lot more simple than

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.660 
of course looks a lot more simple than
the<00:04:00.540> other<00:04:00.690> ones<00:04:00.930> when<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.530> click<00:04:01.770> on<00:04:01.950> like

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
the other ones when you click on like

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.690 
the other ones when you click on like
some<00:04:03.360> programs<00:04:04.020> there<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.440> moves<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.490> and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
some programs there it just moves up and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.230 
some programs there it just moves up and
it<00:04:05.760> shows<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> list<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:08.850> that's

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
it shows you a list and I think that's

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.210 
it shows you a list and I think that's
okay<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> guess<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.350> still<00:04:10.530> has<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.860> searching

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
okay I guess it still has the searching

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.520 
okay I guess it still has the searching
function<00:04:11.640> which<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:12.000> useful<00:04:12.390> it's<00:04:13.170> just<00:04:13.380> when

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
function which is useful it's just when

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.740 
function which is useful it's just when
I<00:04:13.560> use<00:04:13.860> Windows<00:04:14.430> when<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.060> was<00:04:15.180> using<00:04:15.300> Windows<00:04:15.630> 7

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
I use Windows when I was using Windows 7

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.890 
I use Windows when I was using Windows 7
earlier<00:04:16.140> today<00:04:16.350> at<00:04:16.590> office<00:04:17.040> max<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.520> just

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
earlier today at office max I just

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.660 
earlier today at office max I just
wanted<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.020> load<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.290> control<00:04:19.680> panel<00:04:20.040> it

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
wanted to load the control panel it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.820 
wanted to load the control panel it
wasn't<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.180> Start<00:04:21.450> menu<00:04:21.780> wasn't<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.380 
wasn't in the Start menu wasn't in the

taskbar and you have to go search for
then<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.870> got<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.260> type<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.620> name<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.800> get

then you got to type in the name and get

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.130 
then you got to type in the name and get
it<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:27.060> hard<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:27.510> navigate<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.110> a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
it and it's hard to navigate on a

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.590 
it and it's hard to navigate on a
trackpad<00:04:28.530> through<00:04:29.100> tiny<00:04:29.760> buttons<00:04:30.360> in<00:04:30.510> the

trackpad through tiny buttons in the
Start<00:04:30.870> menu<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.680> looks<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:32.070> little<00:04:32.100> bit

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
Start menu this one looks a little bit

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.700 
Start menu this one looks a little bit
more<00:04:32.640> decent<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.840> will<00:04:33.900> most<00:04:34.110> likely<00:04:34.290> not

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
more decent but it will most likely not

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.590 
more decent but it will most likely not
be<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.160> final<00:04:35.580> one

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
be the final one

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.870 
be the final one
but<00:04:37.200> that's<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:37.980> what<00:04:38.250> Copenhagen

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
but that's just what Copenhagen

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.540 
but that's just what Copenhagen
currently<00:04:39.240> looks<00:04:39.420> like<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.130> those<00:04:41.310> are<00:04:41.460> my

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
currently looks like so those are my

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.130 
currently looks like so those are my
opinions<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:42.090> thoughts<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.420> Windows<00:04:42.690> 8<00:04:42.840> as<00:04:42.990> it

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
opinions and thoughts on Windows 8 as it

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.080 
opinions and thoughts on Windows 8 as it
is<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.410> far<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:43.860> probably<00:04:44.430> two<00:04:44.910> or<00:04:44.940> three

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
is so far it's probably two or three

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.490 
is so far it's probably two or three
years<00:04:45.210> from<00:04:45.600> being<00:04:45.780> released<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.290> if<00:04:46.380> they're

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
years from being released and if they're

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.860 
years from being released and if they're
doing<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.770> 128-bit<00:04:47.610> thing<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.970> have<00:04:48.360> no<00:04:48.600> idea

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
doing the 128-bit thing I have no idea

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.540 
doing the 128-bit thing I have no idea
but<00:04:48.990> like<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.230> said<00:04:49.410> earlier<00:04:49.680> at<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.890> time<00:04:50.160> of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
but like I said earlier at the time of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.470 
but like I said earlier at the time of
right<00:04:51.120> now<00:04:51.500> there<00:04:52.500> are<00:04:52.850> two<00:04:53.850> articles<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.450> our

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
right now there are two articles on our

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.230 
right now there are two articles on our
computing<00:04:55.230> clan<00:04:55.530> comm<00:04:56.070> website<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:57.120> would

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
computing clan comm website that would

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.880 
computing clan comm website that would
be<00:04:57.330> computing<00:04:57.750> cloud<00:04:57.870> comm<00:04:58.230> like<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.530> just<00:04:58.590> said

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
be computing cloud comm like I just said

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.860 
be computing cloud comm like I just said
it<00:04:58.980> obviously<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.610> we<00:05:00.270> talked<00:05:00.510> about<00:05:00.600> that

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
it obviously and we talked about that

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.540
