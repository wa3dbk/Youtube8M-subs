the truth is no one reads this thing and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
the truth is no one reads this thing and
that's<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.090> been<00:00:21.240> available<00:00:21.660> on

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that's because it's been available on

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500 
that's because it's been available on
the<00:00:22.199> internet<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:23.100> years<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:24.240> means

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the internet for years which means

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
the internet for years which means
taxpayers<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.590> been<00:00:25.740> funding<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.640> pretty
