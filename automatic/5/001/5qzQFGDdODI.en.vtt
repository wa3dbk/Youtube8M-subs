00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
tap it says for example in e 33 f 8 50

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.370 
tap it says for example in e 33 f 8 50
will<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.269> memorize<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.840> e<00:02:52.049> 2<00:02:52.260> e<00:02:52.290> 3

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
