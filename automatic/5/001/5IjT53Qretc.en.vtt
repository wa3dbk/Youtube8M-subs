00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.760 
that it's just some background art from
the<00:01:27.810> game<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.110> does<00:01:28.350> look<00:01:28.530> absolutely

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the game which does look absolutely

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
the game which does look absolutely
adorable<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> design<00:01:30.810> with

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
adorable in that kind of design with

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
adorable in that kind of design with
some<00:01:31.290> gems<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> jewels<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> stitching

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
some gems and jewels and the stitching

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
some gems and jewels and the stitching
work<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.810> looks<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.200> cool<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
work which looks really cool and just to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.580 
work which looks really cool and just to
take<00:01:35.430> note<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.299> care<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.079> height<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
take note if you care the height is the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
take note if you care the height is the
same<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> width<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.340> same<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.000> actually

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
same the width is the same but actually

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
same the width is the same but actually
the<00:01:39.479> depth<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.079> package<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> quite<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> bit

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the depth of this package is quite a bit

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
the depth of this package is quite a bit
different<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> yarn<00:01:42.329> Yoshi<00:01:42.570> amiibo

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
different I think the yarn Yoshi amiibo

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
different I think the yarn Yoshi amiibo
are<00:01:43.170> more<00:01:43.380> comparable<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.570> splatoon

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
are more comparable to the splatoon

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
are more comparable to the splatoon
amiibo<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.159> narrow

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
amiibo that are a little bit more narrow

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.010 
amiibo that are a little bit more narrow
in<00:01:47.759> terms<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> depth<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.899> you're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
in terms of depth so if you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.210 
in terms of depth so if you're
interested<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> box<00:01:49.680> packaging<00:01:49.890> that's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
interested in the box packaging that's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
interested in the box packaging that's
just<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> main<00:01:50.670> difference<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.240> still

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
just the main difference there still

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
just the main difference there still
isn't<00:01:51.899> intend<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> amiibo<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.189> bottom

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
isn't intend to amiibo on the bottom

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
isn't intend to amiibo on the bottom
here<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.180> obviously<00:01:54.479> has<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> official

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here this one obviously has the official

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
here this one obviously has the official
seal<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> quality<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.130> does<00:01:56.520> say<00:01:56.700> Nintendo<00:01:57.180> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
seal of quality it does say Nintendo in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.789 
seal of quality it does say Nintendo in
Australia<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.140> Tendo<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.560> Europe

on there and then on the back we do have

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
on there and then on the back we do have
a<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> different<00:02:01.710> design<00:02:01.829> what

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a little bit of a different design what

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.389

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
nice good color it's strange I wonder

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.110 
nice good color it's strange I wonder
how<00:04:55.919> they<00:04:56.009> pick<00:04:56.189> these<00:04:56.340> three<00:04:56.550> colors<00:04:56.939> but

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
how they pick these three colors but

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.339 
how they pick these three colors but
another<00:04:57.389> thing<00:04:57.599> that's<00:04:57.689> really<00:04:57.810> cool<00:04:57.990> with

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
another thing that's really cool with

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.189 
another thing that's really cool with
the<00:04:58.530> amiibo<00:04:59.340> in<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.150> game<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.750> other<00:05:00.900> things

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
the amiibo in the game and other things

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.350 
the amiibo in the game and other things
I<00:05:01.319> think<00:05:01.469> you<00:05:01.740> can<00:05:01.770> scan<00:05:02.129> in<00:05:02.280> different<00:05:02.669> amiibo

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
I think you can scan in different amiibo

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.689 
I think you can scan in different amiibo
and<00:05:03.569> you<00:05:03.629> can<00:05:03.750> get<00:05:03.960> up<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.379> Mario<00:05:04.800> Yoshi

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
and you can get up like a Mario Yoshi

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.490 
and you can get up like a Mario Yoshi
so<00:05:05.940> basically<00:05:06.270> Yoshi<00:05:06.659> will<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:07.020> wearing<00:05:07.409> an

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
so basically Yoshi will be wearing an

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.290 
so basically Yoshi will be wearing an
outfit<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.129> looks<00:05:08.280> exactly<00:05:08.580> like<00:05:08.789> what

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
outfit that looks exactly like what

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.839 
outfit that looks exactly like what
Mario<00:05:09.690> would<00:05:09.870> be<00:05:10.020> if<00:05:10.379> Mario<00:05:10.860> was<00:05:11.099> caked<00:05:11.610> or

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
Mario would be if Mario was caked or

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.149 
Mario would be if Mario was caked or
like<00:05:12.719> basically<00:05:13.289> put<00:05:13.949> on<00:05:14.069> top<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:15.379> Yoshi<00:05:16.379> in<00:05:17.039> a

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
like basically put on top of Yoshi in a

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.680 
like basically put on top of Yoshi in a
yarn<00:05:17.400> form<00:05:17.729> which<00:05:17.969> is<00:05:18.120> really<00:05:18.449> outstanding

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
yarn form which is really outstanding

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
of and I really wish Nintendo was

of and I really wish Nintendo was
allowing<00:06:22.620> these<00:06:22.710> to<00:06:22.979> come<00:06:23.129> to<00:06:23.219> North<00:06:23.430> America

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
allowing these to come to North America

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.399 
allowing these to come to North America
a<00:06:23.849> lot<00:06:24.060> earlier<00:06:24.360> than<00:06:24.419> they<00:06:24.599> were<00:06:24.659> making<00:06:25.199> us

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
a lot earlier than they were making us

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.629 
a lot earlier than they were making us
wait<00:06:25.589> a<00:06:25.620> few<00:06:25.800> more<00:06:25.949> months<00:06:26.099> than<00:06:26.339> the<00:06:26.430> rest<00:06:26.580> of

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
wait a few more months than the rest of

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.980 
wait a few more months than the rest of
the<00:06:26.699> world<00:06:26.819> really<00:06:26.940> doesn't<00:06:27.210> seem<00:06:27.300> fair<00:06:27.509> but

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
the world really doesn't seem fair but

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.170 
the world really doesn't seem fair but
this<00:06:28.139> pastel<00:06:28.710> color<00:06:28.979> blue<00:06:29.279> looks<00:06:29.520> really<00:06:29.940> cool

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
this pastel color blue looks really cool

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.089 
this pastel color blue looks really cool
I<00:06:30.449> think<00:06:30.690> the<00:06:30.839> different<00:06:31.319> color<00:06:31.529> choices<00:06:31.770> are

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
I think the different color choices are

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.040 
I think the different color choices are
not<00:06:32.669> strange<00:06:33.150> you<00:06:33.389> have<00:06:33.509> to<00:06:33.629> have<00:06:33.750> green<00:06:34.020> I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
not strange you have to have green I

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.139 
not strange you have to have green I
think<00:06:34.199> blue<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.069> pink<00:06:35.279> makes<00:06:35.580> sense<00:06:35.819> as<00:06:36.000> well

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149 
think blue and pink makes sense as well

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:37.610 
think blue and pink makes sense as well
especially<00:06:36.690> if<00:06:36.899> you're<00:06:36.990> trying<00:06:37.199> to<00:06:37.229> market<00:06:37.560> to

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
especially if you're trying to market to

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.649 
especially if you're trying to market to
different<00:06:38.039> people<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.550> boys<00:06:38.969> and<00:06:39.000> girls<00:06:39.449> into

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
different people to boys and girls into

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.390 
different people to boys and girls into
everyone<00:06:39.990> around

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
everyone around

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.580 
everyone around
world<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:41.060> course<00:06:41.330> you<00:06:41.479> can<00:06:41.660> probably<00:06:42.199> almost

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
world of course you can probably almost

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.070 
world of course you can probably almost
make<00:06:42.889> out<00:06:43.040> back<00:06:43.280> here<00:06:43.790> you<00:06:44.570> can<00:06:44.720> probably<00:06:44.900> make

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
make out back here you can probably make

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.749 
make out back here you can probably make
out<00:06:45.259> the<00:06:45.410> five<00:06:45.590> main<00:06:45.919> Yoshi<00:06:46.190> colors<00:06:46.520> that<00:06:46.669> I

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
out the five main Yoshi colors that I

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.770 
out the five main Yoshi colors that I
have<00:06:46.940> the<00:06:47.150> only<00:06:47.240> ones<00:06:47.449> that<00:06:47.509> we're<00:06:47.660> missing

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
have the only ones that we're missing

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.080 
have the only ones that we're missing
then<00:06:48.139> are<00:06:48.470> of<00:06:48.740> course<00:06:49.009> we<00:06:49.250> are<00:06:49.430> missing<00:06:49.699> red

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
then are of course we are missing red

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.610 
then are of course we are missing red
and<00:06:50.360> yellow<00:06:50.570> but<00:06:50.840> I<00:06:50.900> do<00:06:50.990> think<00:06:51.199> yellow<00:06:51.410> would

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
and yellow but I do think yellow would

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.749 
and yellow but I do think yellow would
have<00:06:51.710> looked<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:51.919> little<00:06:52.009> strange<00:06:52.400> so<00:06:52.490> I<00:06:52.580> think

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
have looked a little strange so I think

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.189 
have looked a little strange so I think
they<00:06:52.820> chose<00:06:52.970> really<00:06:53.330> really<00:06:53.630> good<00:06:53.750> colors<00:06:54.050> on

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
they chose really really good colors on

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.340 
they chose really really good colors on
these<00:06:54.320> they<00:06:54.860> do<00:06:54.919> look<00:06:55.280> absolutely<00:06:55.460> incredible

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
these they do look absolutely incredible

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.260 
these they do look absolutely incredible
they<00:06:57.350> are<00:06:57.380> worth<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.580> I<00:06:58.610> think<00:06:58.940> if<00:06:59.060> you<00:06:59.150> can

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
they are worth that I think if you can

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.420 
they are worth that I think if you can
find<00:06:59.449> it<00:06:59.570> for<00:06:59.690> roughly<00:06:59.990> 15<00:07:00.440> to<00:07:00.620> 20<00:07:00.919> dollars<00:07:01.039> if

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
find it for roughly 15 to 20 dollars if

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.189 
find it for roughly 15 to 20 dollars if
these<00:07:01.580> go<00:07:01.729> into<00:07:01.910> over<00:07:02.300> $20<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:02.960> don't<00:07:03.080> really

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
these go into over $20 I don't really

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.120 
these go into over $20 I don't really
think<00:07:03.380> they're<00:07:03.500> worth<00:07:03.650> it<00:07:03.770> they're<00:07:03.919> really

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
think they're worth it they're really

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.260 
think they're worth it they're really
really<00:07:04.250> tiny<00:07:04.490> but<00:07:04.699> keep<00:07:04.850> in<00:07:04.970> mind<00:07:05.000> they<00:07:05.210> do

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
really tiny but keep in mind they do

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.210 
really tiny but keep in mind they do
have<00:07:05.479> some<00:07:05.630> sort<00:07:05.810> of<00:07:05.840> an<00:07:06.139> electronic<00:07:06.889> chip<00:07:07.070> in

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
have some sort of an electronic chip in

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.100 
have some sort of an electronic chip in
there<00:07:07.370> which<00:07:07.759> increases<00:07:08.300> the<00:07:08.419> costs<00:07:08.750> on<00:07:08.900> these

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
there which increases the costs on these

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.499 
there which increases the costs on these
I<00:07:09.350> think<00:07:09.800> they're<00:07:10.160> absolutely<00:07:10.910> incredible

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
I think they're absolutely incredible

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.909 
I think they're absolutely incredible
and<00:07:11.780> of<00:07:11.930> course<00:07:12.110> the<00:07:12.259> word<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.530> I<00:07:12.590> keep<00:07:12.770> using

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
and of course the word that I keep using
