00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
to do so but yeah that's that's another

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.520 
to do so but yeah that's that's another
goal<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.990> wish<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.620> made<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:16.260> again<00:02:17.260> just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
goal which I wish I made and again just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250 
goal which I wish I made and again just
gives<00:02:17.800> me<00:02:17.890> extra<00:02:18.580> energy<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.720> more<00:02:20.020> go

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
gives me extra energy to go more go

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.090 
gives me extra energy to go more go
forward<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:28.420> had<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:29.080> makes<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.560> probably

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
forward we had this makes it probably

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.270

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
you know that you have to do you have to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.980 
you know that you have to do you have to
prove<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.770> really<00:02:42.070> for<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.670> all<00:02:43.209> year<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.870> it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
prove it really for for all year and it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.050 
prove it really for for all year and it
really<00:02:44.560> doesn't<00:02:44.980> matter<00:02:45.070> only<00:02:45.370> about<00:02:45.730> few

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
really doesn't matter only about few

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.300 
really doesn't matter only about few
tournaments<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.500> play<00:02:47.709> well<00:02:47.920> or<00:02:48.100> bad
