00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
know but the batteries are getting kind

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.530 
know but the batteries are getting kind
of<00:00:15.059> old

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
of old

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:28.080 
of old
so<00:00:16.170> you're<00:00:16.350> drilling

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.110 

anyways<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.200> dies<00:00:29.700> so<00:00:30.700> what<00:00:31.510> are<00:00:31.600> you<00:00:31.660> gonna<00:00:31.750> do

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
anyways it dies so what are you gonna do

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.870 
anyways it dies so what are you gonna do
you<00:00:34.120> don't<00:00:34.270> have<00:00:34.480> our<00:00:34.660> cordless<00:00:35.020> drill<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
you don't have our cordless drill you

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.160 
you don't have our cordless drill you
don't<00:00:37.060> have<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.300> if<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.600> forgot<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.930> bring

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
don't have you if you forgot to bring

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.660 
don't have you if you forgot to bring
your<00:00:38.500> drill<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:40.800> plug<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.010> or<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.520> don't

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
your drill that's plug in or you don't

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.280 
your drill that's plug in or you don't
have<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> generator<00:00:43.390> or<00:00:43.600> whatever<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.960> case<00:00:44.080> is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
have a generator or whatever the case is

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.080 
have a generator or whatever the case is
you<00:00:44.320> don't<00:00:44.559> have<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.860> so<00:00:45.700> I<00:00:46.290> made<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.470> this<00:00:48.090> is

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
you don't have it so I made this this is

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.440 
you don't have it so I made this this is
an<00:00:49.360> old<00:00:49.510> battery<00:00:49.809> box<00:00:50.050> very<00:00:50.650> light<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:52.420> I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
an old battery box very light and what I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.119 
an old battery box very light and what I
did<00:00:52.690> was<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:52.900> took<00:00:53.080> it<00:00:53.320> apart<00:00:53.559> fortunately

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
did was I took it apart fortunately

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.940 
did was I took it apart fortunately
skill<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.580> smart<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.320> four<00:00:56.530> holes<00:00:56.739> you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
skill was smart and the four holes you

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.150 
skill was smart and the four holes you
see<00:00:57.160> there<00:00:57.400> two<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.660> bottom<00:00:59.040> the<00:01:00.040> one

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
see there two on the bottom the one

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.600 
see there two on the bottom the one
right<00:01:00.339> there

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
right there

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.110 
right there
the<00:01:01.300> one<00:01:01.449> right<00:01:01.600> there<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.769> got<00:01:02.980> t9<00:01:03.760> Torx

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
the one right there it's got t9 Torx

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.580 
the one right there it's got t9 Torx
screws<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.570> took<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.839> apart<00:01:05.080> took<00:01:05.290> out<00:01:05.440> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
screws and I took it apart took out the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.820 
screws and I took it apart took out the
old<00:01:05.620> battery<00:01:06.070> cells<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.690> then<00:01:07.690> before<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.530> did

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
old battery cells and then before I did

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.580 
old battery cells and then before I did
that<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.340> took<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.450> voltmeter<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.350> saw

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
that I took the voltmeter to it and saw

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.830 
that I took the voltmeter to it and saw
what's<00:01:11.830> one<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.070> these<00:01:12.310> two<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:13.630> one<00:01:13.810> of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
what's one of these two which one of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.680 
what's one of these two which one of
these<00:01:13.930> two<00:01:14.170> pins<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:17.100> positive<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.250> negative

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
these two pins is positive and negative

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.940 
these two pins is positive and negative
and<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:19.900> one<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.260> positive<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.890> that

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
and this one is the positive and that

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.300 
and this one is the positive and that
one's<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.250> negative<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.530> then<00:01:23.920> this<00:01:24.100> one

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
one's the negative and and then this one

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.980 
one's the negative and and then this one
right<00:01:24.430> here<00:01:24.729> was<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.210> temperature<00:01:25.510> sensor

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
right here was the temperature sensor

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.330 
right here was the temperature sensor
for<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.770> battery<00:01:27.100> charger<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
for the battery charger so that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.370 
for the battery charger so that
obviously<00:01:30.490> didn't<00:01:31.270> get<00:01:31.540> connected<00:01:31.780> up<00:01:32.079> this

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
obviously didn't get connected up this

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.260 
obviously didn't get connected up this
well<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.280> particular<00:01:33.640> battery<00:01:33.969> case

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
well this this particular battery case

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.490 
well this this particular battery case
will<00:01:34.450> never<00:01:34.630> see<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.869> battery<00:01:35.110> charge<00:01:35.320> again

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
will never see the battery charge again

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920 
will never see the battery charge again
but<00:01:35.619> all<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.799> did<00:01:35.979> was<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:36.880> took<00:01:37.240> two<00:01:37.479> banana

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
but all I did was I just took two banana

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.569 
but all I did was I just took two banana
plugs<00:01:39.240> sockets<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.710> Frankenstein<00:01:42.340> this

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
plugs sockets and Frankenstein this

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.120 
plugs sockets and Frankenstein this
thing<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.329> I<00:01:43.630> thought<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.680> putting<00:01:44.860> them<00:01:45.039> on

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
thing so I thought of putting them on

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.670 
thing so I thought of putting them on
one<00:01:45.369> side<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.869> problem<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:47.590> you're

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
one side but the problem is when you're

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.289 
one side but the problem is when you're
using<00:01:47.860> drill<00:01:48.280> it's<00:01:48.490> gonna<00:01:48.640> shake<00:01:48.880> back<00:01:49.119> and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
using drill it's gonna shake back and

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.749 
using drill it's gonna shake back and
forth<00:01:49.539> when<00:01:49.719> you're<00:01:49.840> doing<00:01:50.049> things<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.369> and

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
forth when you're doing things so and

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.580 
forth when you're doing things so and
this<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.060> kind<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.299> worked<00:01:52.479> out<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.110> also<00:01:53.439> I

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this just kind of worked out and also I

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.289 
this just kind of worked out and also I
kept<00:01:53.950> them<00:01:54.070> separate<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:54.640> that's<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.149> way

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
kept them separate like that's that way

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.819 
kept them separate like that's that way
I<00:01:55.329> don't<00:01:55.750> accidentally<00:01:56.259> plug<00:01:56.560> in<00:01:56.680> and

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
I don't accidentally plug in and

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.260 
I don't accidentally plug in and
backwards<00:01:57.219> because<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.579> last<00:01:57.759> time<00:01:57.969> I<00:01:58.119> did

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
backwards because the last time I did

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.590 
backwards because the last time I did
that<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.600> another<00:01:58.780> drill<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.170> had<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.909> fried<00:02:01.329> the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
that to another drill I had it fried the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.330 
that to another drill I had it fried the
controller<00:02:02.320> circuitry<00:02:02.859> in<00:02:02.979> there<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.219> that

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
controller circuitry in there and that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.940 
controller circuitry in there and that
drill<00:02:03.609> never<00:02:03.789> worked<00:02:04.090> again<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.439> I<00:02:05.469> didn't<00:02:05.799> pry

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
drill never worked again so I didn't pry

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.319 
drill never worked again so I didn't pry
the<00:02:06.009> motor<00:02:06.280> obviously<00:02:06.880> because<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.149> motor

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
the motor obviously because the motor

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.620 
the motor obviously because the motor
goes<00:02:07.710> gets<00:02:08.710> current<00:02:09.550> for<00:02:09.850> both<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.300> both

to charge the batteries while I'm
operating<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.030> field<00:02:55.299> but<00:02:56.879> those<00:02:57.879> panels<00:02:58.269> are

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
operating the field but those panels are

operating the field but those panels are
this<00:02:58.629> does<00:02:58.870> still<00:02:59.110> still<00:02:59.349> service<00:02:59.650> purpose

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
this does still still service purpose

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.860 
this does still still service purpose
but<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.790> right<00:03:00.879> now<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.269> solar<00:03:01.510> panel<00:03:01.690> is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
but as of right now that solar panel is

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.350 
but as of right now that solar panel is
firmly<00:03:02.110> mountain<00:03:02.500> yard<00:03:02.709> but<00:03:02.890> anyway<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:04.299> you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
firmly mountain yard but anyway so you

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.699 
firmly mountain yard but anyway so you
get<00:03:04.540> out<00:03:04.629> there<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.260> don't<00:03:05.409> have<00:03:05.530> access

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
get out there and you don't have access

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.670 
get out there and you don't have access
to<00:03:06.040> AC<00:03:06.159> power<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.690> plug<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.109> into<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.319> side

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
to AC power you plug it into one side

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:18.860 
to AC power you plug it into one side
positive<00:03:09.489> on<00:03:09.879> this<00:03:10.030> side

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.979 

as<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.170> see<00:03:20.379> here<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:21.700> actually<00:03:21.940> kind<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.540> neat

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
as you see here is actually kind of neat

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.360 
as you see here is actually kind of neat
how<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.260> works<00:03:23.470> because<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:24.040> sit<00:03:24.250> there

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
how it works because you can sit there

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.570 
how it works because you can sit there
shake<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.730> back<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:24.909> forth<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:27.370> wires

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
shake it back and forth and the wires

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.280 
shake it back and forth and the wires
are<00:03:27.849> not<00:03:27.909> going<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.569> fall<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:31.170> connect<00:03:32.170> it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
are not going to fall out so connect it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.839 
are not going to fall out so connect it
up<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.620> battery<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.860> yes<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.459> cords<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
up to the battery and yes the cords a

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.930 
up to the battery and yes the cords a
bit<00:03:37.000> long<00:03:37.180> as<00:03:37.390> 14-gauge<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.849> know

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
bit long as 14-gauge but you know

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.759 
bit long as 14-gauge but you know
honestly<00:03:40.120> we<00:03:40.930> give<00:03:41.079> them<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.230> fact<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:41.650> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
honestly we give them the fact it's a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.410 
honestly we give them the fact it's a
skill<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:42.489> obviously<00:03:42.849> not<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.150> last

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
skill it's obviously not gonna last

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.270 
skill it's obviously not gonna last
forever<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.709> know<00:03:44.829> it's<00:03:44.950> gonna<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:45.159> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
forever you know it's gonna have a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.850 
forever you know it's gonna have a
little<00:03:45.400> bit<00:03:45.549> less<00:03:45.700> power<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.120> at<00:03:46.180> least<00:03:46.860> when

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
little bit less power but at least when

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.809 
little bit less power but at least when
you're<00:03:48.129> need<00:03:48.700> portable<00:03:49.269> power<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:51.670> do

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
you're need portable power and you do

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.039 
you're need portable power and you do
need<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> drill<00:03:52.269> something<00:03:52.599> out<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> field

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
need to drill something out in the field

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.020 
need to drill something out in the field
this<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:53.470> lot<00:03:53.620> easier<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.129> carry<00:03:54.340> than<00:03:54.670> a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
this is a lot easier to carry than a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.509 
this is a lot easier to carry than a
whole<00:03:55.510> bunch<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:55.870> extra<00:03:56.140> batteries<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:57.340> it's

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
whole bunch of extra batteries and it's

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.949 
whole bunch of extra batteries and it's
definitely<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.060> lot<00:03:58.180> easier<00:03:58.450> than<00:03:58.569> carrying<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
definitely a lot easier than carrying a

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.149 
definitely a lot easier than carrying a
generator<00:03:59.379> so<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.980> just<00:04:00.129> switch<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.340> out<00:04:02.159> kind

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
generator so you just switch it out kind

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:20.539 
generator so you just switch it out kind
of<00:04:03.250> hard<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.120> do<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.359> with<00:04:04.540> one<00:04:04.720> hand<00:04:13.620> just

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.129 

like<00:04:21.549> so

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
like so

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.230 
like so
and<00:04:23.680> then<00:04:23.830> make<00:04:24.069> sure<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.310> got<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.789> connections

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and then make sure I got the connections

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.029 
and then make sure I got the connections
right<00:04:25.449> that's<00:04:25.689> my<00:04:25.840> negative<00:04:26.289> that's<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
right that's my negative that's the

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:43.439 
right that's my negative that's the
positive<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:41.590> battery<00:04:41.979> lasts<00:04:42.250> or<00:04:43.180> I'm<00:04:43.270> tell

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
positive that battery lasts or I'm tell

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.020 
positive that battery lasts or I'm tell
you<00:04:43.479> motor<00:04:43.750> burns
