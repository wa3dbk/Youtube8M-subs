00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.880
 bonjour modala musyu 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.840
 our circus opens its doors again 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.490
 for all fans of the frivolous genre 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.619
 But today I have such a philosophical 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.330
 mood shock learn instead caustic 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.640
 comments talk about reasonable 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.410
 good eternal well and specifically 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 phenomenal feature of the world of 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.430
 tanks undermine farts this pretty 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.710
 mysterious phenomenon 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.590
 I managed to play a lot in my life 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.690
 different online shooter beginners 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.000
 from the first quake naturally not passed 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.050
 past me and counter-strike u over 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.079
 mature age 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.989
 played in team fortress 2 actively chased 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.120
 across the network are different strings and well and pvp in 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.670
 classical and mother drochilnya ket too 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 I didnâ€™t have time to sip 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.690
 I can remember such regular and 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.470
 powerful explosions my perdak and what 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.840
 happen 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 and drill into roll of tanks at all when 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.830
 humanity is on the verge 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.380
 energy crisis need to be sent 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.649
 fuck all sorts of thermonuclear geothermal 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.790
 other clever sources of energy 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.250
 any progressive-minded person 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.100
 must understand what the future is for ther 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.320
 rectal energy environmentally friendly 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 but at the same time the most powerful ass explosions 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.250
 virtual tank crews 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.690
 will be able to save us when oil runs out 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.440
 Wuhan gas 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.090
 uranium ore and firewood in the near forest 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.940
 need only come up as safe 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 convert this energy into electric self 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.799
 I hope that the first minds of mankind 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.180
 already working on solving this problem 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.340
 but you have to admit that 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.340
 uncontrollable thermal rectal explosions 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.170
 fraught with great danger 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 compare these ass blasts with a peaceful 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.820
 atom which in hiroshima and nagasaki was 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.799
 not so peaceful but let's still 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.280
 back to what happened in this 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.560
 the battle 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.950
 how could you wander attention this 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.379
 ruinberg huge 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.239
 no one went to Zelenka but not even 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.519
 looking at the same I ride the incredible 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.800
 pieces of shit called scout panther 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.110
 I somehow managed to drag in one hand 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.569
 not a whole flank now I still have to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.849
 defend the base on the one hand pleases 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.980
 that opponents don't see me but on the other 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.090
 The sides of the vaunted conical gun could 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.489
 would be and be more precise 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.349
 Well seriously what in this case meaning 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.300
 here's a panther recon if it is over all 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.209
 parameters already ordinary panthers 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.790
 okay now is the time to show miracles 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.160
 I still have a light tank 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.349
 high level with crew downloaded on 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.630
 masking and maximum visibility 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.180
 Of course I have coated optics 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.739
 also installed well and finally in 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.470
 I have these here 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.599
 wonderful bushes true i see she 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.150
 vile vrazhina rolled already too 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.959
 close so I drove off to safe 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.120
 15 meters and shoot inviz all for now 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.370
 goes great as soon as he starts 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.739
 approaching i will turn towards them 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.260
 bases you roll with another unexpected 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.299
 corners and taking advantage of the review 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.030
 I will continue to shoot you safe 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.519
 the distances i wear it for garbage 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.470
 how did he find me taste opaque 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.470
 bushes my ass help 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.470
 but
