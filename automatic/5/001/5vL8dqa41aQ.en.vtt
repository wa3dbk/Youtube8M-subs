00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
it well I have a very simple solution to

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.810 
it well I have a very simple solution to
that<00:00:27.609> it's<00:00:28.390> actually<00:00:28.779> very<00:00:28.960> easy<00:00:29.080> to<00:00:29.529> do<00:00:29.820> first

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
that it's actually very easy to do first

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.429 
that it's actually very easy to do first
thing<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.119> guys<00:00:31.300> are<00:00:31.449> going<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.660> need<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:32.019> the

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
thing you guys are going to need is the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.040 
thing you guys are going to need is the
Google<00:00:32.800> Chrome<00:00:33.070> browser<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.570> can<00:00:34.750> do<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.960> on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
Google Chrome browser you can do it on

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.540 
Google Chrome browser you can do it on
the<00:00:35.140> other<00:00:35.290> browsers<00:00:35.739> but<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.370> more

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
the other browsers but it is more

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.630 
the other browsers but it is more
difficult<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:37.059> navigate<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.890> concept<00:00:39.399> is<00:00:39.520> the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
difficult to navigate the concept is the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.610 
difficult to navigate the concept is the
same<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.059> you<00:00:40.090> can<00:00:40.270> try<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.510> if<00:00:40.660> you<00:00:40.780> want<00:00:40.989> but<00:00:41.559> I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
same so you can try it if you want but I

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.290 
same so you can try it if you want but I
think<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.070> would<00:00:42.190> be<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.370> lot<00:00:42.640> easier<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.210> just

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
think it would be a lot easier to just

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.850 
think it would be a lot easier to just
download<00:00:43.870> Chrome<00:00:44.170> if<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.440> don't<00:00:44.590> have<00:00:44.739> it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
download Chrome if you don't have it

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.240
