I<00:00:24.810> said<00:00:24.960> right<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:26.550> layout<00:00:27.119> right

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I said right there this layout right

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.189 
I said right there this layout right
here<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.160> I'm<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.340> sure<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> even<00:00:30.199> call

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
here is I'm not sure what to even call

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.179 
here is I'm not sure what to even call
it<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.500> don't<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.710> they're<00:00:31.980> kind<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it I don't know they're kind of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
it I don't know they're kind of
protecting<00:00:32.730> their<00:00:33.110> resources<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
protecting their resources but at the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
protecting their resources but at the
same<00:00:34.800> time<00:00:35.010> they're<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.460> leaving<00:00:35.640> things

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
same time they're just leaving things

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.080 
same time they're just leaving things
out<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.719> too<00:00:36.750> far<00:00:37.380> away<00:00:37.559> guys<00:00:38.430> don't<00:00:38.730> ever<00:00:38.820> do

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
out way too far away guys don't ever do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
out way too far away guys don't ever do
that<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.469> many<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> probably<00:00:40.710> think

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that because many of you probably think

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
that because many of you probably think
that<00:00:41.190> enemies<00:00:42.090> won't<00:00:42.210> see<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.540> oh<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:43.079> will

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that enemies won't see them oh they will

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.450 
that enemies won't see them oh they will
see<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.530> they'll<00:00:43.649> zoom<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.340> will

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
see them they'll zoom out and they will

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
see them they'll zoom out and they will
see<00:00:44.610> everything<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:46.289> corners<00:00:46.649> thing<00:00:46.920> only

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
see everything the corners thing only

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590 
see everything the corners thing only
works<00:00:47.629> if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.219> know<00:00:50.219> people<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.000> too<00:00:51.180> lazy<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
works if you know people are too lazy to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
works if you know people are too lazy to
zoom<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.100> putting<00:00:53.730> things

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
zoom out but if you are putting things

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
zoom out but if you are putting things
far<00:00:54.390> away<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:55.760> actual<00:00:56.760> walls<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:58.079> most

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
far away from your actual walls the most

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.580 
far away from your actual walls the most
likelihood<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.750> them<00:01:00.750> actually<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.379> being

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
likelihood of them actually not being

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.369 
likelihood of them actually not being
seen<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.370> slim<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> mean<00:01:04.320> by

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
seen is very slim so what do I mean by

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
seen is very slim so what do I mean by
that<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.860> put<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.570> buildings<00:01:06.570> really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that well put your buildings really

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.440 
that well put your buildings really
close<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> walls<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.799> way<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
close to the walls that way that your

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240 
close to the walls that way that your
defenses<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.140> reach<00:01:10.290> them<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.920> ahead<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
defenses can reach them so go ahead and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
defenses can reach them so go ahead and
tap<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.460> cannon<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> circle

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
tap your cannon and see if that circle

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
tap your cannon and see if that circle
covers<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> area<00:01:15.420> where<00:01:15.600> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
covers all of the area where your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
covers all of the area where your
buildings<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.220> necessary<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
buildings are and it's not necessary to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
buildings are and it's not necessary to
have<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.290> fifty

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
have all of them in but more than fifty

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
have all of them in but more than fifty
percent<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
percent for sure because that is how the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.929 
percent for sure because that is how the

barbarian Archer attack strategy easily
works<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.450> spread<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.619> get

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
works you just spread them out and get

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
works you just spread them out and get
fifty<00:01:26.009> percent<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.740> let's<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.890> how<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.220> we

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
fifty percent and let's see how are we

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.609 
fifty percent and let's see how are we
doing<00:01:29.549> uh<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.329> promised<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.079> gold<00:01:31.259> which

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
this base isn't too upgraded but you

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.830 
this base isn't too upgraded but you
know<00:04:54.280> due<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.729> its<00:04:54.789> down<00:04:55.000> Holly<00:04:55.270> can't<00:04:55.569> really

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
know due to its down Holly can't really

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.559 
know due to its down Holly can't really
upgrade<00:04:56.199> for<00:04:56.949> too<00:04:57.340> much<00:04:57.520> these<00:04:58.120> walls<00:04:58.389> are

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
upgrade for too much these walls are

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.180 
upgrade for too much these walls are
very<00:04:58.690> easy<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.020> break<00:04:59.289> about<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.009> wall

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
very easy to break about just to wall

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.110 
very easy to break about just to wall
breakers<00:05:00.610> will<00:05:00.759> do<00:05:02.909> their<00:05:03.909> air<00:05:04.090> defenses

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
breakers will do their air defenses

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.879 
breakers will do their air defenses
right<00:05:05.020> over<00:05:05.289> there<00:05:05.469> and<00:05:05.620> it's<00:05:05.740> under

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
right over there and it's under

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.980 
right over there and it's under
construction<00:05:06.159> so<00:05:06.759> we<00:05:06.909> absolutely<00:05:07.449> don't<00:05:07.810> need

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
construction so we absolutely don't need

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.779 
construction so we absolutely don't need
to<00:05:08.080> worry<00:05:08.199> about<00:05:08.379> that<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.430> their<00:05:09.550> only

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
to worry about that that is their only

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.320 
to worry about that that is their only
air<00:05:10.120> defence<00:05:10.509> so<00:05:11.909> this<00:05:12.909> could<00:05:13.120> be<00:05:13.300> a

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
air defence so this could be a

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.230 
air defence so this could be a
three-star<00:05:13.870> their<00:05:14.800> minds<00:05:15.460> are<00:05:15.639> very<00:05:15.969> easily

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
three-star their minds are very easily

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.350 
three-star their minds are very easily
exposed<00:05:16.979> they<00:05:17.979> do<00:05:18.039> not<00:05:18.340> possess<00:05:18.610> more<00:05:19.060> gold

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
exposed they do not possess more gold

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.600 
exposed they do not possess more gold
than<00:05:19.599> collector<00:05:20.469> so<00:05:20.770> we<00:05:20.979> will<00:05:21.099> have<00:05:21.159> to<00:05:21.400> get<00:05:21.490> to

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
than collector so we will have to get to

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.709 
than collector so we will have to get to
the<00:05:21.699> collectors<00:05:22.090> but<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.479> should<00:05:22.599> be<00:05:22.629> a

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
the collectors but that should be a

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.360 
the collectors but that should be a
piece<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.930> cake<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.469> want<00:05:24.129> you<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.280> pay

attention do you see how that middle

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.980 
attention do you see how that middle
area<00:05:26.289> is<00:05:26.560> completely<00:05:27.330> exposed<00:05:28.330> once<00:05:28.900> you

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
area is completely exposed once you

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.510 
area is completely exposed once you
break<00:05:29.169> two<00:05:29.380> walls<00:05:29.620> there's<00:05:30.039> like<00:05:30.219> the<00:05:30.340> Town

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
it all around because even even
