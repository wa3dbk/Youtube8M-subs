00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello everyone with you bartolomeo today 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 we will do what we will do 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 did you share I see you have a tanker with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 matter 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.980
 yes, well, today I will tell you how 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 by it got like we will dump with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.469
 using mod thermal expand that is us 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.129
 tankers required to be crafted from 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.410
 pieces of copper and glass and pipes too 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.020
 most kraft copper glass there and it seems 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.420
 would be a little sly needed or not in general 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 pipes need not necessarily such even 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 normal fit we need a system 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 which will consist of two columns but 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.559
 you don't even need two columns 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.600
 feed in a different way can be a whole chain 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.859
 make the main thing that she was like this 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 of course you can experiment 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.650
 maybe you can do it differently 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 do it dupe our player on us 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.080
 Oleg dinner server and told on the very 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 We have already written to developers 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.650
 when not fix it but not yet 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 fixed some servers 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.900
 use old versions you can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 dupat 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 Now I will show how to take any 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.400
 liquid you want lava water not 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.439
 I know oil well, anything we want 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.530
 dupe matter matter dear matter 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.680
 valuable as we will do we fill 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 mother's tanker and so here he is asking 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.409
 full but there still a little bit missing 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 I think it was fine and we open 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.100
 Knee off Mr. Mr. to us no longer 0 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.040
 all system is built we will need 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 open tankers so they transfuse 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.579
 I opened such a great question and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.890
 will have to come here now I open this 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.320
 this can be closed for example it is now 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.979
 shimmers in this tank that is here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.510
 such as communicating vessels are obtained 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.120
 just distillation happens here then 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.340
 There is 1 tanker in another but here and so 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.950
 chasing here and there and come on now! 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.810
 close both tanker see here for another 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.870
 I also appear on top now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 check how many players understand here 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
 we have two tankers 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 one of them is full 8000 in the second she 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.980
 180 miles and baguettes in one bucket with us 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.980
 it turns out 1000 miles to fuck this one here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.799
 hooked back and opening on the very 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.049
 You can even turn them both off well 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.849
 sense to open and let her chase then 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.880
 have you go about your business can 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.220

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.620
 we will wait well how can she give just 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 will will will be included and through 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.859
 some time its becoming 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 more more more another option 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.180
 you can just stand and press constantly 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.239
 it will be fixed open and closed simply 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.060
 so here to press some say 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.319

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.739
 open close you further already 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.440
