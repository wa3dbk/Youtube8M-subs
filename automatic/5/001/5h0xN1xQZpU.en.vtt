00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:22.250
 hi everyone guys here is riccardo 9 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 995 and today I will teach you how to do anything 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.870
 don't care about it minecraft while 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.110
 we record with fraps then for those who do not 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:36.210
 had it still I leave the link in 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.860
 description of the program and nothing 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.760
 then I would say to immediately start the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 tutor doing by showing a thing 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.220
 then why does he own the computer 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.050
 slow but slow slow 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.540
 excuse me for a moment and I have to raise a mountain 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 of things then just go to the panel 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.200
 program control and on java go 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.829
 on already this is one more thing for 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.130
 own slow computers and here on 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:11.400
 control panel make category 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.570
 csaba displays the parameters here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 routine 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.060
 what would have come to mind as the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 computer must run this game 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.260
 obviously this is the only one I don't know 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 still because I don't know yet why me 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.720
 I recommend going to the system and here 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.150
 you will have to write 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.439
 now I do nothing because so much for 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 it's useless 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.979
 I show it on the notepad and it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.010
 I find it says too much stuff that knows it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.650
 block I'll have to know 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.759
 here then I immediately show you 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.549
 you have to make the dash next to it 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:59.640
 point hicks uppercase mx and for example 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.759
 now let's start right click on 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 computer ownership in this case 4 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.700
 gigabytes of ram so I can do 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.670
 mx hicks which is the maximum 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.130
 4000 mah I would say to leave a little 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.390
 space and make 3000 3500 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:25.360
 then make space dash hicks uppercase 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 ms and do not know 3000 2005 more or less 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.830
 it depends how much you want to run the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.360
 game 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.760
 however you have to write this for 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.350
 for that thing but not for everyone 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.650
 because you have to have I don't know that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 4 GB of poor ram and with a processor 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 lousy as well as mine both better 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 anyway then I would say now 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.440
 stop recording with 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 camtasia and take the one with fraps for 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.460
 let see just how to do it though 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.920
 I want to open before I start 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.310
 minecraft yes just really love us 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:16.540
 I wanted to write ok now the race is launched 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.170
 so the menu and when you will say so 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.910
 even later when you are on the menu not 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.700
 start recording when 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.610
 are you menu do it as soon as you are inside a 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 server or a single player world 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:41.040
 it depends on what you want to do and before 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 turn on installed fraps and then turn it on 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 you will select the minecraft page 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.120
 automatically not started a 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.360
 record now because it will then leave you the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.640
 world what I say so immediately 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.390
 then either lame and start again with france 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.819
 ok guys we're on minecraft in this 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.500
 case we are in the hunger games server 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.389
 because I do n't know, I wanted to try a server 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.489
 so anyways guys I'm doing with 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:18.989
 rendering distance only graphic 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.780
 sophisticated rendering normal clouds on 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.750
 minimal oscillating visual abe particles 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.949
 if it were let's try breeding now here 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.080
 look look 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.550
 look like photos with distance 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.030
 normal rendering I only say one thing 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.630
 in mine is a non-prehistoric computer of 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:48.729
 more belonged to when god was born 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:51.039
 vv i don't know anyway it's a computer is a 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.500
 computer that really sucks 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:05:00.090
 in terms of performance and therefore I have to 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.949
 just for the greener now 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.560
 will definitely be fine 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.199
 surely anyway if the grete in a 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.310
 server bukit remember and remember that 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.260
 if you do more or less around 12 fps that 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.550
 also happened to me in mine is for 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.520
 the fault of the connection 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.080
 because for that I am entered inside 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.750
 the hunger games because less 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.169
 there was a connection is good and you can 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.560
 just test this one here 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.409
 in short this this thing gold off the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.580
 moro and in any case there is also to count 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.510
 we have a skin of in hd here is how much 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.530
 gold 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.909
 we also have a skin in hd so 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:48.340
 let's say the thing for my computer 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.210
 it should be very complicated is not 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.610
 so just because 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.560
 as I said before if it starts 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.370
 record at least starts to widen or 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.729
 news ass 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.940
 but not so in so it works 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.280
 very well I really found out 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.160
 so here we expect you 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.690
 of the things of the hunger games episodes 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.490
 and day 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.759
 I do n't know a series with a friend of mine I would like 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.220
 but do if the server works 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:20.009
 now we are trying to solve some 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.900
 problem anyway me guys from this 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.259
