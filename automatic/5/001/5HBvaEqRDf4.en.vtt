00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
how it works I can't really explain it
I'm<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:38.969> very<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.660> explaining<00:00:40.170> crap<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
I'm not very good at explaining crap so

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000 
I'm not very good at explaining crap so
I<00:00:41.579> use<00:00:42.239> sticky<00:00:42.570> pistons<00:00:42.960> I'll<00:00:43.559> show<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> real

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I use sticky pistons I'll show you real

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.910 
I use sticky pistons I'll show you real
fat<00:00:44.160> won't<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.640> away<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.230> use<00:00:46.230> sticky<00:00:46.530> pistons

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
fat won't go away I use sticky pistons

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.000 
fat won't go away I use sticky pistons
to<00:00:47.460> pull<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> blocks<00:00:48.420> away<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.800> here

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to pull the blocks away as you see here

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.930 
to pull the blocks away as you see here
and<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> basically<00:00:52.530> those<00:00:53.399> pull<00:00:53.699> away<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and so basically those pull away the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.600 
and so basically those pull away the
blocks<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.559> below<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> blocks<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.460> lava

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
blocks and then below the blocks or lava

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
blocks and then below the blocks or lava
and<00:00:57.390> there's<00:00:57.629> nothing<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> chest<00:00:58.170> by<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and there's nothing in the chest by the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.840 
and there's nothing in the chest by the
way<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> let's<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.469> whoops<00:01:04.850> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
way so let's get out of here whoops it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
way so let's get out of here whoops it's
very<00:01:06.090> complicated<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.170> can't<00:01:07.439> explain

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
very complicated I really can't explain

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
very complicated I really can't explain
it<00:01:08.720> too<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.409> basically<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> ran<00:01:12.000> redstone

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it too good a basically I ran redstone

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
it too good a basically I ran redstone
wiring<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:15.320> fix<00:01:16.580> yes<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.790> am

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
wiring I don't have any fix yes I am

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
wiring I don't have any fix yes I am
using<00:01:18.270> inventory<00:01:18.479> editor<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:21.890> kind<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
using inventory editor because I kind of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
using inventory editor because I kind of
got<00:01:22.979> bored<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> minecraft<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.030> basically

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
got bored out of minecraft so basically

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
as you can see here I have redstone

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.160 
as you can see here I have redstone
wiring<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.299> down<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> end<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
wiring all the way down to the end of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.210 
wiring all the way down to the end of
the<00:01:28.259> Pistons<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:30.570> both<00:01:30.840> sides<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.070> got

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.480 
the Pistons on both sides and then I got
a<00:01:32.250> repeater<00:01:32.610> under<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:34.280> give<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a repeater under here to give it a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.440 
a repeater under here to give it a
little<00:01:35.670> bit<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> delay<00:01:36.829> towards<00:01:38.360> when<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
little bit of a delay towards when the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.800 
little bit of a delay towards when the
door<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.630> open<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.240> or<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> piston<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
door is open so or when the piston is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.600 
door is open so or when the piston is
open<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.170> sorry<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.090> works

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
open I'm sorry so that's how that works
