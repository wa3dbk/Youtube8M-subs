liters<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.510> hour<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.219> cheap

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
liters an hour I think but it's cheap

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
liters an hour I think but it's cheap
and<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.359> backup<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.110> help

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and it's really just a backup to help

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890 
and it's really just a backup to help
polish<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:05.220> water<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.880> primarily<00:01:06.450> that's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
polish my water so primarily that's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.440 
polish my water so primarily that's
what's<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:08.450> polishing

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
what's going to be in it as polishing

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.740 
what's going to be in it as polishing
media<00:01:10.549> instead<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> biological<00:01:12.390> although

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
media instead of biological although

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
media instead of biological although
there<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.380> biological<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.340> there

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
there will be some biological in there

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
there will be some biological in there
and<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.360> I'll<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.799> taking<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.159> k1<00:01:17.640> from

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and because I'll be taking at my k1 from

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.800 
and because I'll be taking at my k1 from
here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.380 
here
I'm<00:01:18.900> putting<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.390> hanging

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I'm putting some of that in the hanging

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
I'm putting some of that in the hanging
on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.500> added<00:01:23.490> some<00:01:23.640> new<00:01:24.000> widths

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
on the back so I added some new widths

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
on the back so I added some new widths
the<00:01:24.420> other<00:01:24.659> piece<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> had<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.619> didn't<00:01:26.580> think

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the other piece I had I didn't think

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.719 
the other piece I had I didn't think
that<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> went<00:01:28.049> too<00:01:28.259> well<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.829> scape<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that it went too well with my scape so I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
that it went too well with my scape so I
took<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> replaced<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.140> these

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
took out and I replaced it with these

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.580 
took out and I replaced it with these
two<00:01:31.560> pieces<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> right<00:01:32.579> hand<00:01:32.790> side<00:01:33.060> there

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
two pieces on the right hand side there

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
two pieces on the right hand side there
just<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> brings<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.220> different<00:01:35.659> kind<00:01:36.659> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
just kind of brings a different kind of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.149 
just kind of brings a different kind of
level<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> scape<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> wanted<00:01:37.950> something

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
level to the scape I wanted something

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.020 
level to the scape I wanted something
low-lying<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.320> somewhere<00:01:40.320> where<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.030> Rams

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
low-lying and somewhere where the Rams

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
low-lying and somewhere where the Rams
in<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> keyholes<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.960> tighter<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:44.159> now

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
in the keyholes go tighter and right now

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
in the keyholes go tighter and right now
my<00:01:44.549> Rams<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:45.000> hiding<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:46.049> at

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
my Rams are hiding in it I think or at
