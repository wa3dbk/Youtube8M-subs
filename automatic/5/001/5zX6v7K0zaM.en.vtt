the bores right now and you see that
it's<00:00:15.060> not<00:00:15.150> doing<00:00:15.420> well<00:00:15.720> we<00:00:16.230> look<00:00:16.379> at<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.620> base

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
it's not doing well we look at the base

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.860 
it's not doing well we look at the base

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the base of the tree we see the real

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
the base of the tree we see the real
problem<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> borer<00:00:25.680> has<00:00:25.890> attacked<00:00:26.279> the

problem when the borer has attacked the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
problem when the borer has attacked the
tree<00:00:26.850> it<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.510> produce<00:00:27.690> a<00:00:27.960> jelly-like<00:00:28.320> sap

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
tree it will produce a jelly-like sap

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890 
tree it will produce a jelly-like sap
indicating<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> there's<00:00:30.119> more<00:00:30.359> activity

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
indicating that there's more activity

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.290 
indicating that there's more activity
here<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.250> sap<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> other<00:00:32.880> places<00:00:33.149> on

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
here you can see sap and other places on

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.639 
here you can see sap and other places on
the<00:00:33.360> tree<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.720> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> glob<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the tree but this is the glob that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.900 
the tree but this is the glob that
really<00:00:34.829> indicates<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> peach<00:00:35.520> tree<00:00:35.700> borer

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
really indicates the peach tree borer

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
really indicates the peach tree borer
even<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.720> you<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.899> find<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.440> bore<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
even when you don't find the bore in the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
even when you don't find the bore in the
jelly<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.399> sap<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.880> know<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
jelly like sap you know there's a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.040 
jelly like sap you know there's a
problem<00:00:39.540> here

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
problem here

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
problem here
so<00:00:40.380> you're<00:00:40.470> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> need<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> something

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
so you're going to need to do something

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
so you're going to need to do something
to<00:00:41.550> control<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.970> problem<00:00:42.180> leanne<00:00:43.020> Mero

this problem Leanne how can someone deal

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
this problem Leanne how can someone deal
organically<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.290> peach<00:00:52.440> tree<00:00:52.649> bores<00:00:52.860> well

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
organically with peach tree bores well

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
organically with peach tree bores well
one<00:00:53.730> method<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> control<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:54.989> insect

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
one method of control is using insect

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
one method of control is using insect
parasitic<00:00:56.010> nematodes<00:00:56.550> nematodes<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.450> like

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
parasitic nematodes nematodes that like

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
parasitic nematodes nematodes that like
root-knot<00:00:58.079> nematodes<00:00:58.559> no<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.399> not

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
root-knot nematodes no right not

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
root-knot nematodes no right not
nematodes<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> plant<00:01:00.690> parasite<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.800> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
nematodes are a plant parasite these are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
nematodes are a plant parasite these are
parasites<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.760> insects<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.629> don't

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
parasites of insects so they don't

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.710 
parasites of insects so they don't
bother<00:01:03.899> people<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.489> earthworms<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bother people no or earthworms so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
bother people no or earthworms so
they're<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.900> everything<00:01:07.409> except<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> bad

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
they're not everything except the bad

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
they're not everything except the bad
guys<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:08.940> specific

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
guys up right they're very specific

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.109 
guys up right they're very specific
within<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> range<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.229> insects<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.940> what

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
within a range of insects as to what

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.390 
within a range of insects as to what
they<00:01:12.240> parasitize<00:01:12.840> they're<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> styrofoam

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
they parasitize they're in a styrofoam

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
they parasitize they're in a styrofoam
box<00:01:14.600> inside<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> cardboard<00:01:15.990> box<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
box inside the cardboard box that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
box inside the cardboard box that
preserves<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.689> are

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
preserves them because they are

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
preserves them because they are
perishable<00:01:19.380> living<00:01:20.310> organism<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.780> we'll<00:01:21.960> just

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
perishable living organism so we'll just

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
perishable living organism so we'll just
unpack<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> box<00:01:24.350> you'll<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.439> ice<00:01:25.890> packs

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
unpack the box you'll see ice packs

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
unpack the box you'll see ice packs
these<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> keep<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> nematodes<00:01:27.780> cool<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
these are to keep the nematodes cool in

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
these are to keep the nematodes cool in
transit<00:01:28.979> they're<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.670> temperature

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
transit they're very temperature

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.929 
transit they're very temperature
sensitive<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:31.560> remove<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> sponges<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
sensitive just remove the sponges and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
sensitive just remove the sponges and
place<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> water<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:35.310> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
place them into the water you're just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.420 
place them into the water you're just
going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> gently<00:01:36.290> work<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> sponges<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090 
water until the nematodes the spurts out
of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> sponge<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.900> what<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.439> okay

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of the sponge so what do we do now okay

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
of the sponge so what do we do now okay
after<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.939> receive<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.689> know

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
after you receive them and you know

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
after you receive them and you know
they're<00:01:46.020> cold<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.939> leave<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.329> out

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
they're cold you can just leave them out

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179 
they're cold you can just leave them out
at<00:01:48.840> room<00:01:49.049> temperature<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.530> always<00:01:49.890> leave<00:01:50.070> them

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
at room temperature I always leave them

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.340 
at room temperature I always leave them
facedown<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> moisture<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> next<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
facedown so the moisture is next to the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
facedown so the moisture is next to the
nematodes<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.670> 15<00:01:54.150> minutes<00:01:54.360> until

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
nematodes for about 15 minutes until

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
nematodes for about 15 minutes until
they<00:01:54.869> begin<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> warm<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.790> next<00:01:57.030> we're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
they begin to warm up so next we're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.569 
they begin to warm up so next we're
going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.770> talk<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> methods<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
going to talk about the methods of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
going to talk about the methods of
application<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.110> either<00:02:01.290> apply<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
application you can either apply with a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.179 
application you can either apply with a
hand<00:02:02.579> watering<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.450> let's<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.259> stir<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
hand watering can let's just stir up the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.380 
hand watering can let's just stir up the
nematodes<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:06.000> sure<00:02:06.119> they're<00:02:06.270> well

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
nematodes to make sure they're well

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.389 
nematodes to make sure they're well
dispersed<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.140> pour<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:07.890> around<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.249> base

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
dispersed and pour them around the base

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.140 
dispersed and pour them around the base
of<00:02:08.639> the<00:02:08.700> tree<00:02:08.969> okay<00:02:09.659> or<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.499> use<00:02:11.150> syringes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of the tree okay or you can use syringes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
of the tree okay or you can use syringes
if<00:02:12.389> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.749> find<00:02:13.049> holes

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
if you can find holes

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.320 
if you can find holes
in<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> barque<00:02:14.460> where<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.910> tunneled

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
in the barque where they have tunneled

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.280 
in the barque where they have tunneled
you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.660> just<00:02:16.320> draw<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.620> nematodes<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.460> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you can just draw the nematodes up and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.230 
you can just draw the nematodes up and
stick<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> tip<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> hole<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
stick the tip in the in the hole in the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.020 
stick the tip in the in the hole in the
tree<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.740> inject<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> nematodes<00:02:23.310> okay

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
tree and inject the nematodes okay

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.600 
tree and inject the nematodes okay
or<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.990> use<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> backpack<00:02:25.650> sprayer<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
or you can use a backpack sprayer or a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.100 
or you can use a backpack sprayer or a
handheld<00:02:27.000> backpack<00:02:27.510> sprayer<00:02:27.840> these

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
handheld backpack sprayer these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830 
handheld backpack sprayer these
nematodes<00:02:28.320> can<00:02:28.890> withstand<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> 300<00:02:30.330> psi

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
nematodes can withstand up to 300 psi

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.230 
nematodes can withstand up to 300 psi
well<00:02:31.380> most<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.890> these<00:02:32.010> operated<00:02:32.580> about<00:02:32.700> 10<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
well most of these operated about 10 to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.590 
well most of these operated about 10 to
15<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.500> you're<00:02:35.040> safe<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.580> way<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.330> have

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
15 so you're safe that way you just have

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.480 
15 so you're safe that way you just have
to<00:02:36.720> make<00:02:36.870> sure<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.470> remove<00:02:37.740> any<00:02:37.950> filters

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
to make sure that you remove any filters

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.340 
to make sure that you remove any filters
that<00:02:38.670> might<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.750> nozzle<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that might be in the in the nozzle and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.280 
that might be in the in the nozzle and
check<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.310> inside<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.030> tank<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.570> make<00:02:43.140> sure

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
check down inside the tank and make sure

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.720 
check down inside the tank and make sure
there<00:02:43.440> are<00:02:43.530> no<00:02:43.620> filters<00:02:44.040> where<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.340> comes<00:02:44.550> up

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
there are no filters where it comes up

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.240 
there are no filters where it comes up
into<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> hose<00:02:45.330> okay<00:02:45.959> let's<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> okay

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
into the hose okay let's go do it okay

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
into the hose okay let's go do it okay
let's<00:02:47.490> use<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.700> watering<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.150> today<00:02:48.390> all

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
let's use the watering can today all

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.400 
let's use the watering can today all
right

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
right

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.110 
right
this<00:02:50.130> Peachtree<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.700> having<00:02:50.970> some<00:02:51.090> problems

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
this Peachtree is having some problems

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.680 
this Peachtree is having some problems
with<00:02:51.450> bores<00:02:51.950> yeah<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:54.570> what

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
with bores yeah I can see that so what

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.160 
with bores yeah I can see that so what
do<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.840> do

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
do we do

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
do we do
well<00:02:55.410> let's<00:02:55.739> apply<00:02:56.220> nematodes<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:57.090> around

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
well let's apply nematodes right around

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.380 
well let's apply nematodes right around
the<00:02:57.540> base<00:02:57.720> okay<00:02:58.260> how<00:02:59.040> do<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.520> um<00:03:00.030> we're

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the base okay how do we do that um we're

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.690 
the base okay how do we do that um we're
going<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.690> stir<00:03:01.020> up<00:03:01.050> our<00:03:01.700> resuspended

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
going to stir up our resuspended

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.660 
going to stir up our resuspended
contents<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> nematodes<00:03:03.930> are<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.670> well

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
contents so the nematodes are are well

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.430 
contents so the nematodes are are well
mixed<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:06.660> we're<00:03:06.780> going<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.020> pour<00:03:07.260> them

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
mixed and then we're going to pour them

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.430 
mixed and then we're going to pour them
into<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> watering<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.350> we'll<00:03:10.350> apply

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
into the watering can and we'll apply

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.210 
into the watering can and we'll apply
them<00:03:10.890> right<00:03:10.920> around<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.459> base<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.880> tree

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
them right around the base of the tree

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.920 
them right around the base of the tree
it's<00:03:14.220> important<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.850> your<00:03:14.880> application<00:03:15.690> in

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's important to do your application in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.810 
it's important to do your application in
the<00:03:16.080> evening<00:03:16.560> or<00:03:16.770> when<00:03:17.070> it's<00:03:17.220> cloudy<00:03:17.580> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
the evening or when it's cloudy and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.210 
the evening or when it's cloudy and
raining<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:19.080> moisture<00:03:19.739> helps

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
raining like it is now moisture helps

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.970 
raining like it is now moisture helps
yeah<00:03:20.610> okay<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.510> important<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> have<00:03:22.170> damp

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
yeah okay it's important to have damp

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.009 
yeah okay it's important to have damp
ground<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.670> facilitates<00:03:24.390> their<00:03:24.600> movement

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
ground it facilitates their movement

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.900 
ground it facilitates their movement
down<00:03:25.200> into<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.620> soil<00:03:25.830> profile<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.640> how<00:03:26.760> big

okay<00:03:36.930> bores<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.560> comes<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.769> go

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
okay bores here it comes so you just go

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.400 
okay bores here it comes so you just go
around<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.160> apply<00:03:41.430> fairly<00:03:42.090> quickly<00:03:42.410> it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
around and apply fairly quickly it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.590 
around and apply fairly quickly it
doesn't<00:03:43.799> hurt<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.820> water<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
doesn't hurt to get the water and

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.900 
doesn't hurt to get the water and
nematode<00:03:46.260> suspension<00:03:46.830> right<00:03:46.950> onto<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> bark

nematode suspension right onto the bark
these<00:03:48.660> are<00:03:48.870> microscopic<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:50.040> some<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.340> them

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
these are microscopic so some of them

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.070 
these are microscopic so some of them
will<00:03:51.540> move<00:03:51.840> into<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:54.030> areas<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.840> any

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
will move into the areas that have any

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.250

kind of break in the bark or damaged and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.840 
kind of break in the bark or damaged and
get<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.860> larvae<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.220> way

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
get to the larvae that way

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.610 
get to the larvae that way
that<00:04:00.330> was<00:04:00.450> really<00:04:00.630> easy<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:01.350> there<00:04:01.470> anything

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
that was really easy is there anything

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.410 
that was really easy is there anything
else<00:04:01.860> we<00:04:01.950> need<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.100> know<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.430> when<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:03.090> should

else we need to know like when we should

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.750 
else we need to know like when we should
do<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.660> yes<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.860> important<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.400> apply<00:04:05.640> the
