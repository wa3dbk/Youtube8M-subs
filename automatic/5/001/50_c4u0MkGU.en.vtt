 energy 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.390

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.670
 we will not give them the products of the market 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.320
 hope that he 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.960
 17 families were reported at the bridge 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.830
 so who go to contact and this is already 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.220
 convention 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.160
 I would not take the animals very bad 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.050
 position idea 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.270
 poor material conditions 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.390
 bad acting position basically 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.050
 inflation 7 and a lot of children 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 hotels she courageously ill 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920
 but of course they will be happy 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 because 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.180

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.729
 promised all the help promises i think it 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.370
 concept of such lists 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.820
 books did not change the number of families 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.010
 the village but no one at all to meet 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.100
 show 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.710

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.360

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.000
 moral support 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.510

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.820
