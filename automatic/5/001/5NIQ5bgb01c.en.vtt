00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Halli hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.160
 new episode of the 14 k mode with prof and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.719
 no, of course he is not finished 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.950
 now just because the harmony started 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.570
 but it is somehow clear that you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
 if you start one person first 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.719
 you have to cut out with it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 can get used to it a bit and that's why 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.180
 Of course, there is no need to worry 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.269
 finished by now but I want to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 to be completely honest and that's it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.689
 also somewhere his reason for 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
 so plymouth then came less last 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.309
 just like me 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 compare with the Eintrachtler mode 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.930
 to play with the concord or someone 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 plew tanja makes it clear already 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.780
 much more fun with the easy too 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 play because they are the better ones 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.370
 Of course, players now have yes 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 just the cash quality difference 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 but yes, the whole is then if so 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.690
 you then played with clever so from 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 Because you say while we're here in the game 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 against stoke and material only hits the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.480
 post 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.879
 yes then so then you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.590
 suddenly played god the player 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 can not do anything bad at all 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 first has that all extremely slow and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.760
 so on and so on and then you say 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 somehow all this is happening now 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.299
 not so much fun there I take 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 but rather eintracht plays dearman 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.890
 round with the concord and have one 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 So, let's see a little more fun 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 how the whole thing continues 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 but definitely not finished 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 the letter career mode that could be 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 he comes as more irregular than that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 eintracht we are residue-10 is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.189
 in the 74 minute or something 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 completely enters kister jo meets us 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.840
 So both career will be mose 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 continue to be and we will 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 let's see if one person is the other 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 sometime clearly outdated or whether we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.720
 always for if I can do it always 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
 still relatively even in the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.149
 episodes number and so on 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.979
 and yes we are already 88 minute is there 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.829
 closed back after putting there 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.930
 on short counter and that's enough then 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.390
 I can not go through anymore 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.540
 your opponent half and that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.369
 meant for us then that we yes 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.950
 could not win anymore and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.840
 actually times out 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.009
 cup and now it sounds like that again 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.319
 phone 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.120
 and that's why I have to do it all now 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.739
 Throw away again so I hope so 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.720
 you will not become one anymore 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.610
 few contract renewals achieved and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.019
 a few were rejected that is called there 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.069
 we have to go back to a second round 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.590
 the negotiations 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.510
 and yes let's see if we can do it 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.239
 still our most difficult to tie 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.160
 because of course it is easier then in the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.930
 new season us a few players 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.340
 Quite a lot of players leave 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.660
 even leave and of course how 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.220
 possible somehow bind to me 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.349
 at least one more year so that I can 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.790
 Surely because we are apart 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.799
 that we are already relatively small 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.750
 squad now we have we are in now 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.670
 champaign trophy in the lead this time 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.299
 Every important thing goes on every port 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.430
 by rooney it would be nice that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.519
 we had tied a few players 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.069
 because yes, a small squad means first 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.780
 means great fitness problems 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.160
 but also that new players buy 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.120
 I have to have one 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.400
 few players I at least 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.310
 Ansatzweise know as lying completely 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.200
 to buy a new team together where 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.359
 I do not know if at all are good and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.100
 like at the party I know the relative 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.170
 are solid than any new buy 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.579
 how completely bad are 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.920
 Therefore, I still wanted a few of us 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.420
 tie yes in my eyes again 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.250
 can decide on free kick and then 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.040
 even on red white the last man was 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.690
 but well we did not do 10 like that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.480
 excited about it then was the next one 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.769
 chance there was still the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.600
 keeper turn therefore it gave way then 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.680
 The corner brought nothing but that was 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.810
 a great parade 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.819
 david lane unlocked and leaned 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.010
 alone against the keeper but also 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.780
 this time the keeper winner remains strong 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.970
 strong game in any case from him 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.670
 at 1 0 could do nothing after that 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.440
 really good at the alive alessandra and 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.230
 on the way to decision this time 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.780
 and this time he does not leave the keeper 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.880
 chance and we go in with 2 to 0 in 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.730
 leadership and of course have it now 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.139
 all of them held cards in hand 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.050
 winner to go from place 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.210
 shortly before the end of 2 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.340
 everything else meets classic 85 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.320
 minute meanwhile hw for 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.750
 alexandra and he gets another place 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.400
 has the chance to even increase to 3 0 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.010
 leave similar positions 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.320
 but this time he finally made it 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.120
 not our win anyway in the end two 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.280
 to zero 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.260
 Highly deserved victory no question and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.880
 so yes I do not like is a 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.680
 I had to check in as well as the team 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.570
 first in experience we see 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.640
 that will extend a few more and yet 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.510
 one again refuses with steering wheel and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920
 blue 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.200
 however, I believe that franzose 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 even 90,000 of the fa-cup get it 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.840
 Of course not the world but better 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.230
 now nothing 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.320
 but that means we're there 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.720
 out after fck benefits must be 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.280
 win if she leaves I do not know if 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.670
 we see how far we are because I can, 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.560
 would have to assess but yes flashes has 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.700
 as well as over probably will not 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560
 extend ours is already the third 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.540
 for times that he believes the contract 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.430
 unloads and I do not want that yet 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.900
 over pay then but rather go 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.660
 and we prefer to get one 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.000
 ordinary replacement in the summer though yes 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.410
 yes, anyway , we have to pass 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 we always go up hoping the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.560
 after all, the fl championsship league 1 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.300
 vfl champions league 1 there were sure and 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.450
 then into the fl championship would be then 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.950
 second English league so somehow 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.540
 we have to upgrade slowly 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.280
 Of course not the whole class yet 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.690
 The next league will not be too difficult 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.940
 are there directly to the rise 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.700
 also make a new arrival if we are 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.320
 Honestly, yes, we see the associations 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.580
 we are very very sovereign front 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.450
 two draws and two defeats 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.450
 are to be counted as a negative point 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.700
 Therefore, we have the first one 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.840
 chance in the game at toni makes yes with the 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.330
 easy does not go in and behind 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.550
 then missed some player from us 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.710
 I think it was one or alessandra 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.380
 or says yes we can do it unfortunately 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.790
 not 195 suspicious chance wrestle that 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.200
 is the second game of material against 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.550
 stoke has at least the post 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.210
 met before tried the keeper over 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.400
 to go 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.040
 but it does not succeed so not too 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.600
 happy city for him as well 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.729
 Every one of us has said so far 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.680
 Striker a very blatant 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.360
 down phase seyfried had emmi ten 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.169
 had not met games in a row 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.629
 Tomorrow, he will have that similar record 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.449
 actually only relatively 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:31.229
 rarely as we see here, yes , yes 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.150
 not again could not go on 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.610
 therefore , each of our players has so far 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.319
 such a phase and that's why I allow 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.059
 material to start directly away 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.189
 even this ball does not run 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:43.770
 pretty blatant what does not cleanse 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.960
 yes so material a 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.969
 not a thing better 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.050
 now in its rather unimportant phase 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:49.919
 where we are as good as 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.099
 have ascended 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.629
 as at some point if it shows importance shows 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.889
 then again his great shooting technique 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.899
 I did not think he was from there 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.199
 but goes in class firmly in the long 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.899
 corner 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.580
 to go to the blatant defensive errors because 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:05.009
 she still finds herself in sixth place 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.270
 minute came from the opposition I would have 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.339
 really not expected but great 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.710
 shooting technique and in the long corner 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.180
 the thing is then transformed 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.240
 the 1 0 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.099
 yes later the game was already 75 minute 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.830
 no easy game 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:22.580
 And that is already the final result 1 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.379
 0 at the end not much to say 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.419
 has the whole defensive relatively well in the 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.289
 grabbed and had luck that so unbelievable 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.279
 wasteful with his chances 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:34.529
 bypassed and that's enough in the end even 

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:36.120
 to victory or of course to the way and yes 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.589
 if she will finish in front 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.259
 friend shows me that, however, turned off 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:41.370
 the primus 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.139
 and yes, we do not mix with it 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.349
 video again i would say until then 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.349
