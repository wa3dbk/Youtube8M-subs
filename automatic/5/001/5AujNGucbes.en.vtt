protect<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.659> gears<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.259> steering

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
protect that the gears in your steering

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
protect that the gears in your steering
servo<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.610> turn<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> wheel<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
servo see as I turn the wheel just a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
servo see as I turn the wheel just a
little<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.310> give<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> little

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
little bit will actually give a little

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
little bit will actually give a little
bit<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.509> forth<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> protects<00:01:55.950> that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
bit back and forth so it protects that

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
bit back and forth so it protects that
steering<00:01:56.579> servo<00:01:57.030> while<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.899> there

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
steering servo while you're out there

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
steering servo while you're out there
getting<00:01:58.530> rough<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
getting rough with it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.750 
getting rough with it
alright<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.930> let's<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.230> ahead<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
alright now let's go ahead and take a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.050 
alright now let's go ahead and take a
look<00:02:03.110> at<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.310> pretty<00:02:05.610> cool

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
look at this one this one is pretty cool

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.840 
look at this one this one is pretty cool
now<00:02:06.510> basically<00:02:06.840> they're<00:02:07.229> both<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.310> same<00:02:08.340> on

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
now basically they're both the same on

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.590 
now basically they're both the same on
the<00:02:09.000> powertrain

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
the powertrain

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.190 
the powertrain
let<00:02:10.350> me<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.619> ahead<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:12.060> unplug<00:02:12.870> your

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
let me go ahead and just unplug your

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
let me go ahead and just unplug your
lights<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:13.980> push<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.700> body<00:02:14.880> back<00:02:15.120> out

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
lights I can push that the body back out

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.170 
lights I can push that the body back out
of<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.600> same<00:02:16.560> basic<00:02:16.980> setup<00:02:17.280> as<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
of the way same basic setup as the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.630 
of the way same basic setup as the
truggy<00:02:18.690> let's<00:02:19.650> take<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> look<00:02:20.100> at<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.400> side<00:02:20.610> by
