00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
hey guys this is Josh from

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.320 
hey guys this is Josh from
calm<00:00:10.920> bringing<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.400> review<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> nike

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
calm bringing in review for the nike

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.900 
calm bringing in review for the nike
blazer<00:00:12.570> elites<00:00:13.340> well<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.430> has<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.730> main

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
blazer elites well it has the main

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.460 
blazer elites well it has the main
question<00:00:15.090> between<00:00:15.510> for<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.260> shoe<00:00:16.439> is

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
question between for this shoe is

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.870 
question between for this shoe is
probably<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> what's<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.700> main<00:00:17.850> difference

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
probably the what's the main difference

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.910 
probably the what's the main difference
between<00:00:18.270> these<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.840> Malaysia<00:00:19.080> three<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
between these in Malaysia three and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700 
between these in Malaysia three and
really<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> only<00:00:20.369> difference<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:22.500> sole

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
really the only difference is the sole

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.429 
really the only difference is the sole
plate<00:00:22.970> which<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.570> standard<00:00:24.930> carbon<00:00:25.200> fiber

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
plate which is the standard carbon fiber

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
plate which is the standard carbon fiber
slope<00:00:25.770> at<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.009> same<00:00:26.220> exact<00:00:26.520> one<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.790> get<00:00:27.000> on

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
slope at the same exact one you get on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
slope at the same exact one you get on
the<00:00:27.210> Superfly<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.989> basically<00:00:28.680> Nike<00:00:29.040> have<00:00:29.130> put

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the Superfly and basically Nike have put

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.460 
the Superfly and basically Nike have put
this<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.700> all<00:00:30.029> their<00:00:30.270> elite<00:00:30.750> series<00:00:31.079> shoes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
this into all their elite series shoes

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.450 
this into all their elite series shoes
which<00:00:32.430> makes<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> lighter<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:34.460> not

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
which makes for a lighter and not

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.250 
which makes for a lighter and not
necessarily<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.059> better<00:00:36.329> shoe<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
necessarily a better shoe but in this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.870 
necessarily a better shoe but in this
case<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.920> say<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> does<00:00:38.430> make<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
case I would say it does make for a

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.120 
case I would say it does make for a
better<00:00:39.030> laser<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.750> basically<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> arbor

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
better laser I basically kind of arbor

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.490 
better laser I basically kind of arbor
slowly<00:00:41.430> provides<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.719> stiffness<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
slowly provides more stiffness and it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.079 
slowly provides more stiffness and it
eliminates<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> sub<00:00:44.460> pressure<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
eliminates all the sub pressure that you

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.779 
eliminates all the sub pressure that you
get<00:00:45.269> from<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.500> regular<00:00:46.649> soleplate<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get from the regular soleplate which I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
get from the regular soleplate which I
find<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.359> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> turns<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.679> soft

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
find is a little it turns it really soft

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
find is a little it turns it really soft
really<00:00:50.280> quickly<00:00:50.699> which<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.749> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> main

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really quickly which is one of the main

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.989 
really quickly which is one of the main
reasons<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.499> didn't<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
reasons I didn't really like it and the

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.849 
reasons I didn't really like it and the
other<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.179> you<00:00:54.269> get<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.050> soleplate

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
other thing you get this this soleplate

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.040 
other thing you get this this soleplate
is<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> stud<00:00:56.609> pattern<00:00:56.760> slightly<00:00:57.629> different

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is the stud pattern slightly different

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
is the stud pattern slightly different
than<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> Sandra<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.510> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> standard<00:01:00.960> one

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
than the Sandra one on the standard one

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049 
than the Sandra one on the standard one
you<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.440> found<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.159> all<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.730> studs<00:01:02.940> are

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you I found that all the studs are

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
you I found that all the studs are
exactly<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.569> same<00:01:03.600> length<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> back<00:01:05.309> ones

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
exactly the same length the back ones

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.360 
exactly the same length the back ones
and<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.730> front<00:01:05.940> ones<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.890> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> felt

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
and the front ones so it kind of felt

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.460 
and the front ones so it kind of felt
off<00:01:08.550> balance<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.300> one<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.600> they

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
off balance but this one they they

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
off balance but this one they they
shorten<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> front<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> made<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
shorten the front one so it made for a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
shorten the front one so it made for a
little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.020> better<00:01:13.170> traction<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.830> found<00:01:14.100> as

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
little bit better traction I found as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
little bit better traction I found as
for<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.570> upper<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.140> pretty<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.650> exactly

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for the upper it's pretty much exactly

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
for the upper it's pretty much exactly
the<00:01:17.310> same<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.300> out<00:01:18.510> of<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the same as you would get out of the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
the same as you would get out of the
synthetic<00:01:19.610> laser<00:01:20.610> threes<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> synthetic

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
synthetic laser threes the synthetic

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.360 
synthetic laser threes the synthetic
material<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.190> best

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
material it's it's not the best

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.500 
material it's it's not the best
synthetic<00:01:26.820> material<00:01:27.120> it's<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.360> bad

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
synthetic material it's not a bad

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.480 
synthetic material it's not a bad
synthetic<00:01:27.990> material<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.500> any<00:01:28.740> means<00:01:29.010> but<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
synthetic material by any means but I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
synthetic material by any means but I
would<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:31.470> kanga

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
would like to see them use their kanga

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
would like to see them use their kanga
light<00:01:32.040> material<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.730> they've<00:01:32.880> been<00:01:33.060> using

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
light material that they've been using

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.110 
light material that they've been using
all<00:01:33.480> those<00:01:33.840> shoes<00:01:34.580> which<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.880> we'll<00:01:36.000> see

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
all those shoes which I think we'll see

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.970 
all those shoes which I think we'll see
on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> new<00:01:36.480> lasers<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> be

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
on the new lasers that are going to be

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.070 
on the new lasers that are going to be
out<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.550> couple<00:01:38.610> months<00:01:39.060> probably<00:01:42.080> probably

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
out in a couple months probably probably

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.270 
out in a couple months probably probably
the<00:01:43.170> main<00:01:43.380> reason<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.890> get<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.130> lasers<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.730> the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the main reason to get the lasers is the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.000 
the main reason to get the lasers is the
the<00:01:47.280> instep<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:49.020> better

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
the instep which is all for better

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.400 
the instep which is all for better
fitting<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.550> shooting<00:01:51.000> her<00:01:51.320> basically<00:01:52.320> I

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
fitting you're shooting her basically I

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.800 
fitting you're shooting her basically I
wouldn't<00:01:52.770> say<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> makes<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:54.450> doesn't

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
wouldn't say that it makes it doesn't

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750 
wouldn't say that it makes it doesn't
give<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.140> power<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.500> anything<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.550> it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
give you more power or anything but it

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
overall this is a would I would say this

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.460 
overall this is a would I would say this
