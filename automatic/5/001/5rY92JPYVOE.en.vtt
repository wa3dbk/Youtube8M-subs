00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.270 

now<00:02:08.980> you<00:02:09.040> can<00:02:09.250> also<00:02:09.400> use

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
now you can also use

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.970 
now you can also use
you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.910> also<00:02:12.030> use<00:02:12.300> some<00:02:12.480> level<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:12.990> elements

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
you can also use some level one elements

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
you can also use some level one elements
too<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.550> hopefully<00:02:14.730> they'll<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.660> enemy<00:02:15.959> will

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
too and hopefully they'll the enemy will

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.070 
too and hopefully they'll the enemy will
cast<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:17.850> specifically<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.690> enemy

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
cast just specifically this enemy

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.750 
cast just specifically this enemy
hopefully<00:02:19.440> they'll<00:02:19.620> cast<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.100> back<00:02:20.130> at<00:02:20.490> you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
hopefully they'll cast it back at you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.600 
hopefully they'll cast it back at you
you<00:02:21.330> know<00:02:21.450> which<00:02:22.020> builds<00:02:22.860> up<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> grid<00:02:23.370> twice

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
you know which builds up the grid twice

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970 
you know which builds up the grid twice
as<00:02:23.819> fast<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.630> could<00:02:25.230> barely<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
as fast but I could barely get that to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:39.949 
as fast but I could barely get that to
work

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.229 

so<00:02:40.959> I'm<00:02:41.080> using<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.750> attack<00:02:43.750> number<00:02:44.110> one

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
so I'm using a the attack number one

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.940 
so I'm using a the attack number one
just<00:02:46.239> us<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> least<00:02:46.659> amount<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.049> damage<00:02:47.230> like

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
just us the least amount of damage like

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.080 
just us the least amount of damage like
I<00:02:48.099> said<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.580> building<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.680> yellow

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
I said just building up the yellow

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.369 
I said just building up the yellow
elemental<00:02:52.090> grid<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.250> Vipers<00:02:54.250> level<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:56.170> to

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
elemental grid and Vipers level up to

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.470 
elemental grid and Vipers level up to
eight<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:56.830> he<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.069> use<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.849> summon<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.269> got

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
eight so he can use the the summon I got

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:31.320 
eight so he can use the the summon I got
from<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> earth<00:02:59.049> dragon

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.900 

it<00:03:32.320> almost<00:03:32.650> there

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.310 

so<00:03:37.910> yeah<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.240> is<00:03:38.390> just<00:03:38.570> one<00:03:38.720> basic<00:03:38.960> way<00:03:39.290> of

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
so yeah this is just one basic way of

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.510 
so yeah this is just one basic way of
doing<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.800> there's<00:03:40.010> there's<00:03:40.310> other

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
doing it there's there's other

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.110 
doing it there's there's other
variations<00:03:41.270> like<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:41.720> might<00:03:41.900> go<00:03:42.050> faster<00:03:42.320> if<00:03:42.800> you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
variations like I might go faster if you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.290 
variations like I might go faster if you
fight<00:03:44.120> enemies<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:46.610> know<00:03:46.730> cast<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
fight enemies that you know cast the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.940 
fight enemies that you know cast the
type<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.510> element<00:03:47.660> you're<00:03:48.110> trying<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.530> to

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
type of element you're trying to to

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.690 
type of element you're trying to to
build<00:03:49.100> up<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.640> grid<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.460> one

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
build up on the grid but this this one

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.030 
build up on the grid but this this one
so<00:03:56.030> far<00:03:56.270> has<00:03:56.450> been<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.690> most<00:03:56.840> reliable<00:03:57.200> for<00:03:57.620> me

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:43.330 

there<00:04:06.040> we<00:04:06.160> go

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.090 

as<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.640> see<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.270> got<00:04:45.810> four<00:04:46.050> shiny<00:04:46.350> sands<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:46.980> it
