well<00:00:00.599> it's<00:00:00.750> time<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> put<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.469> concrete

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
well it's time to put the concrete

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.150 
well it's time to put the concrete
around<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:02.340> yard<00:00:02.550> hydrant<00:00:03.980> we're<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
around this yard hydrant we're going to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.290 
around this yard hydrant we're going to
use<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> 60<00:00:05.879> pound<00:00:06.120> bag<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.690> quikrete<00:00:07.500> concrete

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
use a 60 pound bag of quikrete concrete

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.759 
use a 60 pound bag of quikrete concrete
most<00:00:09.300> people<00:00:09.570> use<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.050> putting<00:00:10.170> post<00:00:10.500> in

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
most people use it for putting post in

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.690 
most people use it for putting post in
and<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.450> best<00:00:12.690> place<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.960> mix<00:00:13.559> concrete<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and the best place to mix concrete up is

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.320 
and the best place to mix concrete up is
a<00:00:14.730> wheelbarrow<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:16.410> hoe<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.029> mix<00:00:18.210> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
a wheelbarrow and a hoe you can mix it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.880 
a wheelbarrow and a hoe you can mix it
in<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> bucket<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> danger<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
in a bucket but you have a danger of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.160 
in a bucket but you have a danger of
getting<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.520> powder<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> bottom<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
getting a powder in the bottom of the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.009 
getting a powder in the bottom of the
bucket<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.480> normally<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
bucket so you would normally put a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.870 
bucket so you would normally put a
little<00:00:25.380> water<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> bottom<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> bucket

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
little water in the bottom of the bucket

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240 
little water in the bottom of the bucket
that<00:00:27.750> you're<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:28.949> put

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that you're going to use and then put

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
that you're going to use and then put
the<00:00:29.460> concrete<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> try<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> mix<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the concrete in and try to mix it up but

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.380 
the concrete in and try to mix it up but
it's<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.160> lot<00:00:32.309> easier<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> wheelbarrow<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it's a lot easier in the wheelbarrow and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.310 
it's a lot easier in the wheelbarrow and
that's<00:00:34.670> 60<00:00:35.670> pounds<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.450> takes<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.930> half<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's 60 pounds it takes a half a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.729 
that's 60 pounds it takes a half a
gallon<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> water<00:00:38.270> 128<00:00:39.270> ounces<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
gallon of water 128 ounces that's a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.450 
gallon of water 128 ounces that's a
liter<00:00:40.950> bottle<00:00:41.450> that's<00:00:42.450> 67<00:00:43.379> ounces<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.190> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
liter bottle that's 67 ounces I think so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
liter bottle that's 67 ounces I think so
that's<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> half<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.620> problem<00:00:47.039> with

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that's about a half and the problem with

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.569 
that's about a half and the problem with
concrete<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.289> bag<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> too

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
concrete I have one bag if I get it too

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
concrete I have one bag if I get it too
wet<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.660> trouble<00:00:51.870> I'd<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.920> get

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
wet I'm in trouble I'd have to go get

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.850 
wet I'm in trouble I'd have to go get
another<00:00:53.309> bag<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
another bag so you would put the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
another bag so you would put the
concrete<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.300> wheelbarrow<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
concrete in the wheelbarrow and you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.330 
concrete in the wheelbarrow and you
would<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.969> water<00:01:01.340> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
would not use all of that water you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
would not use all of that water you
would<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:02.910> use<00:01:02.940> down<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
would probably use down to about here to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.740 
would probably use down to about here to
start<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.430> add<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.210> until<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
start with and then add to it until you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
start with and then add to it until you
get<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.229> consistency

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
get the right consistency

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.359 
get the right consistency
and<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.420> consistency<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and the right consistency is when you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the right consistency is when you
can<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.150> hoe<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> Pat<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.920> top<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
can take this hoe and Pat the top and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.719 
can take this hoe and Pat the top and
get<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.479> liquid<00:01:16.250> smooth<00:01:17.250> liquid<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> top<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
get a liquid smooth liquid on the top so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.450 
get a liquid smooth liquid on the top so
anyway<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.570> box<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.830> bag<00:01:23.070> will

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
anyway this is a box that that bag will

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
anyway this is a box that that bag will
two<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> those<00:01:24.450> bags<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.680> square

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
two of those bags will do two square

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.840 
two of those bags will do two square
feet<00:01:26.340> 4<00:01:26.700> inch<00:01:26.909> slab<00:01:27.409> well<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
feet 4 inch slab well I'm going to do it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
feet 4 inch slab well I'm going to do it
with<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.030> bag<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> did<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.680> math<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
with one bag so I did a little math and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.600 
with one bag so I did a little math and
it's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.150> 16<00:01:33.600> foot<00:01:33.810> opening<00:01:34.290> 16<00:01:34.979> inch<00:01:35.189> opening

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's a 16 foot opening 16 inch opening

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.359 
it's a 16 foot opening 16 inch opening
and<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.020> give<00:01:37.170> me<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> 3<00:01:37.619> inch<00:01:37.770> slab<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and that will give me a 3 inch slab and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
and that will give me a 3 inch slab and
that's<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.939> 2x4<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> there's<00:01:41.729> 2<00:01:41.939> 19<00:01:42.720> inch

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that's a 2x4 and so there's 2 19 inch

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.039 
that's a 2x4 and so there's 2 19 inch
long<00:01:43.470> ones<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.070> 16s<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.240> equal<00:01:45.450> 16

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
long ones into 16s which will equal 16

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
long ones into 16s which will equal 16
inch<00:01:46.259> square<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
inch square then you have to get it in

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
inch square then you have to get it in
the<00:01:48.479> ground<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:50.340> little

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the ground and you see I have two little

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.490 
the ground and you see I have two little
garden<00:01:50.850> tools<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.509> level<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
garden tools to just level this out and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340 
garden tools to just level this out and
then<00:01:53.310> after<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.759> level<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
then after you level it as you get it in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.609 
then after you level it as you get it in
you<00:01:56.009> need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.670> soft<00:01:57.299> stuff<00:01:57.630> around<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you need to put soft stuff around the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.740 
you need to put soft stuff around the
edges<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> pack<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.450> concrete

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
edges and pack it down because concrete

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
edges and pack it down because concrete
would<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.290> under<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.939> weight<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
would go under it and the weight of the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.570 
would go under it and the weight of the
concrete<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:06.799> 64<00:02:07.799> pounds<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
concrete is going to be 64 pounds and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.520 
concrete is going to be 64 pounds and
then<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.720> would<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.229> around<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> sides

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
then you would put some around the sides

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.010 
then you would put some around the sides
you<00:02:12.680> were<00:02:12.800> tap<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.330> two-by-four

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
you were tap it in with the two-by-four

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.840 
you were tap it in with the two-by-four
so<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.740> isn't<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.220> anywhere<00:02:16.550> when

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
so that this isn't going anywhere when

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.699 
so that this isn't going anywhere when
you<00:02:16.970> put<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.300> concrete<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.260> none

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
you put that concrete on it and none

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.180 
you put that concrete on it and none
will<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.190> part<00:02:19.459> underneath<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.120> now<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.860> just

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
will we part underneath it now you just

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.530 
will we part underneath it now you just
mix<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.640> up<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.970> put<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:25.240> had<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.360> dig

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
mix it up and put it in I had to dig

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.090 
mix it up and put it in I had to dig
down<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.780> little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.920> can

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
down a little bit there because you can

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.160 
down a little bit there because you can
see<00:02:28.280> where<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> grade<00:02:28.819> level<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.140> use

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
see where the grade level is and I use

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.090 
see where the grade level is and I use
this<00:02:30.530> long<00:02:31.180> level<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.510> see<00:02:32.750> where<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.319> and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
this long level to see where it was and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.010 
this long level to see where it was and
it<00:02:34.430> will<00:02:34.550> take<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> little<00:02:35.180> bit<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.569> build<00:02:35.810> this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
it will take a little bit to build this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.990 
it will take a little bit to build this
up<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.709> always<00:02:36.950> had<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> little<00:02:37.640> trench

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
up and this always had a little trench

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.080 
up and this always had a little trench
around<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.569> but<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:40.100> bring<00:02:40.340> sole<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
around it but I can bring sole to this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.780 
around it but I can bring sole to this
and<00:02:41.390> square<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> soil<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and square it up with the soil and I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.850 
and square it up with the soil and I
plan<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.060> that's<00:02:44.600> all<00:02:44.840> treated<00:02:45.170> lumber<00:02:45.440> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
plan on that's all treated lumber and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.830 
plan on that's all treated lumber and
I'm<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> leave<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.120> box<00:02:47.510> after

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I'm going to leave it on the box after

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.009 
I'm going to leave it on the box after
it's<00:02:48.110> finished<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:50.470> easiest<00:02:51.470> way<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.800> dump<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
it's finished the easiest way to dump a

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.740 
it's finished the easiest way to dump a
concrete<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.380> your<00:02:54.620> wheelbarrow<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.790> have

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
concrete in your wheelbarrow is have

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.650 
concrete in your wheelbarrow is have
that<00:02:57.019> in<00:02:57.290> there<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.800> cut<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.880> open<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.480> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
that in there and cut that open and I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
that in there and cut that open and I
will<00:02:59.720> also<00:03:00.200> cut<00:03:00.410> down<00:03:00.440> each<00:03:00.800> side<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.700> when<00:03:01.880> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
will also cut down each side so when I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.170 
will also cut down each side so when I
lift<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.420> top<00:03:02.630> up<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.080> all<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.470> falls<00:03:03.739> out

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
lift the top up it all just falls out

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.320 
lift the top up it all just falls out
and<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.690> don't<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.290> lift<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:06.940> sixty<00:03:07.940> pounds

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and I don't have to lift up sixty pounds

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.979 
and I don't have to lift up sixty pounds
and<00:03:08.480> flip<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.870> over<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:11.480> that's<00:03:11.720> the

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
and flip it over and that's the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.530 
and flip it over and that's the
consistency<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.360> once<00:03:14.360> you've<00:03:14.510> used

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
consistency you have once you've used

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.900 
consistency you have once you've used
about<00:03:15.050> two-thirds<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.100> water<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.640> get

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
about two-thirds of the water so you get

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.720 
about two-thirds of the water so you get
a<00:03:19.940> good<00:03:20.299> blend<00:03:20.810> what<00:03:21.320> you're<00:03:21.500> after<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.640> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
a good blend what you're after and you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.050 
a good blend what you're after and you
got<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.030> dig<00:03:23.239> down<00:03:23.420> those<00:03:23.720> corners<00:03:24.730> now<00:03:25.730> put

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
got to dig down those corners now put

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.180 
got to dig down those corners now put
the<00:03:26.150> water<00:03:26.420> around<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.959> ears<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.590> go<00:03:27.980> down

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the water around the ears or go down

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.410 
the water around the ears or go down
underneath<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.480> see<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.940> lead<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:31.970> bottle

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
underneath it and see that lead a bottle

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.150 
underneath it and see that lead a bottle
I've<00:03:33.019> used<00:03:33.470> maybe<00:03:34.239> two-thirds<00:03:37.900> abused<00:03:38.900> almost

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
I've used maybe two-thirds abused almost

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.860 
I've used maybe two-thirds abused almost
liter<00:03:40.160> bottle<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:44.329> bottle<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.690> think

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
liter bottle and the bottle of think

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.490 
liter bottle and the bottle of think
there<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.940> see<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:47.480> not<00:03:47.630> wet<00:03:48.019> enough<00:03:48.049> to

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
there and see it's not wet enough to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.259 
there and see it's not wet enough to
even<00:03:48.620> bond<00:03:49.040> together<00:03:49.459> but<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:49.940> totally

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
even bond together but it's totally

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.069 
even bond together but it's totally
mixed<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.820> really<00:03:53.150> have<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> get<00:03:53.600> them<00:03:53.810> in

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
mixed and you really have to get them in

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.720 
mixed and you really have to get them in
the<00:03:54.170> bottom<00:03:54.530> make<00:03:54.829> sure<00:03:54.859> you're<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.370> leaving

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
the bottom make sure you're not leaving

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.990 
the bottom make sure you're not leaving
any<00:03:55.910> powder<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.489> going<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.760> take

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
any powder but it's going to take

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.569 
any powder but it's going to take
probably<00:03:59.570> more<00:03:59.959> water<00:04:00.230> than<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> half<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.310> gallon

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
probably more water than a half a gallon

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.090 
probably more water than a half a gallon
just<00:04:02.420> all<00:04:02.660> my<00:04:02.870> bottle<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.350> water<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.920> I've

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
just all my bottle of water and I've

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.520 
just all my bottle of water and I've
added<00:04:04.310> some<00:04:04.700> more<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> bottle<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.750> see

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
added some more to the bottle and see

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.870 
added some more to the bottle and see
when<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:06.859> do<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:08.090> don't<00:04:08.329> get<00:04:08.600> any<00:04:09.880> fluid

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
when you do this you don't get any fluid

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.720

degrees you might have to miss this so

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.140 
degrees you might have to miss this so
that<00:07:34.050> it<00:07:34.199> doesn't<00:07:34.650> dry<00:07:34.860> out<00:07:35.099> too<00:07:35.430> quick<00:07:35.759> on<00:07:35.789> the

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
that it doesn't dry out too quick on the

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.830 
that it doesn't dry out too quick on the
top<00:07:36.389> which<00:07:36.900> will<00:07:37.110> lead<00:07:37.349> to<00:07:37.379> cracking<00:07:38.840> another

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
top which will lead to cracking another

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.980 
top which will lead to cracking another
tip<00:07:40.199> we<00:07:40.860> had<00:07:41.009> concrete<00:07:41.430> in<00:07:41.699> this<00:07:41.879> thing<00:07:42.180> and<00:07:42.419> if

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990 
tip we had concrete in this thing and if

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.580 
tip we had concrete in this thing and if
you<00:07:43.110> just<00:07:43.289> hose<00:07:43.530> it<00:07:43.560> out<00:07:44.689> it<00:07:45.689> comes<00:07:45.750> off<00:07:46.139> really

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
you just hose it out it comes off really

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.010 
you just hose it out it comes off really
easy<00:07:46.830> it<00:07:47.550> holds<00:07:47.909> it<00:07:48.000> hose<00:07:48.270> it<00:07:48.449> off<00:07:48.539> your<00:07:48.780> tools

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
easy it holds it hose it off your tools

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.740 
easy it holds it hose it off your tools
it's<00:07:49.409> real<00:07:49.650> easy<00:07:49.770> if<00:07:50.310> you<00:07:50.430> let<00:07:50.639> it<00:07:50.789> dry<00:07:51.060> it's

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
it's real easy if you let it dry it's

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.379 
it's real easy if you let it dry it's
really<00:07:52.590> more<00:07:52.800> difficult<00:07:53.370> to<00:07:53.490> get<00:07:53.669> it<00:07:53.789> off<00:07:54.000> and

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389 
really more difficult to get it off and

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.580 
really more difficult to get it off and
I<00:07:55.259> mean<00:07:55.500> you<00:07:55.620> can<00:07:55.680> just<00:07:55.830> spray<00:07:56.190> this<00:07:56.370> hose<00:07:57.590> with

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.590 
I mean you can just spray this hose with

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.640 
I mean you can just spray this hose with
that<00:07:58.740> turned<00:07:59.009> up<00:07:59.250> on<00:07:59.430> its<00:07:59.610> in<00:07:59.819> and<00:08:00.289> 20<00:08:01.289> seconds

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.650 
that turned up on its in and 20 seconds

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.640 
that turned up on its in and 20 seconds
it's<00:08:01.830> clean<00:08:02.129> and<00:08:02.719> it's<00:08:03.719> alkaline<00:08:04.289> so<00:08:04.590> you

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.650 
it's clean and it's alkaline so you

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.680 
it's clean and it's alkaline so you
might<00:08:04.889> want<00:08:05.069> to<00:08:05.129> watch<00:08:05.340> where<00:08:05.699> you<00:08:05.879> do<00:08:06.180> it<00:08:06.210> in

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:06.690 
might want to watch where you do it in

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.510 
might want to watch where you do it in
case<00:08:07.050> you<00:08:07.080> have<00:08:07.379> plants<00:08:07.830> around<00:08:08.039> there's<00:08:08.370> it

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 
case you have plants around there's it

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.360 
case you have plants around there's it
like<00:08:08.669> acid<00:08:09.090> soil
