00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.899 
also get two cables and this is the coil
type<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> straight<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> both

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
type and this is the straight and both

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
type and this is the straight and both
of<00:01:57.060> them<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.420> supposed<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.200> about<00:01:58.530> three

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of them are supposed to be about three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.300 
of them are supposed to be about three
meters<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:01.110> other<00:02:01.290> headphones<00:02:01.649> it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
meters so your other headphones it's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.929 
meters so your other headphones it's
self<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.210> let<00:02:03.780> me<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.649> out

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.270 

and<00:02:07.929> they're<00:02:08.140> actually<00:02:08.289> not<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:09.060> heavy<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
and they're actually not that heavy and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.080 
and they're actually not that heavy and
again<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> build<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:12.940> entirely<00:02:13.360> plastic<00:02:13.959> so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
again the build is entirely plastic so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.570 
again the build is entirely plastic so
it's<00:02:16.560> basically<00:02:17.560> plastic<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.280> would<00:02:18.459> say

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
it's basically plastic I would say

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.240 
it's basically plastic I would say
plastic<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.180> nothing<00:02:19.720> metallic<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:21.040> here

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
plastic but nothing metallic the here

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.430 
plastic but nothing metallic the here
cups<00:02:21.519> feel<00:02:21.819> very<00:02:22.360> soft<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:22.959> they<00:02:23.110> should<00:02:23.319> be

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
cups feel very soft so they should be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.400 
cups feel very soft so they should be
very<00:02:23.470> comfortable<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.700> wear<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.230> thing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
very comfortable to wear and the thing

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.320 
very comfortable to wear and the thing
with<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.739> M<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.580> M<00:02:27.930> 40<00:02:28.930> X<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.349> n<00:02:29.470> 50<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.010> that

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
with the M this M 40 X and n 50 is that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.559 
with the M this M 40 X and n 50 is that
these<00:02:31.330> can<00:02:31.599> rotate<00:02:31.780> only<00:02:32.049> till<00:02:32.379> like<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.569> not

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
these can rotate only till like this not

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.949 
these can rotate only till like this not
completely<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.410> M<00:02:35.560> 50<00:02:36.069> s<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.760> move<00:02:37.000> also<00:02:37.660> in

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
completely the M 50 s can move also in

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.780 
completely the M 50 s can move also in
this<00:02:38.140> other<00:02:38.349> direction<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.340> only<00:02:39.489> move

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this other direction this can only move

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.400 
this other direction this can only move
in<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.329> direction<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.910> says<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.720> th

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
in this direction and it just says a th

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.960 
in this direction and it just says a th
M<00:02:44.650> 40<00:02:45.160> X<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.019> also<00:02:47.410> plastics<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
M 40 X again this is also plastics and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.330 
M 40 X again this is also plastics and
we<00:02:49.390> have<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> audio-technica<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.829> we<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
we have the audio-technica and we have a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.960 
we have the audio-technica and we have a
soft<00:02:51.760> rubber<00:02:52.030> padding<00:02:52.540> over<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.190> these

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
soft rubber padding over here and these

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.569 
soft rubber padding over here and these
are<00:02:55.120> 40mm<00:02:55.690> drivers<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.379> we<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
are 40mm drivers that we have and I

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.400 
are 40mm drivers that we have and I
believe<00:02:58.680> impedance<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.829> 35<00:03:00.459> ohms<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
believe impedance is 35 ohms and the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
believe impedance is 35 ohms and the
thing<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.040> M<00:03:03.310> 40<00:03:03.790> X<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.120> n<00:03:04.209> 50<00:03:04.629> X<00:03:04.780> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
thing with this M 40 X and n 50 X is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.530 
thing with this M 40 X and n 50 X is
that<00:03:05.049> we<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.349> detachable<00:03:05.859> cables<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.579> this

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that we have detachable cables and this

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.809 
that we have detachable cables and this
is<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> main<00:03:08.049> cable<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> coil<00:03:09.519> type

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
is the main cable this is the coil type

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.569 
is the main cable this is the coil type
and<00:03:10.120> we<00:03:10.629> also<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.500> add<00:03:11.739> up<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
and we also have this add up this you

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.819 
and we also have this add up this you
can<00:03:12.790> remove<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.269> if<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.139> AM<00:03:14.410> sex

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
mp3 players and as you can see this will

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.349 
mp3 players and as you can see this will
go<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:26.019> here<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.709> plug<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.819> this<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.329> a

go in here and plug in and this is a
proprietary<00:03:28.720> cable<00:03:29.169> so<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.799> just<00:03:30.220> can't<00:03:30.430> use

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
proprietary cable so you just can't use

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.370 
proprietary cable so you just can't use
anything<00:03:30.880> else<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.419> now<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.930> locked<00:03:32.230> and

anything else and now it's locked and
ready<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:33.069> use<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.819> will<00:03:33.970> test<00:03:34.150> out<00:03:34.329> these

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
ready to use so I will test out these

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.289 
ready to use so I will test out these
