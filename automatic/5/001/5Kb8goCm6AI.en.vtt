always hear something out for is it a
different<00:03:06.980> sound<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.549> if<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.690> look<00:03:08.840> for<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
different sound and if you look for the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.559 
different sound and if you look for the
hole<00:03:09.319> obviously<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.430> finger<00:03:10.819> texture<00:03:11.299> and

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
hole obviously a finger texture and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.510 

so<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.710> what<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.920> looks<00:03:31.980> like

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
so that's what it looks like

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.460 
so that's what it looks like
turning<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.910> pineapple<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.900> ice<00:03:34.050> around
