it looks like on my finger and then I

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.650 
it looks like on my finger and then I
decided<00:00:43.219> from<00:00:43.429> other<00:00:43.670> trials<00:00:43.999> and<00:00:44.149> errors<00:00:44.269> so

decided from other trials and errors so
where<00:00:45.050> my<00:00:45.140> camera<00:00:45.350> would<00:00:45.559> shut<00:00:45.800> off<00:00:45.949> on<00:00:46.190> me

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
where my camera would shut off on me

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.270 
where my camera would shut off on me
that<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:47.239> going<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.749> try<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.170> out<00:00:48.379> on<00:00:48.769> my<00:00:48.949> wrist

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
that I'm going to try it out on my wrist

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.270 
that I'm going to try it out on my wrist
but<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.820> that's<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.210> best<00:00:50.749> area<00:00:51.260> for<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.129> to

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
but and that's the best area for you to

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.799 
but and that's the best area for you to
be<00:00:52.399> able<00:00:52.609> to<00:00:52.730> see<00:00:52.999> it<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:53.659> how

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
be able to see it and this is just how

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.569 
be able to see it and this is just how
it<00:00:53.929> looks<00:00:53.960> like<00:00:54.260> on<00:00:54.469> my<00:00:54.530> skin<00:00:55.100> without<00:00:55.429> me

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
it looks like on my skin without me

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.520

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
blending it in and this to me is kind of

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.610 
blending it in and this to me is kind of
like<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.739> peach<00:01:04.210> color<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.990> pink

like a peach color it's pink
it's<00:01:07.520> more<00:01:07.880> pink<00:01:08.330> than<00:01:09.260> red<00:01:09.650> but<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.730> does<00:01:10.850> have

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's more pink than red but it does have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's more pink than red but it does have
a<00:01:11.090> slight<00:01:11.660> yellow<00:01:12.110> undertone<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:13.460> me

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
a slight yellow undertone to it to me

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.870 
a slight yellow undertone to it to me
and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.870> personally<00:01:15.380> like<00:01:15.650> it<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.010> works<00:01:16.220> great

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
and I personally like it and works great

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.540 
and I personally like it and works great
for<00:01:16.910> me<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.450> not<00:01:17.600> showing<00:01:17.960> up<00:01:18.430> exciting<00:01:19.430> its

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
for me it's not showing up exciting its

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.000 
for me it's not showing up exciting its
greatest<00:01:19.820> potential<00:01:20.270> because<00:01:20.900> I'm<00:01:21.680> doing<00:01:21.860> it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
greatest potential because I'm doing it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.740 
greatest potential because I'm doing it
on<00:01:22.130> my<00:01:22.220> wrist<00:01:22.460> versus<00:01:22.940> my<00:01:23.090> hand<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.570> on<00:01:23.660> my
