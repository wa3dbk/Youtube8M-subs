00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey guys next up we have our new LG one

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys next up we have our new LG one
platform<00:00:03.870> pedals<00:00:04.430> these<00:00:05.430> things<00:00:05.790> were<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> long

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
platform pedals these things were a long

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.600 
platform pedals these things were a long
time<00:00:06.270> coming<00:00:06.540> from<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.319> from<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> old<00:00:08.309> Dave

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
time coming from that from the old Dave

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.030 
time coming from that from the old Dave
Wiegel<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.090> 13<00:00:09.510> days<00:00:09.809> when<00:00:10.530> they<00:00:10.679> are<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
Wiegel you 13 days when they are the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.450 
Wiegel you 13 days when they are the
prototypes<00:00:11.370> were<00:00:11.849> called<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> staccato<00:00:13.460> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
prototypes were called the staccato so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
prototypes were called the staccato so
now<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.969> two<00:00:15.150> versions<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> these<00:00:16.199> pedals

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
now we have two versions of these pedals

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.120 
now we have two versions of these pedals
we<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.580> LG<00:00:17.789> 1<00:00:18.240> plus<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.500> LG<00:00:19.920> one

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
we have the LG 1 plus and the LG one

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
we have the LG 1 plus and the LG one
race<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> main<00:00:21.689> difference<00:00:22.199> between

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
race so the main difference between

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.189 
race so the main difference between
these<00:00:22.769> two<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> LG<00:00:24.330> One<00:00:24.510> race<00:00:24.750> uses

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
these two is that the LG One race uses

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.189 
these two is that the LG One race uses
titanium<00:00:25.890> pins<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.490> spindle<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> LG<00:00:28.050> 1

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
titanium pins and spindle and the LG 1

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.429 
titanium pins and spindle and the LG 1
plus<00:00:28.529> uses<00:00:28.980> steel<00:00:29.400> spins<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> steel<00:00:30.840> pins<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
lightweight a couple of really unique

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.619 
lightweight a couple of really unique
features<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.090> these<00:00:45.210> pedals

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
features that we have on these pedals

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.080 
features that we have on these pedals
number<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.770> we're<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.370> polycarbonate

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
number one we're using a polycarbonate

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
number one we're using a polycarbonate
wear<00:00:48.450> plate<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.170> attaches<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
wear plate that attaches to the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
wear plate that attaches to the
mainframe<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> pedal<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.989> web<00:00:52.230> plate

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
mainframe of the pedal this web plate

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
mainframe of the pedal this web plate
does<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:52.949> things<00:00:53.210> first<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.559> absorbs

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
does two things first of all it absorbs

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
does two things first of all it absorbs
impact<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> disperses<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> energy<00:00:58.739> more

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
impact and disperses that energy more

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
impact and disperses that energy more
efficiently<00:00:59.010> than<00:00:59.550> aluminum<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.660> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
efficiently than aluminum would so it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
efficiently than aluminum would so it's
the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.379> material<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.699> use

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the same material that we actually use

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
the same material that we actually use
on<00:01:03.059> our<00:01:03.149> bosch<00:01:03.390> guards<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.680> next<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
on our bosch guards the next thing that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
on our bosch guards the next thing that
it<00:01:05.460> does<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it does is if you look at that the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
it does is if you look at that the
outside<00:01:08.070> edge<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> pedal<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
outside edge of the pedal this is a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
outside edge of the pedal this is a
location<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.439> sees<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> rock<00:01:11.430> hits

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
location that sees a lot of rock hits

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.440 
location that sees a lot of rock hits
and<00:01:11.909> impacts<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> damage<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and impacts and a lot of damage so this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
and impacts and a lot of damage so this
outside<00:01:15.960> edge<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.890> extra<00:01:17.130> lip<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
outside edge we have an extra lip on the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
outside edge we have an extra lip on the
polycarbonate<00:01:18.479> hear<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
polycarbonate hear what the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.469 
polycarbonate hear what the
polycarbonate<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> instead<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
polycarbonate does is instead of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
polycarbonate does is instead of
catching<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> rocks<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.979> aluminum<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
catching on rocks like aluminum would it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
catching on rocks like aluminum would it
actually<00:01:24.420> slides<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:25.350> rocks<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:26.009> easier<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
actually slides off rocks much easier so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
actually slides off rocks much easier so
it<00:01:27.689> helps<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> maintain<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.530> speed<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.950> bit

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it helps you maintain your speed a bit

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.710 
it helps you maintain your speed a bit
more<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.700> coming<00:01:30.060> through<00:01:30.090> sections

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
more when you're coming through sections

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
more when you're coming through sections
where<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.020> hitting<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.409> pedals<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
where you're hitting your pedals the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.570 
where you're hitting your pedals the
outside<00:01:32.400> edge<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:32.850> pedals<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.450> rocks

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
outside edge of your pedals on rocks

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.730 
outside edge of your pedals on rocks
these<00:01:36.210> web<00:01:36.510> plates<00:01:36.870> are<00:01:37.200> actually

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
these web plates are actually

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.150 
these web plates are actually
replaceable<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> damage<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.290> you
