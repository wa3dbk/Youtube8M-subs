00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 remember that cool roles when someone 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.980
 checked just opened the lid 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.109
 laptops 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 This video was called a test on macbook 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.160
 because macbook and if you take for 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 upper half of the body with a finger she 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.549
 easy to open in abstract 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 the laptop he rolls over along with 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.420
 bottom part because the hinge is too 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.730
 tight or because it is too heavy 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 or for a thousand other reasons in general 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.199
 I am now at computex 2015 and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 there are a lot of new laptops here and we 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.750
 check if they pass tests 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750
 macbook 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.800
 here it is 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190
 So 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 don't pass 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 So 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.360
 don't need to be too tight this is a full file 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:42.479
 too tight too easy too 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.479
 light bottom asus to series 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.890
 all good 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.890
 all all blog 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.290
 Well 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.979
 halftone goods so much 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.979
 and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.979
 need to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.520
 It was full 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.739
 us 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.459
 further a little general we are here right away 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.459
 clear to all 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.540
 you can even pick up 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.730
 in general, everything 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 pretty light on so at the end starts 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.450
 climb a little 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.450
 yes fine 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.810
 this is some kind of new gaming laptop and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.520
 by weight 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.640
 about 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.640
 she is 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.180
 the best are the best for now 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.280
 will try 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.680
 here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.340
 but almost 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.120
 nearly 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 here is no 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:17.560
 No, and too weak very-very bad 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.560
 very bad 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.150
 and already something is clear best 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.550
 open gaming laptops skin just 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.050
 open up in transformers but it 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.610
 understandable in gaming laptops very 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.770
 heavy base so the screen 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.180
 leans back very simple transformers 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.560
 all the way around they have a heavy lid 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.690
 so the keyboard is natural 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.120
 rises with him obviously here 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.590
 what's that in average laptops 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.570
 manufacturers do not pay at all 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.480
 attention to how tight loops 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.700
 how much do the balance of balance top 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.200
 half body and bottom in general all 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 bad and i advise manufacturers 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.410
 think about it because it is very 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.070
 important for everyday use 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.070
 laptop
