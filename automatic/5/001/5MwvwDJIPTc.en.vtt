00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.409
 Upper Austria to taste TV 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.150
 in obstetrics hardly a topic is discussed as hotly as the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.940
 Cesarean section on the one hand, of course he is one 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.160
 because of the modern medicine prepared for a caesarean section is done there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.749
 In the past, women and children simply died 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.879
 and on the other hand, it is so the so-called section in recent years 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.890
 is increasingly common and that many women as the caesarean 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 They mix and engage in the natural birth process 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.710
 I would like to talk to my guest today about the caesarean section 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.440
 Yachts Neuerburg Ciccone intended 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 answering my questions have been in obstetrics for more than 80 years 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.950
 Lukas Meier before birth is already done around there, too 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
 often advised to caesarean section in which cases is it so 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.680
 a few so-called medical indications that even before birth 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 the need for a caesarean section that makes it clear that percentages are 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 the center premium so lying in front of the cervix the center which too 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 Bleeding would result if it came to normal birth 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 these include the childish malformations 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 this includes the percent so-called relative mismatch that is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 Percent WW 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.130
 is already from the outset a too large percent leads the BAK of the mother 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.110
 and of course 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.560
 this includes certain around 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 The Center Disorders so supply disturbance to the Mother Cake Spa 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 this, in the interest of the child, necessitate a cesarean section of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.130
 perform in advance 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.909
 Although there are also reasons for Zambezi's birth yesterday 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.240
 Birth percent can come to that for Uli Zico's situation for the baby 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.310
 the supply 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.409
 under childbirth is not as guaranteed as it should be 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.640
 This is what one sees in so-called midwives heart sounds of the child 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.230
 then shrubs 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.140
 the so-called Kalashnikov and agile or per second 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 even though the birth comes to a halt without the cervix 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.279
 is incompletely opened 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.779
 and then you had to bring the child around mountain so game to the world 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.459
 what the questions actually agree with 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.379
 yes, the absolute prerequisite for the goal in mind 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.479
 Ten caesarean section to stand that has so far never experienced up to 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.639
 a single time 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.009
 that the woman did not agree to a necessary cadre cut in 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.249
 In this case, it was a schizophrenic patient whom we then 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.139
 but after 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.039
 to talk in the seven but could convince the caesarean section 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.949
 to have carried out 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.369
 What is a single digit of this gentle cesarean section 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.999
 the whole piece plays with oldie from Israel in Germany 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.469
 was introduced to Mister flat roof 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:53.779
 to take into account more the layers of the body and that will be stages without 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.069
 Minden use of sheer or knife movie history 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.429
 Stories apart per cent separated 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:08.719
 and thereby 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.719
 To cure spots it with less pain 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.370
 Brake to the birth before the birth of January after ivory and after 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.979
 of birth 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.539
 What is the woman physically different than appointment after 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:21.580
 a spontaneous birth 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.239
 into the samples 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.090
 Pain is perhaps a bit longer after Col d'aspin 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.799
 Lasting as after a company offer whereby naturally also the ladies plays 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.959
 which is used less and less frequently in modern times 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.749
 can also cause a few days opened up so the woman is after one 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:38.889
 Caesarean section 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.659
 it's certainly a little less mobile for him to paint a corner to the gate 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.509
 childbirth 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.589
 It can cause bleeding complications it may cause infection now 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.649
 Thrombosis and embolism 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.399
 and he now like him 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:56.229
 however, the premiums Karl Schmidt could still be significantly risky 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.629
 as a normal birth 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.439
 Gibbs also determines investigations 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.099
 learning how the Christ child is there 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.629
 yes there is also implemented wants more adjustment disorder of the child after one 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.819
 Caesarean section 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.499
 for example, they are only felt by the child with percent fruit of water 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.109
 and around the birth with this book water from the lungs and more or 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.609
 less pronounced either way expelled from the child 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.009
 so children after a change paint birth very much fitter very much 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.659
 are more alert than after a cesarean section 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.849
 and it can also after Caesarean sections 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.789
 to hear every now and then 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.449
 Mappus errors then come a temporary maintenance of the child 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.370
 require 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.430
 I know that when I read in our forum or 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.870
 I also talked to children who had cesarean section and the countries 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.750
 So remember, I never have a problem with that anymore 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.800
 spontaneously gave birth to what is the experience of the majority of the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.759
 Tenant expects percent 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.879
 to uncomplicated after an uncomplicated pregnancy 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:55.590
 birth 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.860
 and she is proud of her child 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.569
 to be able to give birth to oneself 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.050
 that is indeed, although it creates no disease and birth should be something quite 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.500
 be many logical 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.330
 and if that was not so much logical then and 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.950
 the help of the doctors has taken then one is 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.029
 disappointed 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.869
 Unfortunately, this desire for Hainer is normal natural childbirth 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:20.770
 also a little off in the population 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.580
 because that is also the desire cadre cut rate 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.800
 with 5 percent but significantly beats 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.349
 as restrained "It's inviting again, but I have one more question 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.570
 serious cesarean section 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.530
 It may happen already is its last part of the harvest years 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.530
 Actually, there are other Noreau examination percentages out there as well 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.080
 it was called 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.680
 around clinic LÃ¼beck 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.010
 which shows that in their posts this in Boston pulls the roughs aged 07 30 the 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.880
 Caesarean rate at 3 percent and today at 30 percent seven is Sara 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.110
 Foster in ten-fold increase in caesarean section in Germany 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.009
 Percent is the caesarean rate from 19 97 17 percent to 2730 percent 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.570
 soaring and that I already quite clearly increase the so 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.289
 is that, of course, in connection with the child no 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.439
 Take risks, therefore, so-called forensic reasons for the 8 Kazan 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.090
 Stiegler had led otherwise he can get a legal problem 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.569
 Leon especially the child to put lives in danger 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.180
 and in addition 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.300
 But you do not have to counter that the percentages 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:30.359
 Modern Cases no longer mean so highly traumatic and dangerous for the 

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:33.809
 Middle are as is and many years ago, for example, the 30-year-old
