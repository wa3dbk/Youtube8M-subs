00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.970
 display sponsor merchant elf shop 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.240
 a lot of cool stuff on dota 2 including 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.430
 I recommend plush freon 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.769
 hello gangsters panda with you i think that 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.170
 many of you love to play mode 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.830
 one-on-one solomid and already noticed something 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.750
 it's been two or three weeks 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.990
 different guys probably will not be the most 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.840
 high IQ abuses 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.609
 Abuzzy games lounger cut down 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 certain trees are getting under 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.210
 the tower will start this tower 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.680
 cut we will not discuss how it 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
 done because many have it already 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 my channels showed yes and I think that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.720
 it is not very correct because it 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.549
 really breaking the rules of the game 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.640
 because if straw is breaking anything 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.470
 side taver but nevertheless we 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.479
 let's see how to deal with such buffers 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.909
 In this case, I play the big general 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.290
 Iâ€™ve gotten pretty good 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.119
 go fast on cancer 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.129
 penny is not enough to kill it 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.739
 stinky buzzer and right there I'll go buy 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.390
 myself etc. first rule if you are 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.680
 play against leshrak and you have 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 suspicion that he will go now 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.390
 break side tiger buy immediately thq 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.460
 spend money but not kill you these there 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.950
 one hundred thirty five gold let her 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.350
 will be pocket. allow you when 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.780
 arshaka 1 1 or 2 1 or once again 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.659
 here's how this small piece will go the second time 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.429
 along the same track the chain will allow 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.979
 you quickly fly thus breaking 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.899
 the cunning little deer's plan is not 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.460
 forget so if you will have 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.380
 tangi in your pocket and cut down a couple of trees 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.999
 He avers that this will start another deer peck 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.070
 that's how I see right now there are trees 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.780
 the deer cut out as a result receives from 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 tavera and and which was still at the first 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.799
 attempt this as a boozer in this way 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.780
 nothing works and line mid already 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.909
 okay miss because when he 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.490
 starts to leave to break the side 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.310
 taver i'm calm i start to push mid and when 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.630
 the first opportunity the Jesuit like 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.939
 that is, in principle, leshrak win 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.130
 can be any hero important control 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.509
 map look at the side taverns if u 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.969
 you turn on the sound then it is easier to boom 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.280
 they say that here under and so it 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.380
 hear lead defend buy this pawn 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.479
 buy yourself tangi 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.709
 and there is nothing difficult even considering 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.040
 man breaks the rules you all but 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.090
 you can win well how am I in this case 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.709
 Well, in general, if you are not very good 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.569
 It turns out to play in this mode, try 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.080
 servants of heroes for example grow or 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.260
 great 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.910
 quite interesting are the battles and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.360
 funny wins thanks for watching not 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.360
