00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.408
What are you doing?

00:00:16.408 --> 00:00:19.000
You are interrupting and we are working... What's up?

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.688
Sorry, I wanted to see what's there..

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:24.163
Can I know what's there?

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:24.840
Oh...

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:26.226
Humm...

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:27.913
You won't say anything, shushh. Alright?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.691
Yes...

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:29.570
Alright? Wait...

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:32.194
C'mon...

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.460
Shushh...

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.691
Oh! Wow!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.940
What's inside, what's it?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.800
What's it?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.080
We're working...

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.272
...because soon we'll show to the whole world...

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:04.773
...the First Argentinian Deaf Film Festival.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.875
Cool! 

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.318
Is there a name sign for this Festival?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.314
Yes.

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:11.794
Watch, let's practice it...

00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:19.388
Oh! Of course...

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.377
Yes, and oh I'm left handed.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.280
Congratulations!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.420
Is this right?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.940
Good.

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:29.439
Thanks.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.367
I hope you'll come and see this festival.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.802
Yes...

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.970
And let everybody know...

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.473
...to your friends, your contacts, to the deaf community...

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:40.642
...and to everybody.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.269
Oh, can I let the hearing people know?

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.021
Yes! To they too!

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.002
In all reality, this festival's objective is...

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.442
...that the Deaf Community be seen... 

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:50.729
...our culture...

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:52.404
...our identity...

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.617
 ...And this way, breaking down with the evident passivity...

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:55.990
Of course, to mobilize, to encourage...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.867
Yes! to show off our development.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.387
Alright. Thanks!

00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:00.912
Bye!!

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.077
Good Bye!

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.460
Coming Soon.
