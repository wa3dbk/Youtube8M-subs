00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 to lend my voice 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 Although this time it's about the movie it is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.650
 a disney channel movie and art 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.200
 practically around the children of the bad guys 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.430
 and, for example, the children of manager 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.400
 cent or source wants and so on 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.190
 Come to the school before 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.330
 because of the good children and it is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.010
 a very clever idea and I am happy 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.110
 I have huge again the chance 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.520
 So we are allowed to speak to one another 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 love from 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 the whole team and the iconic studio 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.050
 at courts on the way into 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.210
 Recording Studio I am now a shelf 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.620
 mega nervous say pretty excited 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.350
 let me also makes vehicles is 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.360
 my nose because i'm still good when 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.700
 the nose already all day long and 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.530
 I do not know how I took the pictures 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.440
 should do without breaking nasal 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 let's see how I get the first 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.370
 is the screening on the work plan 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.580
 and then go immediately to the tasks 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.580
 4 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.090
 before you start talking it is 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.420
 By the way, so you have a countdown 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.370
 before you get started with his text 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.760
 gmx was it for example so you two 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.950
 strokes have come on one and 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.660
 as soon as they have touched you 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.820
 speak a text and here now 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.970
 so the counter and gives in the form of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.040
 pay and then when the numbers 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.040
 have expired at the 33 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.200
 and finally it's time we report 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.349
 live from the grand event of the year prince 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 bands have coronation festivities now 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.810
 you yourself pure for a bit 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.299
 sneaked that was not so nice his 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.159
 recording the better is finally it 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.599
 as far as we report live from 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.120
 major event of the year 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.440
 we need another one at last 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
 one that so far has the boarding 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.560
 little enthusiastic of his do you think 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.510
 that announces all that I want 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.900
 a little bit more time and still stresses 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.790
 keep running until she is more and more finite 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 as far as we report live from 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.579
 major event of the year plan 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.810
 coronation celebrations super wonderful 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:04.970
 very nice thank you to be the balls 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:19.519
 romanian street child the elections 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:20.510
 Romania on the street but you think 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.160
 that one with the cork 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.980
 For example, if you have a text days 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.169
 difficult to speak then in so 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.199
 a normal cork and speak 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.540
 the text with the cards then you will 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:36.849
 that is why we see much more clearly 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.849
 Ball speaks well articulated 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.910
 wittingly , then exactly that is 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.680
 place where they always followed so 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.359
 where they have not come over this 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.109
 then you can usually immediately 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.109
 much better 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.049
 really once a week or every day 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.519
 Five minutes always another place 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.109
 will always be louder will also like 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.940
 speak lazy speak I have to 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.340
 but now only actor coaches 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.959
 specialized in acting 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.890
 it is also because there are only googles 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.510
 also spokesman 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.040
 there are also people who are then 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.890
 Of course breathing technique is a very important one 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.770
 cause that you are just like so if you 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.510
 Of course, in the beginning a lot 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.970
 breathlessly read then you often back on 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:32.480
 Do not breathe that you let me go 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:35.060
 War sounds like I'm back in the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.210

 of which is first third job 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.100

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.220
