up<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> back<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.710> sorry<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.430> front<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
up on the back I'm sorry in the front of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
up on the back I'm sorry in the front of
the<00:01:56.729> microphone<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:57.870> it<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.409> see

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the microphone or use it so you can see

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
the microphone or use it so you can see
they're<00:01:58.650> just<00:01:58.680> three<00:01:59.430> different<00:01:59.520> modes

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
they're just three different modes

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
they're just three different modes
there's<00:02:00.570> guns<00:02:01.170> oome<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.340> gun<00:02:02.520> okay<00:02:03.920> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there's guns oome off and gun okay so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.710 
there's guns oome off and gun okay so
that's<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.310> works<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
that's how that works here now this is

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.900 
that's how that works here now this is
uh<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.440> works<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.070> your<00:02:08.190> active<00:02:08.549> interface

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
uh this works with your active interface

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
uh this works with your active interface
shoe<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.540> Sony<00:02:10.200> camcorders<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> utilize

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
shoe on Sony camcorders that utilize

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.350 
shoe on Sony camcorders that utilize
that<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.880> can<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.030> here<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.330> my

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that so as you can see here I have my

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.020 
that so as you can see here I have my
Sony<00:02:12.630> camcorder<00:02:13.190> slide<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.370> little<00:02:14.700> door

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
Sony camcorder slide that little door

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.210 
Sony camcorder slide that little door
open<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.560> basically<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.799> does<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
open and basically what this does is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.830 
open and basically what this does is
this<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.610> active<00:02:17.940> shoot<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.690> will

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this this active shoot here it will

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
this this active shoot here it will
power<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.350> device<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.610> will<00:02:20.700> allow<00:02:20.880> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
power the device and it will allow you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.420 
power the device and it will allow you
to<00:02:21.090> connect<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> device<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> them<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
and then you slide it forward and then

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620 
and then you slide it forward and then
you<00:02:40.410> rotate<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.920> ring<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:42.150> locked<00:02:42.450> into

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
you rotate the ring it's locked into

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.440 
you rotate the ring it's locked into
place<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.440> now<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.739> nice<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.120> tight<00:02:45.329> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
place so now it's nice and that tight on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.979 
place so now it's nice and that tight on
there<00:02:45.630> okay<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:48.329> even<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there okay as you can see it even it's a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.420 
there okay as you can see it even it's a
little<00:02:49.170> bit<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> shock<00:02:49.739> arm<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.310> you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
little bit like a shock arm like if you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430 
little bit like a shock arm like if you
is<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.850> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.150> play<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.540> there<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.349> that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
is a little bit play in there so that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.780 
is a little bit play in there so that
when<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:52.770> bumping<00:02:53.040> into<00:02:53.190> stuff<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:53.670> it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
when you're bumping into stuff or it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.360 
when you're bumping into stuff or it
will<00:02:53.940> pick<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.150> any<00:02:54.300> audio<00:02:54.660> off

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
will pick up any audio off

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.890 
will pick up any audio off
off<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.940> number<00:02:56.239> if<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.569> had<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
off of that number if you had a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.180 
off of that number if you had a
camcorder<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.590> has<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.830> maybe<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.069> hard

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
camcorder that has it maybe the hard

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.680 
camcorder that has it maybe the hard
drive<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:59.000> makes<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.209> little<00:02:59.330> bit<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.569> noise

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
drive it makes a little bit of noise

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.660 
drive it makes a little bit of noise
well<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.260> hard<00:03:00.530> drive<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.769> Spain<00:03:01.040> has<00:03:01.640> a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
well the hard drive is Spain has a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.580 
well the hard drive is Spain has a
little<00:03:02.000> bit<00:03:02.090> shock<00:03:02.330> shock<00:03:03.170> absorption

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
little bit shock shock absorption

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.780 
little bit shock shock absorption
feature<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.159> still<00:03:04.340> won't<00:03:04.400> pick<00:03:04.610> up<00:03:04.640> a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
feature and I still won't pick up a

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.289 
feature and I still won't pick up a
those<00:03:04.940> vibrations<00:03:05.299> okay<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:07.519> guys<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
those vibrations okay so guys this is

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.820 
those vibrations okay so guys this is
the<00:03:08.390> setup<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.780> actually<00:03:08.900> used<00:03:09.319> when<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.709> at
