00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.280
Hehe! That's right Fred!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.220
After we, Lebanese, broke the world record for 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.080
the biggest hummus plate, the longest labneh sandwich,

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:12.393
and the biggest kebbeh piece in the world;

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.540
we celebrate today because Lebanon is placed on the map again.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.594
It's true Vanessa.

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:21.515
And we, at Beirut+ TV, are proud

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.680
to be the first to share the details of this event exclusively

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.500
on our screen. Let us go together with the viewers

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660
to know more with our colleague Roy,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.040
right from the center of the action.

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:32.595
Roy?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.800
That's right, Fred!

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.380
As you know, the Lebanese people can adapt,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.980
no matter what the circumstances are.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.080
I am broadcasting live from Antelias,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.220
and next to me, is the contractor Shukri Atallah.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.640
Shukri has proudly broken the world record

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.420
for the longest running roadwork in history.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.220
Mr. Shukri: you have entered the Guinness book in full power.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.040
What can you tell us about your experience?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.120
Honestly, I'm as surprised as you are today.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.220
Time really does fly.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.700
It's as if we started the roadworks yesterday, man.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.980
Indeed. Tell us, why did it take so much time?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.320
Is it a difficult project?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.260
No, man! We just need to install a new sewage system 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.380
and put asphalt on the road.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.620
In other countries, this would take 3 to 4 days.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.900
But thank God, it took us 2 years.

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:23.952
Tell us in detail what happened exactly.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.560
When we first started digging, 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.940
we accidentally broke an essential water pipe.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.520
We contacted the water company.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.580
It took them 2 to 3 weeks to fix it.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.240
Anyway, we didn't just wait around in the meantime.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.000
But our engineer held the map in reverse by mistake,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.240
so we ended up digging to the east side instead of the west one.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880
Anyway, after solving this issue,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.680
the holidays came, so we took a little break.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:47.455
During that time, they started digging for the phone lines

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.120
and we had to wait for them.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.980
Then, we immediately found ourselves breaking the world record, man.

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:56.854
Very nice! And as I can see, you're distributing baklava?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.980
[chuckles] Not only baklava.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.460
Tonight we're throwing a "jazal" evening in the plaza.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.340
Although people were bothered at the beginning,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.160
because of all the dust and broken tyres,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.920
but today, everyone is happy and sharing the excitement.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.840
And I have a surprise for you today.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.400
Go ahead.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.340
We have decided to extend the project.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.640
We will not be adding the asphalt before 2 or 3 years.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.680
That way, we can be sure that nobody will break our record.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320
Thank you. Thank you Mr. Shukri for your efforts.

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.260
We will now return to our studios.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.460
Over to you, Fred.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.040
Over to you, Fred.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.520
Fred!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.160
Fred?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
