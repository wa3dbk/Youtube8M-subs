this<00:01:26.430> sort<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.760> weird<00:01:26.940> thing<00:01:27.120> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.300> think<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
this sort of weird thing and I think a

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.730 
this sort of weird thing and I think a
lot<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:27.900> fall<00:01:28.080> into<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> trap<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lot of people fall into that trap and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.990 
lot of people fall into that trap and
I'm<00:01:28.800> not<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.070> talking<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.400> Carl<00:01:29.700> anymore

I'm not even talking about Carl anymore

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.400 
I'm not even talking about Carl anymore
because<00:01:30.120> Carl<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.510> actually<00:01:30.870> really<00:01:31.020> good<00:01:31.260> oh

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
because Carl is actually really good oh

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.590 
because Carl is actually really good oh
yeah<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> he<00:01:31.950> doesn't<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

right<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:02.760> lot<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.120> time<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:03.720> not

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
right a lot of the time so I'm not

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.420 
right a lot of the time so I'm not
picking<00:02:04.260> on<00:02:04.350> how<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.860> wanna<00:02:05.010> make<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> there

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
picking on how just wanna make it there

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
picking on how just wanna make it there
when<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.720> off<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.870> this<00:02:07.140> tangent

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
when we're going off on this tangent

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.639 
when we're going off on this tangent
it's<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.459> about<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.060> him<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.509> about<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:10.470> in

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it's not about to him it's about just in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
it's not about to him it's about just in
general<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.250> mistake<00:02:11.550> that's<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:12.239> easy

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
general it's a mistake that's very easy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.390 
general it's a mistake that's very easy
to<00:02:12.599> make<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.019> evidence<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.950> them<00:02:14.129> all

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
to make and this is evidence to them all

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.949 
to make and this is evidence to them all
right<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.269> are<00:02:15.300> very<00:02:15.659> good<00:02:15.930> at

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
right that even if you are very good at

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.410 
right that even if you are very good at
you<00:02:16.440> know<00:02:16.470> making<00:02:16.920> things<00:02:17.099> sort<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> fun<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you know making things sort of fun and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420 
you know making things sort of fun and
interesting<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.989> reading<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.220> have

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
interesting and reading you can have

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
interesting and reading you can have
those<00:02:20.610> sort<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.909> missteps<00:02:21.290> we're<00:02:22.290> kind<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
those sort of missteps we're kind of

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.949 
those sort of missteps we're kind of
like<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.459> mean<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.120> goes<00:02:24.629> back<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
like and I mean it's it goes back to a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.759 
like and I mean it's it goes back to a
little<00:02:25.050> bit<00:02:25.170> where<00:02:25.319> we're<00:02:25.440> talking<00:02:25.530> about

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
little bit where we're talking about

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit where we're talking about
before<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.099> think<00:02:26.519> on<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> last<00:02:26.790> series<00:02:27.240> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
before I think on the last series is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.020 
before I think on the last series is
that<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.440> internalize<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.430> things<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that you internalize these things and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.370 
that you internalize these things and
you<00:02:30.180> sort<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> take<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> personally<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you sort of take it personally and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
you sort of take it personally and
you're<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.590> no<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.520> changing<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.000> I'm

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
you're like no I'm not changing this I'm

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.840 
you're like no I'm not changing this I'm
standing<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.510> ground<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:35.640> just

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.809 
on the day we went gold I think I was
like<00:03:38.459> all<00:03:38.730> right

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
like all right

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.660 
like all right
I<00:03:40.849> think<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.870> think<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.319> was<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.890> designer

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
I think I think it was a designer

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.289 
I think I think it was a designer
actually<00:03:44.180> got<00:03:44.329> it<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.540> deadlocked<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.180> think

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
actually got it on deadlocked so I think

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.030 
actually got it on deadlocked so I think
I<00:03:47.569> think<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:47.900> even<00:03:48.079> switched<00:03:48.379> departments

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
I think it even switched departments

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.410 
I think it even switched departments
which<00:03:49.219> is<00:03:49.579> kind<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:49.849> crazy

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
which is kind of crazy

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.759 
which is kind of crazy

dots all right well you know what I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.490 
dots all right well you know what I
think<00:04:58.400> that's<00:04:58.610> enough<00:04:59.030> for<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.840> planet<00:05:00.260> Terra

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
think that's enough for the planet Terra

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.400 
think that's enough for the planet Terra
gnosis<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.300> think<00:05:02.570> we<00:05:02.690> should<00:05:02.930> we<00:05:03.380> should

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410
