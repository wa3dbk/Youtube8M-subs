00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
about 50 bucks or so at Sephora so my

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.760 
about 50 bucks or so at Sephora so my
next<00:01:17.630> favorite<00:01:17.929> is<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.259> angled<00:01:18.649> eyeliner

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
next favorite is this angled eyeliner

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.310 
next favorite is this angled eyeliner
brush<00:01:19.100> from<00:01:19.549> ELF<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.329> it<00:01:20.749> looks<00:01:20.929> like<00:01:21.079> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.349 
brush from ELF and it looks like this
and<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.070> picked<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.399> up<00:01:22.549> because<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:23.119> really

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
and I picked this up because I really

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.810 
and I picked this up because I really
like<00:01:23.659> wearing<00:01:23.960> cream<00:01:24.289> eyeliner<00:01:24.770> over<00:01:25.100> liquid
