00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
for the farm if you look at it you can

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
for the farm if you look at it you can
see<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> cover<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
see to the right there's a cover I have

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
see to the right there's a cover I have
that<00:01:21.720> God<00:01:22.049> put<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.619> few<00:01:22.799> years<00:01:22.950> ago

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that God put on there few years ago

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.260 
that God put on there few years ago
because<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> blade<00:01:23.820> used<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> completely

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because the blade used to be completely

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
because the blade used to be completely
covered<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> old<00:01:26.130> days<00:01:26.369> before

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
covered it's in the old days before

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300 
covered it's in the old days before
health<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> safety<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.600> paramount<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> what

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
health and safety was paramount so what

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.410 
health and safety was paramount so what
I'm<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> I'm<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> unbolt

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'm going to do is I'm going to unbolt

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
I'm going to do is I'm going to unbolt
this<00:01:30.720> along<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:32.210> quite<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> few<00:01:33.390> bolts<00:01:35.030> undo

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this along here quite a few bolts undo

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.440 
this along here quite a few bolts undo
the<00:01:36.119> main<00:01:36.329> bolt<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> middle<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.450> pull

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the main bolt in the middle there pull

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
the main bolt in the middle there pull
this<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.130> then<00:01:41.130> we'll<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.850> sharpened

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this off and then we'll get it sharpened

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.950 
this off and then we'll get it sharpened
that's<00:01:42.630> easier<00:01:42.899> said<00:01:43.049> than<00:01:43.140> done<00:01:43.200> because

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
that's easier said than done because

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's easier said than done because
it's<00:01:45.960> quite<00:01:46.259> tricky<00:01:46.470> undoing<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's quite tricky undoing all that and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.770 
it's quite tricky undoing all that and
pulling<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> off<00:01:47.909> I've<00:01:48.210> done<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> before

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pulling it off I've done it before

00:01:48.780 --> 00:04:15.150 
pulling it off I've done it before
anyway<00:01:49.680> let's<00:01:49.920> crack<00:01:50.130> on

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.580 

well<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.190> got<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.609> side<00:04:16.880> bit<00:04:17.150> off<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.690> don't

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
well I got this side bit off I don't

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.129 
well I got this side bit off I don't
need<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.040> take<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.190> off<00:04:19.370> completely<00:04:20.139> just

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
need to take it off completely just

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.159 
need to take it off completely just
enough<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.500> pull<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.829> blade<00:04:21.979> out<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:23.270> I'll<00:04:24.020> get

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
enough to pull the blade out so I'll get

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.510 
enough to pull the blade out so I'll get
that<00:04:24.200> big<00:04:24.500> bolt<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.860> done<00:04:25.010> there<00:04:25.160> that<00:04:25.340> is

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
that big bolt and done there that is

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.570 
that big bolt and done there that is
always<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.060> tricky<00:04:26.390> one

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
always the tricky one

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.830 
always the tricky one
like<00:04:28.580> at<00:04:28.789> one<00:04:28.940> with<00:04:29.090> its<00:04:29.210> anti-clockwise<00:04:29.660> a

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
like at one with its anti-clockwise a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.409 
like at one with its anti-clockwise a
lot<00:04:30.080> ways<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.320> do<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.500> under<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.240> got<00:04:32.390> a

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
lot ways to do it under it but I got a

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.130 
lot ways to do it under it but I got a
wedge<00:04:33.910> which<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.090> blades<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.600> might<00:04:35.780> stop<00:04:36.020> it

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
wedge which the blades I might stop it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.490 
wedge which the blades I might stop it
spinning<00:04:36.410> around

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
spinning around

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.080 
spinning around
just<00:04:39.500> do<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:42.340> well<00:04:43.340> I've<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.520> wedges<00:04:44.060> a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
just do it well I've just wedges a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.520 
just do it well I've just wedges a
little<00:04:44.300> bit<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.539> wood<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:44.870> here<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.200> stop<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
little bit of wood in here to stop the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.860 
little bit of wood in here to stop the
blade<00:04:45.710> game<00:04:45.890> rang<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.510> I'm<00:04:47.510> just<00:04:47.690> going<00:04:47.840> to

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870
