championship<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> present<00:01:36.689> moment<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
championship at the present moment and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.219

and<00:01:37.619> someone<00:01:38.369> being<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.840> Premiership<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and someone being in the Premiership I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
and someone being in the Premiership I
think<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.820> thing<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> being

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
think you know one thing which is being

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.870 
think you know one thing which is being
missing<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> Derby<00:01:43.259> games<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.920> think

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
missing is the Derby games I think

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
missing is the Derby games I think
you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.180> everybody<00:01:45.689> looks<00:01:45.869> forward<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you know everybody looks forward to the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
you know everybody looks forward to the
Derby<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> two

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
Derby I think when you when the two

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
Derby I think when you when the two
clubs<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.900> are<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> same<00:01:49.500> division<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
clubs are are in the same division I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
clubs are are in the same division I
think<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.400> first<00:01:50.520> picture<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think that's the first picture is to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.440 
think that's the first picture is to
look<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:52.259> memory<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:53.070> play

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
look out for well memory actually play

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.499 
look out for well memory actually play
each<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.690> them<00:01:57.860> obviously<00:01:59.090> it's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.360> game

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
each of them obviously it's a one game

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
each of them obviously it's a one game
you<00:02:00.630> look<00:02:00.750> forward<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.170> season

and get the ban lifted we set up a group
called<00:03:02.350> we<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.740> Oakland<00:03:03.070> in<00:03:03.160> Newcastle

files<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.060> Sunderland<00:03:04.270> fans<00:03:04.600> work<00:03:04.780> together

files and Sunderland fans work together

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.770 
files and Sunderland fans work together
and<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.790> rivalry<00:03:07.240> probably<00:03:07.540> stems

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and I think the rivalry probably stems

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.660 
and I think the rivalry probably stems
from<00:03:08.070> initially<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> sort<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.490> holy

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
from initially the sort of holy

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.310 
from initially the sort of holy
economics<00:03:10.180> or<00:03:10.330> battle<00:03:10.690> between<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:11.200> than

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
economics or battle between some than

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.840 
economics or battle between some than
the<00:03:11.380> Newcastle<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.010> two<00:03:12.220> cities<00:03:12.610> because

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
the Newcastle is two cities because

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.670 
the Newcastle is two cities because
obviously<00:03:13.000> someone<00:03:13.540> was<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.350> biggest

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
obviously someone was the is the biggest

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.950 
obviously someone was the is the biggest
city<00:03:14.830> population<00:03:15.550> wise<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.810> whole

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
shipyards heritage made something like a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.920 
shipyards heritage made something like a
massive<00:03:20.830> City<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:21.450> post-second<00:03:22.450> World<00:03:22.510> War

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
poured more money into Newcastle and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.930 
poured more money into Newcastle and
that<00:03:26.800> did<00:03:26.950> someone<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.460> mid<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
that did someone in a mid it like the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.790 
that did someone in a mid it like the
regional<00:03:28.120> capital<00:03:28.540> where<00:03:29.140> as<00:03:29.230> Durham<00:03:29.590> was<00:03:29.770> I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
regional capital where as Durham was I

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.060 
regional capital where as Durham was I
think<00:03:30.100> before<00:03:30.430> then<00:03:30.640> historically<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.950> I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
think before then historically and I

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.320 
think before then historically and I
think<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:33.400> was<00:03:33.490> things<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.090> lot<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.240> people

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
think there was things a lot of people

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.970 
think there was things a lot of people
from<00:03:34.600> someone<00:03:34.930> had<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.140> go<00:03:35.260> through<00:03:35.440> Newcastle

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
from someone had to go through Newcastle

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.010 
from someone had to go through Newcastle
to<00:03:36.070> work<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.640> obviously<00:03:37.300> with<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.690> cities

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
to work and obviously with the cities

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.420 
to work and obviously with the cities
being<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.440> close<00:03:38.800> but<00:03:39.010> only<00:03:39.130> having<00:03:39.340> one

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
being so close but only having one

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.150 
being so close but only having one
football<00:03:39.940> team<00:03:40.180> each<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> creates<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
football team each like it creates a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.380 
football team each like it creates a
rivalry

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.680
