00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
obvious is when you look at these things
like<00:00:27.090> Eenie<00:00:27.449> surveys<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.050> wheeler<00:00:28.320> surveys

war nobody really knew what it looked

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.359 
war nobody really knew what it looked
like<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.049> you<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.530> maps<00:00:58.769> from<00:00:58.979> that<00:00:59.190> era

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
like and you look at maps from that era

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.469 
like and you look at maps from that era
there's<00:00:59.610> vast<00:01:00.150> swaths<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:01.080> unexplored

territories or unexplored regions these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
territories or unexplored regions these
are<00:01:05.880> blank<00:01:06.240> spots<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> map<00:01:06.960> real

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
are blank spots on the map real

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.359 
are blank spots on the map real
classical<00:01:07.950> blank<00:01:08.220> spots<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> map<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:11.100> tend

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
classical blank spots on the map we tend

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
classical blank spots on the map we tend
to<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> Timothy<00:01:12.240> O'Sullivan<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> kind

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to think of Timothy O'Sullivan as a kind

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
to think of Timothy O'Sullivan as a kind
of<00:01:13.530> art<00:01:13.860> landscape<00:01:14.280> photographer<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.359> was

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of art landscape photographer and he was

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.289 
of art landscape photographer and he was
but<00:01:16.200> he<00:01:16.289> was<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> spy<00:01:17.070> satellite<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
but he was also a spy satellite and I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.099 
but he was also a spy satellite and I
think<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> his<00:01:19.079> career<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
think that his career really was one of

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.359 
think that his career really was one of
the<00:01:23.780> points<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.899> multiple<00:01:25.590> histories<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the points were multiple histories of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.289 
the points were multiple histories of
photography<00:01:27.119> diverged<00:01:27.929> from<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> again<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
photography diverged from and again this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
photography diverged from and again this
is<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.719> particular<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.460> United<00:01:32.789> States

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
is very particular to the United States

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
is very particular to the United States
and<00:01:33.210> particularly<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> West<00:01:34.530> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and particularly actually to the West as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
and particularly actually to the West as
well<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.999> think<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:37.560> O'Sullivan<00:01:38.630> legacy<00:01:39.630> as

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
well but I think of O'Sullivan legacy as

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.580 
well but I think of O'Sullivan legacy as
being<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.259> only<00:01:40.289> people<00:01:41.039> like<00:01:41.189> me<00:01:41.429> but<00:01:41.969> also

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
being not only people like me but also

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
being not only people like me but also
spy<00:01:43.590> satellites<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> skies<00:01:44.850> above<00:01:44.880> us<00:01:45.359> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
spy satellites in the skies above us and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.029 
spy satellites in the skies above us and
and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:45.929> mean<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.469> just<00:01:46.679> in<00:01:46.890> an

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
and I don't mean that just in an

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.099 
and I don't mean that just in an
ideological<00:01:47.219> sense<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> trace<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.929> the

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
ideological sense when you trace out the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.230 
ideological sense when you trace out the
history<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> Technology<00:01:50.249> that's<00:01:50.759> been<00:01:50.969> funded

history of Technology that's been funded

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.349 
history of Technology that's been funded
by<00:01:51.420> militaries<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.670> military

funding of photographic technologies

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
funding of photographic technologies
again<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> find<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.179> line<00:01:57.359> that<00:01:57.509> goes<00:01:57.569> straight

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
again you find a line that goes straight

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.920 
again you find a line that goes straight
back<00:01:58.109> to<00:01:58.469> Timothy<00:01:58.829> O'Sullivan
