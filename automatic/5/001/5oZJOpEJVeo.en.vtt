you<00:00:34.000> know<00:00:34.150> it's<00:00:34.870> important<00:00:35.470> if<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.890> crowd<00:00:36.130> are

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
it's expensive holiday so we get wet the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's expensive holiday so we get wet the
only<00:00:42.100> one<00:00:42.220> who<00:00:42.280> stays<00:00:42.490> dry<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.790> Larry<00:00:43.440> wet

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440

drums<00:00:44.739> don't<00:00:44.980> work<00:00:45.220> at<00:00:45.370> all<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:46.000> mean<00:00:46.660> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
drums don't work at all so I mean the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.510 
drums don't work at all so I mean the
show's<00:00:47.020> changed<00:00:47.650> radically<00:00:47.860> since<00:00:48.340> it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
show's changed radically since it

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.570 
show's changed radically since it
started<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.970> show<00:00:52.360> was<00:00:52.650> was<00:00:53.650> really<00:00:54.129> the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
started and that show was was really the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.340 
started and that show was was really the
springboard<00:00:55.059> for<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.360> shows<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.780> ruse

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 

on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.650> horizon<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.340> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.180> still<00:01:00.989> an

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
on the horizon which which is still an

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.969 
on the horizon which which is still an
important<00:01:01.470> part<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> set<00:01:02.610> but<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
important part of the set but we

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.640 
important part of the set but we
probably<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.280> had<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.790> better<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
probably have had now better time to

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.789 
probably have had now better time to
focus<00:01:07.650> on

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
focus on

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.789 
focus on
the<00:01:09.250> back<00:01:09.430> catalog<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.210> material<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.229> start

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
the back catalog of material and start

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.520 
the back catalog of material and start
to<00:01:11.890> dry<00:01:12.130> out<00:01:12.159> some<00:01:12.429> gems<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:14.439> know

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
to dry out some gems and you know

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.590 
to dry out some gems and you know
reapply<00:01:15.460> them<00:01:15.609> into<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:15.969> production<00:01:16.329> and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
reapply them into this production and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.990 
reapply them into this production and
that's<00:01:16.869> been<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.079> lot<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.289> fun<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:18.000> we've

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
that's been a lot of fun so we've

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.490 
that's been a lot of fun so we've
replaced<00:01:19.509> ours<00:01:20.079> that<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:24.149> used<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.500> we're

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
replaced ours that we used and we're

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
replaced ours that we used and we're
just<00:01:26.590> having<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.890> lot<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.039> fun<00:01:27.310> with<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just having a lot of fun with the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.080 
just having a lot of fun with the
running<00:01:28.750> order<00:01:28.899> set<00:01:29.259> list<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
running order set list and this

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.440 
running order set list and this
production<00:01:31.509> lends<00:01:31.840> itself<00:01:32.200> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
production lends itself to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.889 
production lends itself to
to<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:35.240> focused<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.600> one

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
to that it's not so focused on one

to that it's not so focused on one
particular<00:01:37.909> record

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 

I<00:02:11.180> think<00:02:12.019> we<00:02:12.140> will<00:02:12.290> continue<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.860> play<00:02:12.980> some<00:02:13.250> of

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I think we will continue to play some of

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.630 
I think we will continue to play some of
the<00:02:13.370> older<00:02:13.670> stuff

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the older stuff

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.970 
the older stuff
we<00:02:16.180> might<00:02:16.450> add<00:02:16.660> Samuels<00:02:17.260> because<00:02:17.620> we've<00:02:17.800> been

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
we might add Samuels because we've been

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.220 
we might add Samuels because we've been
riding<00:02:18.160> some<00:02:18.550> throughout<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.000> south
