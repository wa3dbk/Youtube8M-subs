00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
it's pretty crafty but I believe this

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.640 
it's pretty crafty but I believe this
place<00:00:25.000> was<00:00:25.300> started<00:00:25.660> here<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.019> Alabama<00:00:26.410> by

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.000 
would like to sip and there is an
instructor<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.440> usually<00:00:41.559> takes<00:00:41.890> about

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
instructor and it usually takes about

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.490 
instructor and it usually takes about
three<00:00:42.399> hours<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:43.000> basically<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:44.020> every

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
three hours and basically that every

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.080 
three hours and basically that every
night<00:00:44.680> they<00:00:44.920> have<00:00:45.039> a<00:00:45.070> different<00:00:45.280> painting<00:00:45.879> and

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
night they have a different painting and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.200 
night they have a different painting and
it<00:00:46.180> may<00:00:46.360> be<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:47.410> painting<00:00:48.160> from<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.489> artist

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210

it may be a painting from the artist
that<00:00:49.329> I<00:00:49.660> guess<00:00:49.899> came<00:00:50.230> up<00:00:50.410> with<00:00:50.530> whole<00:00:50.739> sips<00:00:51.340> and

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
that I guess came up with whole sips and

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.040 
that I guess came up with whole sips and
strokes<00:00:51.760> concept<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.629> think<00:00:52.809> her<00:00:52.870> name<00:00:53.020> is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050

a<00:00:58.090> well-known<00:00:58.719> famous<00:00:59.350> type<00:00:59.649> honey<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.160> I've

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
a well-known famous type honey and I've

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.430 
a well-known famous type honey and I've
been<00:01:01.090> twice<00:01:01.390> and<00:01:01.840> I've<00:01:01.930> been<00:01:02.050> one<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.320> each

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
been twice and I've been one of each

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.890 
been twice and I've been one of each
someone<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.949> show<00:01:03.160> you<00:01:03.219> guys<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.660> first

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
someone to show you guys so the first

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.080 
someone to show you guys so the first
time<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.170> ever<00:01:05.200> went<00:01:05.440> was<00:01:05.710> last<00:01:06.130> year<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.880> i

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
time I ever went was last year and i

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.320 
time I ever went was last year and i
went<00:01:07.300> to<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.570> location<00:01:08.110> in<00:01:08.320> birmingham<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
went to a location in birmingham and we

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.270 
went to a location in birmingham and we
did<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> well-known<00:01:11.290> painting<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:11.980> i<00:01:12.010> think

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
did a well-known painting and i think

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.490 
did a well-known painting and i think
this<00:01:12.430> one<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.670> called<00:01:13.300> squares<00:01:14.110> with

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
this one is called squares with

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.960 
this one is called squares with
concentric<00:01:15.040> circles<00:01:15.820> by<00:01:17.340> Kandinsky<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.580> think

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
concentric circles by Kandinsky I think

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.910 
concentric circles by Kandinsky I think
that's<00:01:19.180> right<00:01:19.620> but<00:01:20.620> this<00:01:21.580> is<00:01:21.730> what<00:01:21.910> we<00:01:22.060> did<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
that's right but this is what we did and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.010 
that's right but this is what we did and
we've<00:01:24.790> all<00:01:24.970> seen<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:25.330> picture<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.810> all<00:01:25.900> know

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
we've all seen this picture we all know

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.370 
we've all seen this picture we all know
what<00:01:26.050> that<00:01:26.290> looks<00:01:26.500> like<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:27.340> um<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:29.020> somebody

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
what that looks like but um for somebody

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.140 
what that looks like but um for somebody
that<00:01:29.440> has<00:01:29.680> no<00:01:29.950> artistic<00:01:30.370> skill<00:01:30.760> when<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:31.000> comes

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
that has no artistic skill when it comes

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.000 
that has no artistic skill when it comes
to<00:01:31.270> some<00:01:31.480> stuff<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.110> whatsoever<00:01:32.530> is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010

some girlfriends and stuff in it I think

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.449 
some girlfriends and stuff in it I think
it<00:03:10.989> cost<00:03:11.139> thirty-five<00:03:11.620> dollars<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.220> night

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
it cost thirty-five dollars that night

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.449 
it cost thirty-five dollars that night
depending<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.780> size<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> picture<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
depending on the size of the picture and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.909 
depending on the size of the picture and
how<00:03:16.030> long<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.389> takes<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.900> ranges<00:03:17.290> from<00:03:17.349> 25<00:03:17.769> to

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
how long it takes it ranges from 25 to

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.080 
how long it takes it ranges from 25 to
45<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.220> was<00:03:21.400> definitely<00:03:21.790> worth

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
45 so if this was definitely worth

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.729 
45 so if this was definitely worth
thirty-five<00:03:22.660> dollars<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.169> three<00:03:23.410> hours

thirty-five dollars in the three hours

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.659
