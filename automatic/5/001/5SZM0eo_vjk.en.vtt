XD<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> b-side<00:00:58.559> index<00:00:59.100> C<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> side

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
XD on the b-side index C on the a side

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
XD on the b-side index C on the a side
so<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> means<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.230> transport
