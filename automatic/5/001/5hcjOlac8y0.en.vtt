00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hi I'm Karen for expert village now I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.200 
hi I'm Karen for expert village now I'm
ready<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.840> put<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.140> lattice<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.980> pie

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
ready to put the lattice on the pie

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.270 
ready to put the lattice on the pie
first<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> brush<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.319> edge<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
first I'm going to brush the edge with a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.850 
first I'm going to brush the edge with a
little<00:00:08.550> egg<00:00:08.790> white<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.019> those<00:00:10.320> lattice

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
little egg white so that those lattice

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.209 
little egg white so that those lattice
pieces<00:00:11.460> will<00:00:11.759> stick<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.440> bottom<00:00:13.799> pie

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
pieces will stick to the bottom pie

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.990 
pieces will stick to the bottom pie
crust<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.540> take<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.750> egg<00:00:16.080> white<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
crust so just take that egg white and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.349 
crust so just take that egg white and
brush<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> edge<00:00:18.690> yeah<00:00:19.529> lightly<00:00:20.359> okay

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
brush just the edge yeah lightly okay

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.029 
brush just the edge yeah lightly okay
we'll<00:00:22.020> start<00:00:22.380> by<00:00:22.529> laying<00:00:22.800> six<00:00:23.640> strips<00:00:25.039> across

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
we'll start by laying six strips across

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.709 
we'll start by laying six strips across
the<00:00:26.670> pie<00:00:30.619> evenly<00:00:31.640> across<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.940> pie<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.540> two

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the pie evenly across the pie one two

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.910 
the pie evenly across the pie one two
three<00:00:34.020> four<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:37.100> little<00:00:38.100> closer<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:39.920> five

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
three four a little closer there five

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.160 
three four a little closer there five
and<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> short<00:00:42.210> ones<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> ends<00:00:44.149> six

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and use the short ones for the ends six

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.770 
and use the short ones for the ends six
okay<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> fold<00:00:47.460> back<00:00:47.780> every

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
okay now we're going to fold back every

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
okay now we're going to fold back every
other<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> center<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:54.469> then

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
other one just to the center and then

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.090 
other one just to the center and then
place<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> long<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:57.680> down<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> center

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
place a long one right down the center

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
place a long one right down the center
and<00:01:01.489> fold<00:01:02.489> those<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:05.900> now<00:01:07.640> fold<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and fold those back now fold back the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
and fold those back now fold back the
other<00:01:10.110> every<00:01:10.590> other<00:01:10.619> ones<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.830> place<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> strip

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
other every other ones and place a strip

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.899 
other every other ones and place a strip
across<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.240> fold<00:01:21.240> fold<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.259> back

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
across like that and fold fold it back

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
across like that and fold fold it back
being<00:01:23.909> careful<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> tear<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.530> crust<00:01:25.830> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
being careful not to tear the crust as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
being careful not to tear the crust as
you<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.390> again<00:01:27.780> we're<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> fold

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you go now again we're going to fold

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.319 
you go now again we're going to fold
back<00:01:28.950> every<00:01:29.610> other<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> opposite<00:01:31.770> ones

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
back every other one the opposite ones

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
back every other one the opposite ones
and<00:01:33.329> we'll<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> shorter<00:01:34.409> piece<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and we'll use a shorter piece for the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.620 
and we'll use a shorter piece for the
finishing<00:01:35.970> bit<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:38.100> fold<00:01:38.490> fold<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
finishing bit and then fold fold that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.490 
finishing bit and then fold fold that
back<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> nice<00:01:43.619> woven<00:01:44.280> pattern<00:01:45.500> let's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
back you have a nice woven pattern let's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
back you have a nice woven pattern let's
turn<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> start

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
turn it around now we're going to start

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.170 
turn it around now we're going to start
again<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> center<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> way

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
again from the center and going this way

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
again from the center and going this way
you<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> isn't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you want to think about now this isn't

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.780 
you want to think about now this isn't
over

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
over

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030 
over
so<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.299> has<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.720> an<00:01:54.899> under<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so this has to be an under so all the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880 
so this has to be an under so all the
unders<00:01:56.520> we're<00:01:57.030> gonna<00:01:57.149> fold<00:01:57.540> here's<00:01:58.290> an<00:01:58.500> over

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
unders we're gonna fold here's an over

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.639 
unders we're gonna fold here's an over
now<00:01:59.219> next<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.820> need<00:01:59.969> an<00:02:00.119> under<00:02:00.479> let's<00:02:01.320> fold

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
now next we need an under let's fold

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
now next we need an under let's fold
that<00:02:01.829> back<00:02:01.890> every<00:02:02.640> other<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:05.210> place<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.450> pie

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that back every other one place our pie

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.890 
that back every other one place our pie
crust<00:02:06.890> gently<00:02:07.890> across

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
crust gently across

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.630 
crust gently across
fold<00:02:10.900> it<00:02:11.080> back<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.920> repeat<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
fold it back and now repeat with the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.270 
fold it back and now repeat with the
other<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:17.310> every<00:02:18.310> other<00:02:18.430> one<00:02:19.830> place<00:02:20.830> your<00:02:21.070> pie

fold that over and now we're finished

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.310 
fold that over and now we're finished
with<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> lattice<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.600> next<00:02:41.020> we're<00:02:41.170> going<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
with the lattice and next we're going to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.100 
with the lattice and next we're going to
crimp<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.770> edge
