00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 yes, what i just do today with him on the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.910
 want to give away is gold and see 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.700
 silver as an important ingredient for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.349
 It has assets to the mass 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.330
 not you know the saying what you are there 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.640
 already white does not make me hot yes so 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.489
 if someone in the gym sometimes 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 so i have experienced the time 2000 yes in 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.930
 Gym where more lawyers dentists 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 said what stocks I need 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 and they know what that means when the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.170
 arrive and all say to me human 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 Do you already have gold and silver then? 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.010
 I'll say yes, I really wanted that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.200
 I like to give you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 We are not in the bubble that would like 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 i just bring it to the conclusion i 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.900
 stand to gold and silver where that too 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 In the next few months I believe 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.070
 this is an incredible and ultimate 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 Buying opportunity is for you in the next 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 maybe even weeks or even days 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.610
 but now this correction phase 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.439
 is an incredible opportunity for me 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.670
 and that's the final word then I hear 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 but you can contact me 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.970
 Equally appeal if you still 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 ask again to participate 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.229
 there was a very strong collapse in 2008 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 the gold and silver prices are similarly strong 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 but over a few weeks this time 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.789
 over three days this is the unique 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.920
 in the current situation and afterwards 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.200
 gold and silver are still on much 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 higher levels have risen 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 and despite all manipulation I can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 The system could not tell them 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.460
 the triumphal procession was over 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.310
 2001 at 4 dollars 0 4 and is up to date 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.139
 at 23 or 24 dollars and stood up in the high 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 at $ 50 that was one too 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.520
 exaggeration before I warned then 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.389
 have that gold at a low x 254 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.029
 dollar and today stands at 1400 dollars 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:58.439
 about 48 and the final word of mine 

00:01:54.029 --> 00:02:01.319
 I firmly believe in it and I say 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.060
 To finish we still have use 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.029
 around 5000 billion euros 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920
 real estate assets in Germany the 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:10.110
 we have about 5000 citizens 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.240
 billion euros in cash assets 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.520
 we have about 160 billion at 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.220
 current prices in gold and we have 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.200
 a vanishingly tiny sum of 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 six to seven billion the die 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.430
 physically owned by a citizen in silver 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.270
 and that's why I feel further 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.060
 where the paper money market in new york 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.709
 or the comex the gold and silver price 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.069
 always in the next few weeks 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.069
 will drive
