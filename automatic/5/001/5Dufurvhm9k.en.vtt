devices or each major inch devices and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.610 
devices or each major inch devices and
see<00:02:35.879> if<00:02:36.030> people<00:02:36.569> enjoy<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.110> lot<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.470> mean

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
see if people enjoy that a lot I mean

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.690

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
I've had a lot of success with the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
I've had a lot of success with the
galaxy<00:02:39.030> s3<00:02:39.329> mini<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.200> galaxy<00:02:40.530> s<00:02:40.590> 2<00:02:40.739> plus<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
galaxy s3 mini the galaxy s 2 plus and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.699 
galaxy s3 mini the galaxy s 2 plus and
hopefully<00:02:41.940> Windows<00:02:42.269> Phone<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.019> could<00:02:43.319> become

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
hopefully Windows Phone it could become

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.009 
hopefully Windows Phone it could become
a<00:02:44.010> bigger<00:02:44.280> operating<00:02:44.760> system<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.120> iOS

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
a bigger operating system because iOS

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.630 
a bigger operating system because iOS
and<00:02:46.200> Android<00:02:46.260> sometimes<00:02:47.159> people<00:02:47.489> want

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and Android sometimes people want

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.849

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
they do videos you should do short

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.140 
they do videos you should do short
videos<00:03:09.599> they<00:03:09.810> don't<00:03:09.989> go<00:03:10.170> in-depth<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.879> like
