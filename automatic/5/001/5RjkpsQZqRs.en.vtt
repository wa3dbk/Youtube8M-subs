00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.560
 you had a new video today 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.500
 I bring a boxing and the review of the 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.360
 audis and lower east side stockings takers 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.980
 they are high quality speakers and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.630
 design and good let's start to see the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.609
 design of the box so there is not a 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.269
 little description in English and in 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.800
 French 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.179
 here it tells us that it is compatible good 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.669
 with several apple tv models and 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.880
 computers televisions hd blue and 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.380
 blu-ray dvd player and satellite boxes 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.659
 Playstation 3 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.360
 iphone ipad then basically 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.190
 compatible with all products with 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960
 those that we can use some horn 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.730
 in the bottom part we see some 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.440
 images just like in the part 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.970
 lateral and in the trailers deal 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.160
 description in other languages including 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.410
 the Spanish and in the back same 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.940
 brings us some images and gives us some 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.440
 specifications and what we found 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.090
 inside the box so let's open 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.650
 the box and let's see what it is that brings 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.790
 inside good inside the box what 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.860
 first thing we're going to find is the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.690
 manual and probably have many 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.600
 languages ​​including Spanish here is 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.940
 the normal is quite small and this is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.740
 so that tells us how it connects 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.550
 and between the wires between the two speakers 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.980
 Y 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.540
 the box comes this protection for us 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.270
 that the aducidas is not damaged or anything of the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 that brings and good we see that it gives us the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.310
 cable to connect from one speaker to another 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.850
 and pass current and logically in the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.560
 audio comes a 3.5 to 3.5 cable and 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.330
 this is for us to connect from a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.460
 side our device composed a 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.950
 ipad an iphone and on the other side of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.670
 speakers from her we can pass audio from 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.380
 side to side 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 here brings us half the cable of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 current with this is the box the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.300
 regulator so you do not get too much 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.830
 energy when here is the extension 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.720
 to connect to the current that 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.940
 logically it goes here and well here already the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.710
 current and logically this is going 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.050
 the speakers and everyone watching us 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 we found in the box are the speakers 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.710
 equal to the horns they are quite heavy 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.080
 they basically have many components 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.850
 inside this is a kind of cloth and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.340
 complete to the tail truth that a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.770
 awesome design here is the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.750
 connection for 3.5 cable and good in 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.810
 the back we found the cables 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.640
 to send the signal from a speaker to the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 another logically in the back of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.210
 he's only going to have those tickets 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.300
 that go up to the power input and 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.790
 the 3.5 and the 3.5 back 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 the device in case we want and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.510
 the opposite was connected and some 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 hearing aids for example the truth that the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.890
 design these kitchens is very very nice 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 very aesthetic in a way that brings in the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.940
 box but to make them a green view and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.920
 with arguments I will test the horns for 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.780
 a couple of days and I will give them in my opinion 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.030
 when they have spent a couple of days and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.470
 we are with the radius of the horns and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.940
 as first of all the speakers have 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.370
 worked pretty well I have 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.680
 delighted and as I told you the cost 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.210
 it's $ 250 but there's a discount 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.610
 of wells there you can get it by 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.590
 150 dollars then it is a great offer 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.090
 I think your offer is limited but 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.100
 logically you to pay that amount 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.870
 of the price they wonder what is it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.850
 that I'm paying and good logically in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.550
 how much audio quality do they receive? 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.990
 250 dollars is the 150 dollars in case 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.210
 that they are offering will receive it 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.890
 totally in the audio quality not 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.900
 it's just the quality of the audio but 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 that also the design of the speakers and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.960
 the size the truth that for the quality 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.120
 audio that have the size is very 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.950
 reduced recitals do not care about the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.270
 size and they care a lot about the quality 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.820
 of sound the truth that the quality of 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 sound is impressive in the part of 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.340
 back has this buffer that the truth 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.040
 makes the audio perfect 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.800
 feel all the south so to speak all 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.480
 those who understand it and the truth that the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.940
 power is also pretty good 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.040
 logically if you expect to receive much 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.140
 a lot of audio is eating logically 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 better some other kind of speakers because 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.580
 this is more for quality and not for high 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.110
 volume although logically if it brings very 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.670
 very high volume if you want to use them 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.190
 for a party or something like that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.920
 this is going to work if you have a small 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.780
 meeting in your room for example in a 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.519
 small meeting simply washes that if 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.069
 I'll serve you like about 20 people 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.569
 but the audio is not that strong 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.310
 logically if it's very decent but not 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.810
 for a big party and how do I 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.269
 they wait in the back simply 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.310
 they have the connection to current input 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.870
 for 35 mm cable that is the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.940
 universal input for any 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.190
 audio device and input to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.019
 hd televisions do not want to spend 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.579
 both in a home theater the truth that 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.720
 after my perfect option they can put it 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.340
 on your television and it's going to go pretty 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 good for horror movies is going to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.980
 work quite well is that as they 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.269
 I say the surround 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.430
 the truth that is very good none 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.139
 lower price kitchen is going to achieve 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.090
 so it was so this is the plus that 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.860
 you have with these horns in terms of 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 material of them the truth that that 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.789
 it looks like it's a plastic I'm not 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.319
 sure but the truth that simulates as if 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.629
 it was very light do not simulate it in 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.310
 reality is very rigid this is metal 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.139
 the truth that the design is impressive 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.270
 this if you ask if you can 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.889
 remove can not be removed and in words 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.770
 that go well with the design of the 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.060
 horn I love how it looks with this 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.879
 have a pair of gummies to make 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.159
 perfectly on the table and do not scratch 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.780
 the material of the horns or the same 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.270
 table facing the front 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.729
 like a classic speaker cloth is not 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.590
 bigger thing but logically here is going to 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.360
 have a light that subtraction will see it and 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.979
 here is the entry for hearing aids and in 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.779
 If you want to listen to hearing aids 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.009
 that they could do it by connecting it 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.289
 directly to the speaker and not 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.879
 directly to the team where they are 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.500
 listening to many of you know the 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.719
 hearing aids beats by dr 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.789
 Well, practically these are the beats 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.159
 only the beats are from a 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.139
 very high price and actually pay the 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.639
 audio quality and isolate the sound 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.289
 Well basically it 's the same with these 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.210
 kitchens since it gives you the same design 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.310
 pretty smart that has a beats by 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.199
 example and you pay design for quality 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.759
 well now connect the speakers to the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.160
 current and as you can see there is a focus that 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.740
 and put behind 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.360
 and when we press this button it gets in 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.430
 green since the speakers are on 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.770
 and from there we can control if it has 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.210
 turned off and the same here is for 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.890
 the volume with these little things you can not 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.540
 control neither the banks nor the big 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.280
 or nothing all the adjustments would have to 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.590
 be from the team but the truth that 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.630
 as for low bass high there will be 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.880
 that perfectly listen to all 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.140
 sounds and with a tremendous quality 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.970
 would give a sound test but the 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.590
 it would be very silly since you 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.300
 they need to hear the speakers and 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.700
 you would be listening to the speakers 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.020
 recorded in a microphone and microphone 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.460
 I would be listening later in the 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.840
 speakers that you have then 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.430
 will lose the quality of the lenses not 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.050
 I can show them but these kitchens 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.880
 they can try it if they want to try it and 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.590
 only from the USA with those where the 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.150
 they sell and that is where they are now 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.890
 that guarantees us that they are of quality and 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.360
 who sells them in that place and well this 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.100
 was the review of these speakers now that 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.170
 they are very good at a high cost not 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.460
 faces since they are worth every sitting of what 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.350
 that cost and I hope you liked it 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.300
 this video they want to check the 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.130
 speakers will leave the web of these 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.050
 kitchens and has some other models of 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.730
 the same brand that logically go to 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.080
 make the same quality the links go 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.670
 to be in the description and many 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.740
 Thanks for watching if you are still subscribed 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.460
 do it here is the button and give thumb 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.410
 up that are 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.919
 and it helps a lot, thank you very much for watching 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.919
 goodbye
