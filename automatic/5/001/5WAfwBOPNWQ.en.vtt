it<00:01:50.939> videos<00:01:51.240> before<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> hold<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
it videos before just have to hold the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
it videos before just have to hold the
stick<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.250> top<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> push<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
stick on top and push down and that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
stick on top and push down and that
basically<00:01:55.860> installs<00:01:56.369> onto<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> stick<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
basically installs onto the stick it's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.310 
basically installs onto the stick it's
as<00:01:57.450> simple<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
as simple as that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.660 
as simple as that
we're<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> same<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we're just going to do the same with the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
we're just going to do the same with the
other<00:01:59.790> thumbs<00:02:00.060> thick<00:02:01.040> hold<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> top<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other thumbs thick hold it on top and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.179 
other thumbs thick hold it on top and
push<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.829> now

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
push down so as you can see they are now

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
push down so as you can see they are now
installed<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> controller<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.960> basically

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
installed on the controller so basically

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
installed on the controller so basically
what<00:02:07.649> control<00:02:08.009> freaks<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.910> allow<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
what control freaks do is allow you to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.260 
what control freaks do is allow you to
have<00:02:09.810> 40%<00:02:10.289> more<00:02:10.890> range<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.310> motion<00:02:11.370> because

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
have 40% more range of motion because

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
have 40% more range of motion because
stick<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.780> extended<00:02:13.440> which<00:02:13.920> obviously<00:02:14.190> gives

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
stick is extended which obviously gives

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.390 
stick is extended which obviously gives
you<00:02:14.670> better<00:02:14.910> precision<00:02:15.390> aim<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.990> accuracy

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
you better precision aim and accuracy

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
you better precision aim and accuracy
but<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.580> also<00:02:17.730> improve<00:02:18.330> your<00:02:18.570> grip<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:19.050> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
but they also improve your grip with the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.620 
but they also improve your grip with the
laser<00:02:19.380> quality<00:02:20.130> emblem<00:02:20.850> design<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> top

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
laser quality emblem design on the top

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.060 
laser quality emblem design on the top
of<00:02:21.750> these<00:02:21.840> sticks<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> dimples<00:02:22.830> around

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
of these sticks and the dimples around

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.130 
of these sticks and the dimples around
the<00:02:23.190> outside<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:24.240> do<00:02:24.300> give<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> fantastic

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the outside they do give you fantastic

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.040 
the outside they do give you fantastic
grip<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.850> as<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.240> see<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.780> looks

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
grip and so as you can see this looks

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.330 
grip and so as you can see this looks
pretty<00:02:28.260> cool<00:02:28.530> these<00:02:28.710> sticks<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.160> really

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
cool on the black xbox360 controller but

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340 
cool on the black xbox360 controller but
let<00:02:32.460> me<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.880> point<00:02:33.120> out<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.480> these<00:02:33.630> FPS

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
let me just do point out that these FPS

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.950 
let me just do point out that these FPS
freaks<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:35.310> compatible<00:02:35.910> with<00:02:36.180> next-gen<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
freaks are compatible with next-gen so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.420 
freaks are compatible with next-gen so
they<00:02:37.080> will<00:02:37.320> work<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.830> ps4<00:02:38.130> controller

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
they will work with the ps4 controller

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.600 
they will work with the ps4 controller
and<00:02:39.150> also<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.200> Xbox<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:40.860> controller<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and also the Xbox one controller and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.690 
and also the Xbox one controller and
obviously<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.630> normal<00:02:43.170> ps3<00:02:43.770> controller<00:02:44.220> but

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
obviously the normal ps3 controller but

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.610 
obviously the normal ps3 controller but
obviously<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> Xbox<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.780> controller<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
obviously the Xbox one controller is a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.710 
obviously the Xbox one controller is a
black<00:02:47.010> currently<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.420> these

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
black currently so as you can see these

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.960 
black currently so as you can see these
white<00:02:48.990> sticks<00:02:49.320> will<00:02:49.500> suit<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.950> perfectly<00:02:50.640> so

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
