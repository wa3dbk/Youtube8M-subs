00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.440
 today we are going to do a kind of mini 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 tiny pies is like two stories 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.830
 of almonds with strawberries to make them 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.240
 we are going to need ground almonds eggs 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.190
 sugar zest of half a lemon and cinnamon 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 and then to flour the mold that 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.740
 we will use one of butter cupcakes and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.869
 good flour we need this for 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.480
 make the cards but to decorate them 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.020
 and fill them in, we're going to need 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.700
 strawberry and I'll give you two options 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.910
 filling we can also use 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 strawberry jelly good we're going to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.850
 start the dough is super easy to make 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.730
 We put the ground almonds in a bowl him 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.800
 we add the sugar the lemon zest 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.800
 and half a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.620
 ah 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.970
 Now we mix with a fork those 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.250
 ingredients we are going to follow something that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.720
 it's super easy now we add the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 eggs the 4 eggs and we also beat 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.790
 that goes without eggs 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.229
 be shaken previously as you can see there 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.910
 people who beat them but that's where I get 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.760
 same because I do not want the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.620
 cards this can be done in size 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 little note or in a big letter of course 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 Well, you see we mix a little bit with 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.080
 Take care of everything and it's super simple 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.670
 of course you're military cited 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.680
 You can make them with this cake or with 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.119
 any other good then now what 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.460
 we do is put a little butter 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.410
 in our cupcake molds os 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.360
 I also recommend putting flour I do not 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.030
 I put and they stayed a little stuck what 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.550
 better to put both things well and now 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 take with a spoon to serve a 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.050
 you can pick up a dispenser 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.550
 ice cream balls whatever it takes to 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.680
 that the rations have more or less 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.270
 homogeneous so you do not put much more 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.430
 in one place than in another 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.960
 well then we distribute with the measure that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.230
 I have given you mass gives us to do 9 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.570
 we are going to throw and now we are going to put them 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.760
 in the oven as they are tiny for 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.800
 this mass with 20-25 minutes is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.140
 enough if you want a big cake 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 you will need 35 40 minutes 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.220
 good as it does not take yeast up a 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.100
 little but then it 's like going back to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.660
 get off well this is the pie dough 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.260
 de santiago I have not said it but it 's like that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.480
 I see if it's made with a knitting needle 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 in the center when it's done what 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 I do is with a knife I help given that 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.650
 he had not put flour and separated a little 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.810
 to be able to demold well once 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.520
 I have them demold you use a cutter 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.480
 You can click to see the video in the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.370
 that we make cutters with cans and before 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.200
 that the cutter puts him in goal 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.200
 down what I do is with the knife 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.140
 today a little bit the way because these cakes 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.000
 they have a crust or the almond makes 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.010
 like a small one it will cost hard and if not 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.519
 cut with the knife what I do is 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.300
 do rajas you see there has already opened 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.880
 a little bit good because nothing has already been removed 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.890
 in half now let's make a 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.220
 strawberry jam for those who want 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.440
 Fill with strawberry jelly 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.720
 I put some strawberries I made half a glass 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.090
 of water and I cook it also with 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.100
 a little sugar once you have the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.900
 jam what I will do is put 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.420
 gelatin for that I put a couple of leaves 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.860
 of gelatine in cold water so that it 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.950
 we lock could also hydrate having 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.540
 used in good dust because nothing now a 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.360
 Once this has made the syrup you see 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.970
 what I do is go through the minipimer and 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.580
 he joined sheets gelatin 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.100
 I had hydrating you see, I mix it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.110
 all in heat and leave a little to be 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.000
 temper to incorporate then some 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.980
 small strawberries that we are going to cut 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.140
 now I just have to cut a strawberry 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.330
 of course always washed the strawberries 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.940
 he cut the top part now the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.620
 cut into tiny pieces but before 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.480
 I'm going to take off the tip part of 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.690
 the strawberry that we will use later to decorate 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.240
 our pies is to the strawberries 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.290
 He cut that part and the rest cut it in 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.600
 little bits when my jelly from 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.640
 strawberry is tempered I add the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.340
 pieces not before because if you do not know 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.280
 they look good now I take a bowl that is 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.770
 the size of my cutter so then 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.290
 that for inside my cards and in that 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.300
 I put the gelatin I put you there 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.060
 gelatin and leave it in the fridge for 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.880
 about two hours until good 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.139
 Meanwhile we will continue to part 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.990
 that we have removed from the center of our 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.880
 tarts we removed the part of the crust 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.210
 the hard part to the top and the 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.830
 rest I pass it for icing sugar especially 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.900
 it is important to cover the sides well 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.880
 since when we later throw sugar 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.280
 on the outside it is not easy to cover those 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.500
 lateral good so let's see a 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 first way to fill in put the strawberry 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.030
 as you can see the pieces of strawberry 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.350
 inside and now it is already tampo with the 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.840
 top part and I put icing sugar 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220
 outside to decorate put the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.100
 tips of the strawberries we had 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.500
 said and if you want to decorate the plate 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.830
 we can also file a strawberry the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.100
 we cut and unfolded a little good that 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.120
 is the other way that we have said is 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.860
 with gelatin we have gelatin 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.389
 prepared with the same mold or cutter 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.940
 sorry we used to do the 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.650
 center we cut pieces and those are the 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.810
 we put into our 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.600
 cupcakes because of our cards 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.650
 just as before I sprinkle or I put 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.410
 the top part and sprinkle with 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.729
 icing sugar, good, I hope 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.250
 that you liked, you can also 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.289
 leave them without sugar glas you see which of 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.970
 you both seem more appetizing with or 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.710
 no good what you put sugar in 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.430
 comments see you in the next 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.430
