for a second for just a second game play
here<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.420> thought<00:00:46.320> Adams<00:00:46.770> fared<00:00:47.129> pretty<00:00:47.280> well

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
here I thought Adams fared pretty well

here I thought Adams fared pretty well
for<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> most<00:00:47.940> part<00:00:48.059> ii<00:00:48.680> didn't<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> ball

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
for the most part ii didn't get the ball

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
for the most part ii didn't get the ball
as<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.489> did<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.850> Monday<00:00:51.360> night<00:00:51.539> where

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
as much as he did on Monday night where

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
as much as he did on Monday night where
he<00:00:51.780> scored<00:00:52.100> 12<00:00:53.100> points<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.579> 15<00:00:53.910> rebounds<00:00:54.120> with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
he scored 12 points at 15 rebounds with

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
he scored 12 points at 15 rebounds with
the<00:00:54.480> eight<00:00:54.600> blocks<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.260> he<00:00:55.949> still<00:00:56.129> made<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the eight blocks but he still made a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.560 
the eight blocks but he still made a
pretty<00:00:56.489> significant<00:00:57.000> impact<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> game

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

when you agreed absolutely I think he

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
def he's like you said early he scored

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.579 
def he's like you said early he scored
10<00:01:01.379> points<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.270> been<00:01:03.409> since<00:01:04.409> his

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
10 points but as it has been since his

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109 
10 points but as it has been since his
first<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.280> he's<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.489> showed<00:01:05.970> his

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
first game here he's really showed his

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.670

impact<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> boards<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.140> seemed<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> just

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
impact on the boards he seemed to just

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640
