00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.059
 in the kitchen 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.910
 the grenade already takes you there in you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.820

 grenade old-fashioned grenade and and if you like 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.779
 about cuts because what maybe thinks 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.740

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.420

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 number one small berries 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710

 sommetje itself open in a neat way 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.140
 have suppressed in the kitchen than will 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.140
 I show you how to do that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 that is a fruit that you would like for a moment 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.289
 packed with vitamin C hands 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.879
 vitamins and minerals potassium and whole 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.579
 many antioxidants 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 it will be a rejuvenation fruit 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.430
 must 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.899
 many things would be good for the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.289
 other against racing problems 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.840
 Well let me show you how 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.199
 him grandma 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.199
 Submit 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.650
 yes i prefer to use it is 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.960
 in the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.140
 all around on it only the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 peel so that you do not do a lot of berries 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.080
 the direction across the axis of the flight 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 which is safe with an all-around open 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.810
 is then you go a little twist a little 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 foxes and then you see all those little ones 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 berries are still in that room 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 well we leave the boat but for the rest 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.939
 may have its own because there express 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.229
 of picking and I don't know that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.930
 then it becomes a big pan whatever you go 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.939
 doing a bit of this 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.860
 difference a bit too after we are now 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.869
 to do all the way up 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.869
 and then you go with a spatula 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.289
 take flight and what happens 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 then sees all those little 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.459
 fish 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.760
 still easy home after a few firm 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.000
 clapping is your nicknames live my 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000
 sparklab 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.630
 one sees he is empty and the big one 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.280
 advantage is that you get this stuff that again 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.630
 not having that looks almost now 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 a few 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.299
 flake name well there you still leave 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.250
 see the side part that is not 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.130
 is quite right 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.769
 how to get rid of them here too 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.010
 little bit too much 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.970
 little bit so loose around 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 slap nicely before sliding 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.629
 [Music] 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.669

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.609
 fresh berries that make you incredibly tasty 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.549
 can use for juice that is defeated before 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.989
 salary but also simply as a snack 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.010
 inbetween 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.459
 they are a beautiful frame here the richer 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.459
 to be 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.250
 and things that shoes are this me 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.440
