00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.869 

when<00:00:02.350> we<00:00:02.470> think<00:00:02.710> about<00:00:02.889> changes<00:00:03.370> that<00:00:03.550> happen

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:03.879 
when we think about changes that happen

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.610 
when we think about changes that happen
during<00:00:03.999> puberty<00:00:04.390> we<00:00:04.810> usually<00:00:05.200> think<00:00:05.380> about

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.620 
during puberty we usually think about

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.520 
during puberty we usually think about
changes<00:00:06.130> that<00:00:06.160> happen<00:00:06.670> to<00:00:06.700> the<00:00:06.940> body<00:00:07.530> things

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
changes that happen to the body things

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.140 
changes that happen to the body things
like<00:00:08.740> the<00:00:08.830> development<00:00:09.309> of<00:00:09.400> secondary<00:00:09.790> sex

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
like the development of secondary sex

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.329 
like the development of secondary sex
characteristics<00:00:10.990> or<00:00:11.169> changes<00:00:11.650> in<00:00:11.769> height<00:00:12.009> or

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:12.339 
characteristics or changes in height or

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.549 
characteristics or changes in height or
an<00:00:12.429> increase<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.879> body<00:00:13.089> hair<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:14.410> those

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
an increase in body hair but those

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.109 
an increase in body hair but those
aren't<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:14.919> only<00:00:15.009> changes<00:00:15.339> that<00:00:15.700> happen

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
aren't the only changes that happen

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.970 
aren't the only changes that happen
there<00:00:16.720> are<00:00:16.750> actually<00:00:17.080> a<00:00:17.109> lot<00:00:17.289> of<00:00:17.349> changes<00:00:17.830> that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
there are actually a lot of changes that

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.700 
there are actually a lot of changes that
happen<00:00:18.340> to<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.550> brain<00:00:18.760> as<00:00:18.910> well<00:00:18.939> I'm<00:00:19.650> sure<00:00:20.650> I

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
happen to the brain as well I'm sure I

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.320 
happen to the brain as well I'm sure I
have<00:00:20.949> an<00:00:21.039> image<00:00:21.250> of<00:00:21.429> a<00:00:21.550> brain<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.090> this<00:00:22.179> is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
have an image of a brain and this is

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.609 
have an image of a brain and this is
what<00:00:22.480> you<00:00:22.599> would<00:00:22.720> see<00:00:22.929> if<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.080> looked<00:00:23.349> at<00:00:23.439> the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
what you would see if you looked at the

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.759 
what you would see if you looked at the
side<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.369> brain<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:26.050> here<00:00:26.289> is<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.560> front

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
side of the brain so here is the front

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.720 
side of the brain so here is the front
towards<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.460> face<00:00:27.810> here's<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.019> back<00:00:29.230> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
towards the face here's the back and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.130 
towards the face here's the back and
then<00:00:30.730> over<00:00:30.939> here<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.179> have<00:00:31.359> another<00:00:31.390> brain<00:00:31.929> and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
then over here I have another brain and

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.869 
then over here I have another brain and
this<00:00:32.230> brain<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:32.619> sliced<00:00:32.920> in<00:00:33.190> half<00:00:33.219> so<00:00:33.760> the

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
this brain is sliced in half so the

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.400 
this brain is sliced in half so the
spring<00:00:34.120> is<00:00:34.239> sliced<00:00:34.570> right<00:00:34.989> down<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.379> middle

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
spring is sliced right down the middle

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.770 
spring is sliced right down the middle
and<00:00:35.860> these<00:00:36.550> two<00:00:36.730> brains<00:00:37.000> are<00:00:37.120> facing<00:00:37.690> each

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
and these two brains are facing each

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.380 
and these two brains are facing each
other<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.379> here's<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.860> front<00:00:39.129> and<00:00:39.489> then

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
other so here's the front and then

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.740 
other so here's the front and then
here's<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.750> back<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.260> this<00:00:41.379> one<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:43.660> of

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
here's the back of this one and one of

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.119 
here's the back of this one and one of
the<00:00:43.840> major<00:00:44.050> changes<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.680> we<00:00:44.770> see<00:00:44.980> during

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
the major changes that we see during

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.799 
the major changes that we see during
adolescence<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.149> development<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.690> the

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
adolescence is the development of the

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.810 
adolescence is the development of the
frontal<00:00:47.140> lobe<00:00:47.199> particularly<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.340> prefrontal

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
frontal lobe particularly the prefrontal

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.200 
frontal lobe particularly the prefrontal
cortex<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:50.070> I'll<00:00:51.070> roughly<00:00:51.460> indicate<00:00:51.879> where

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
cortex and I'll roughly indicate where

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.069 
cortex and I'll roughly indicate where
on<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.449> brain<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:55.809> the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
on the brain that is and this is the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.810 
on the brain that is and this is the
area<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.559> brain<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:56.769> is<00:00:56.980> responsible

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
area of the brain that is responsible

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.569 
area of the brain that is responsible
for<00:00:57.850> what<00:00:58.180> scientists<00:00:58.719> call<00:00:58.989> higher-order

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for what scientists call higher-order

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.150 
for what scientists call higher-order
cognition<00:01:00.960> things<00:01:01.960> like<00:01:02.170> thinking<00:01:02.800> about<00:01:03.039> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
cognition things like thinking about the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.890 
cognition things like thinking about the
future<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.609> planning<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.510> decision-making

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
future and planning and decision-making

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.499 
future and planning and decision-making
and<00:01:05.350> also<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.400> ability<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.820> inhibit<00:01:07.180> certain

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
and also the ability to inhibit certain

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.539 
and also the ability to inhibit certain
behaviors<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.409> focus<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.860> long<00:01:09.040> term<00:01:09.310> goals

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
behaviors and focus on long term goals

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.450 
behaviors and focus on long term goals
and<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.470> part<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:11.920> brain<00:01:12.040> doesn't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
and this part of the brain doesn't

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.490 
and this part of the brain doesn't
really<00:01:12.580> stop<00:01:12.909> maturing<00:01:13.450> until<00:01:13.780> our<00:01:13.900> early<00:01:14.110> 20s

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
really stop maturing until our early 20s

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.319 
really stop maturing until our early 20s
and<00:01:14.710> because<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.909> still<00:01:16.090> developing

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
and because it is still developing

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.179 
and because it is still developing
during<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.869> teenage<00:01:17.259> years<00:01:17.290> because<00:01:17.829> it

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
during the teenage years because it

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.370 
during the teenage years because it
isn't<00:01:18.400> fully<00:01:18.610> developed<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.750> might<00:01:20.020> help<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
isn't fully developed this might help to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.230 
isn't fully developed this might help to
explain<00:01:20.409> why<00:01:20.770> teenagers<00:01:21.369> sometimes<00:01:22.060> show

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
explain why teenagers sometimes show

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.950 
explain why teenagers sometimes show
poor<00:01:22.509> judgment<00:01:24.119> another<00:01:25.119> area<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.689> brain

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
poor judgment another area of the brain

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.270 
poor judgment another area of the brain
that<00:01:26.079> continues<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.710> develop<00:01:26.950> during

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
that continues to develop during

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.850 
that continues to develop during
adolescence<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.420> limbic<00:01:28.659> system<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
adolescence is the limbic system and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.350 
adolescence is the limbic system and
this<00:01:30.040> includes<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.579> number<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.030> different

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
this includes a number of different

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.260 
this includes a number of different
brain<00:01:31.540> structures<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.729> image<00:01:34.000> isn't

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
brain structures and this image isn't

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.819 
brain structures and this image isn't
really<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.600> best<00:01:34.810> way<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.079> view<00:01:35.320> them<00:01:35.530> because

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
really the best way to view them because

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.859 
really the best way to view them because
a<00:01:35.860> lot<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.310> structures<00:01:36.790> are<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.630> either

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
a lot of the structures are on either

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.530 
a lot of the structures are on either
side<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.740> midline<00:01:38.970> even<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.210> want<00:01:40.479> to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
side of the midline even so I want to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.179 
side of the midline even so I want to
point<00:01:40.750> out<00:01:40.899> about<00:01:41.380> where<00:01:41.680> they<00:01:41.829> are<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
point out about where they are in the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.120 
point out about where they are in the
brain<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:44.110> structure<00:01:44.560> included<00:01:44.979> in<00:01:45.040> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
brain and one structure included in the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.249 
brain and one structure included in the
limbic<00:01:45.399> system<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.030> amygdala<00:01:46.570> which

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
limbic system is the amygdala which

my eyes when teenagers act out this does

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.640 
my eyes when teenagers act out this does
actually<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.720> some<00:02:54.960> really<00:02:55.230> important

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
we should be able to charge teenagers

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.760 
we should be able to charge teenagers
like<00:03:00.630> adults<00:03:01.080> when<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.290> commit<00:03:01.620> certain

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
crimes and this is a question that I put

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.030 
crimes and this is a question that I put
to<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.840> show<00:03:06.840> teenagers<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.830> same

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
to you show teenagers get the same

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.680 
to you show teenagers get the same
treatment<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.550> adults<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.270> commit<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
treatment as adults if they commit the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.170 
treatment as adults if they commit the
same<00:03:09.870> crimes<00:03:10.310> should<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.490> be<00:03:11.640> able<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.060> be

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
same crimes should they be able to be

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
same crimes should they be able to be
sentenced<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> death<00:03:13.020> or<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.590> life<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:13.920> prison

for acts that they commit prior to
turning<00:03:16.200> 18<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.240> think<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.960> a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
turning 18 do you think that this is a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.040 
turning 18 do you think that this is a
good<00:03:19.200> boundary<00:03:19.710> our<00:03:20.330> crimes<00:03:21.330> committed<00:03:21.810> one

another<00:03:48.870> area<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.410> brain<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.800> changes

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
another area of the brain that changes

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.770 
another area of the brain that changes
during<00:03:50.460> adolescence<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.390> corpus

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
during adolescence is the corpus

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.070 
during adolescence is the corpus
callosum<00:03:52.170> which<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:53.010> see<00:03:53.190> here<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:54.080> this

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
callosum which you can see here and this

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.810 
callosum which you can see here and this
is<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.380> area<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.920> brain<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.190> connects

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
is the area of the brain that connects

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.080 
is the area of the brain that connects
our<00:03:57.030> left<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.600> right<00:03:57.810> hemispheres<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.090> there

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
our left and right hemispheres and there

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.640 
our left and right hemispheres and there
are<00:04:00.210> a<00:04:00.270> number<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.570> things<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.020> change<00:04:01.410> about

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
are a number of things that change about

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.400 
are a number of things that change about
the<00:04:01.800> structure<00:04:02.220> during<00:04:02.400> adolescence<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:04.230> in

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
the structure during adolescence but in

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.230 
the structure during adolescence but in
particular<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.400> want<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.700> focus<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
particular I really want to focus on the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.730 
particular I really want to focus on the
changes<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.750> connections<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.620> are

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
changes to connections that are

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.770 
changes to connections that are
associated<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.430> language<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.300> language

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
associated with language and language

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.320 
associated with language and language
learning<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.430> these<00:04:11.430> connections<00:04:12.030> grow

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
learning and these connections grow

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.480 
learning and these connections grow
before<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:12.990> during<00:04:13.140> puberty<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:14.310> this

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
before and during puberty but this

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.300 
before and during puberty but this
growth<00:04:14.790> stops<00:04:15.270> soon<00:04:15.720> afterwards<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.560> this

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
growth stops soon afterwards and this

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.979 
growth stops soon afterwards and this
might<00:04:17.549> help<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> explain<00:04:18.270> why<00:04:18.390> learning<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
might help to explain why learning a

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.930 
might help to explain why learning a
second<00:04:19.290> language<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.040> much<00:04:20.280> easier<00:04:20.549> in

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
second language is so much easier in

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.070 
second language is so much easier in
childhood<00:04:21.450> as<00:04:21.690> compared<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.169> adulthood<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.930> we

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
childhood as compared to adulthood so we

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.260 
childhood as compared to adulthood so we
see<00:04:25.230> changes<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:25.980> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
see changes to this the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.330 
see changes to this the
cific<00:04:26.539> brain<00:04:26.720> areas<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:27.919> there<00:04:28.099> are<00:04:28.190> also

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
helps to increase the speed at which the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.610 
helps to increase the speed at which the

and<00:05:08.080> this<00:05:09.080> can<00:05:09.289> help<00:05:09.409> explain<00:05:09.770> why

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
and this can help explain why

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.439 
and this can help explain why
adolescents<00:05:10.729> are<00:05:10.849> able<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.120> process

information faster than children another
thing<00:05:16.159> that<00:05:16.310> we<00:05:16.400> see<00:05:16.550> during<00:05:16.729> this<00:05:16.970> time

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
thing that we see during this time

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.850 
thing that we see during this time
period<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.810> that<00:05:17.900> there's<00:05:18.110> an<00:05:18.259> increase<00:05:18.680> in

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
period is that there's an increase in

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.770 
period is that there's an increase in
brain<00:05:19.039> volume<00:05:19.099> during<00:05:19.819> early<00:05:20.210> adolescence

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
brain volume during early adolescence

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.990 
brain volume during early adolescence
and<00:05:21.050> then<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.949> shrinks<00:05:22.520> during<00:05:22.789> late

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
and then the shrinks during late

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.869 
and then the shrinks during late
adolescence<00:05:23.599> and<00:05:24.219> this<00:05:25.219> suggests<00:05:25.430> that

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
adolescence and this suggests that

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.580 
adolescence and this suggests that
adolescence<00:05:26.449> is<00:05:26.599> a<00:05:26.629> period<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.169> synaptic

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
adolescence is a period of synaptic

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.700 
adolescence is a period of synaptic
pruning<00:05:28.270> or<00:05:29.270> cutting<00:05:29.780> weak<00:05:29.960> connections<00:05:30.560> in

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
pruning or cutting weak connections in

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.240 
pruning or cutting weak connections in
the<00:05:30.800> brain<00:05:31.810> so<00:05:32.810> this<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.169> your<00:05:33.319> body<00:05:33.530> literally

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
the brain so this is your body literally

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.890 
the brain so this is your body literally
breaking<00:05:34.580> down<00:05:34.940> connections<00:05:35.630> between

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
breaking down connections between

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.550 
breaking down connections between
neurons<00:05:36.319> and<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:38.750> might<00:05:38.930> initially<00:05:39.139> think

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
neurons and you might initially think

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.709 
neurons and you might initially think
that<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.949> a<00:05:39.979> bad<00:05:40.280> thing<00:05:40.610> but<00:05:41.569> this

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
that this is a bad thing but this

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.600 
that this is a bad thing but this
pruning<00:05:42.199> is<00:05:42.319> actually<00:05:42.800> really<00:05:42.979> good<00:05:43.279> and<00:05:43.340> it's

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
pruning is actually really good and it's

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.999 
pruning is actually really good and it's
really<00:05:43.940> important<00:05:44.419> because<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.529> allows<00:05:45.770> the

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
really important because it allows the

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.189 
really important because it allows the
body<00:05:46.099> to<00:05:46.250> focus<00:05:46.759> energy<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.419> resources<00:05:47.990> on

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199

the connections that are used most and a

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.399 
the connections that are used most and a
kind<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.580> scary<00:05:53.029> implication<00:05:53.840> of<00:05:53.900> this<00:05:54.080> is

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
kind of scary implication of this is

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.830 
kind of scary implication of this is
that<00:05:55.219> what<00:05:55.490> we<00:05:55.520> do<00:05:55.789> during<00:05:56.029> our<00:05:56.210> teenagers

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
that what we do during our teenagers

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.140 
that what we do during our teenagers
might<00:05:57.469> be<00:05:57.680> literally<00:05:58.190> shaping<00:05:58.729> our<00:05:58.849> brains

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
might be literally shaping our brains

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.870 
might be literally shaping our brains
for<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.539> rest<00:05:59.750> of<00:05:59.870> our<00:05:59.960> lives<00:06:00.699> but<00:06:01.699> there's

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
for the rest of our lives but there's

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.209 
for the rest of our lives but there's
kind<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.270> a<00:06:02.389> use-it-or-lose-it<00:06:03.130> principle<00:06:04.130> at

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
kind of a use-it-or-lose-it principle at

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.879 
kind of a use-it-or-lose-it principle at
work<00:06:04.370> here<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.810> if<00:06:05.930> we<00:06:06.080> spend<00:06:06.380> our<00:06:06.500> free<00:06:06.650> time

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889

academics and having good time
management<00:06:11.389> skills<00:06:11.960> then<00:06:12.770> that's<00:06:12.979> what's

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
management skills then that's what's

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.459 
management skills then that's what's
going<00:06:13.460> to<00:06:13.490> be<00:06:13.669> reinforced<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.930> parts<00:06:15.289> of<00:06:15.380> the

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
going to be reinforced the parts of the

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:16.930 
going to be reinforced the parts of the

behaviors are physically going to be

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.939 
behaviors are physically going to be
strengthened<00:06:19.900> but<00:06:20.900> if<00:06:21.020> we<00:06:21.169> spend<00:06:21.469> most<00:06:21.680> of<00:06:21.860> our

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
strengthened but if we spend most of our
