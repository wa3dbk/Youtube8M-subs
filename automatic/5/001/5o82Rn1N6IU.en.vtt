00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.759
 I'm going with the measure of this watch here 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.400
 As I said, they change the points and 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.890
 we are not going to see the coil that we saw here 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.310
 before 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.640
 I correct 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:21.170
 that you notice here a point other not in 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.660
 this our coil points are 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.740
 here to be represented not on this but on 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 these tracks 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.529
 this is untouchable because here are the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.489
 the filaments then I will do what 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.800
 same one point to each other point here 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.170
 we can the reaction 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 in the third and we'll see how 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 this circuit reacts unlike the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.490
 previous 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.350
 with the touches 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.980
 indistinctly the position of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.980
 same look 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 between positions 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.489
 as more stable goes up as much as low 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.269
 let's go to the second 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.269
 test 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 first the hollow and then the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.700
 explained 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 the next test 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.869
 as in the previous case the second one 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 we did the negative to one of the two 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.460
 tracks of the coil output and the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.390
 positive to the stack let's see 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 relate that needle 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.330
 I go to one of the tracks already on the stack 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 there we have it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 now I change 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.260
 of track 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.740
 the relationship is the same and I go to the 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.159
 last test where he placed the pile on 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.890
 the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.620
 the metal part of the watch 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.370
 I make contact with her and I go to 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.370
 positive 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.800
 Tika explained it quickly 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.510
 upside down negative and positive here in this 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.010
 look at it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.010
 I'm going to put each part 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.550
 if you see the feeling of this circuit is 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.610
 more couple 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.480
 that we worked previously 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.050
 very clear 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.110
 With this we finish your work 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.030
 electronic watches I remember my 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.940
 decision to 969 hotmail.com I thank you 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.280
 have seen this video 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.920
 and any questions or suggestions make me 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.460
 the favor that they communicate it to my mail 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.460
 I hope you liked it
