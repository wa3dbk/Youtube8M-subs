first<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.220> all<00:00:37.280> HJC<00:00:37.730> has<00:00:38.090> made<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.300> much<00:00:38.660> lower

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
first of all HJC has made a much lower

profile helmet it also sits a lot lower
on<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.080> head<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:42.530> it's<00:00:42.739> not<00:00:42.860> going<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.070> give

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
ride with the communication system so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.280 
ride with the communication system so
you<00:01:08.060> won't<00:01:08.210> have<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.420> have<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.660> underneath<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
you won't have to have it underneath the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.080 
you won't have to have it underneath the
ear<00:01:09.440> flaps<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.430> has<00:01:10.580> something<00:01:10.940> that's

really<00:01:11.479> cool<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.720> really<00:01:12.290> unique<00:01:12.560> feature<00:01:13.040> that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
really cool a really unique feature that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.999 
really cool a really unique feature that
HJC<00:01:14.360> has<00:01:14.750> added<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.350> helmet<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.830> has<00:01:15.979> a

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
HJC has added to this helmet it has a

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.520 
HJC has added to this helmet it has a
ratcheting<00:01:16.700> tightening<00:01:17.330> device<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:18.289> is<00:01:18.500> a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
ratcheting tightening device this is a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.650 
ratcheting tightening device this is a
really<00:01:19.100> really<00:01:19.399> cool<00:01:19.580> feature<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.360> know

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
really really cool feature you know

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.270 
really really cool feature you know
typically<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.110> prefer<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.680> ride<00:01:21.830> with<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.039> full

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
typically I prefer to ride with a full

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.100 
typically I prefer to ride with a full
face<00:01:22.490> helmet<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.180> understand<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:23.840> half

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
face helmet but I understand that half

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.020 
face helmet but I understand that half
helmets<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.649> move<00:01:24.920> around<00:01:25.190> quite<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.670> bit<00:01:25.759> on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
helmets can move around quite a bit on

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.550 
helmets can move around quite a bit on
the<00:01:26.149> freeway<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.960> think<00:01:27.200> that's<00:01:27.350> part<00:01:27.530> of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the freeway and I think that's part of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.690 
the freeway and I think that's part of
the<00:01:27.619> reason<00:01:27.830> why<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:27.979> like<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.340> full<00:01:28.490> face

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the reason why I like the full face

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.490 
the reason why I like the full face
helmet<00:01:29.000> because<00:01:29.209> it<00:01:29.330> stays<00:01:29.539> put<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.380> is

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
helmet because it stays put but this is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.109 
helmet because it stays put but this is
going<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.709> help<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:31.039> lot<00:01:31.190> because<00:01:31.429> this

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
going to help a lot because this

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.680 
going to help a lot because this
tightening<00:01:32.660> device<00:01:32.990> actually<00:01:34.390> ratchets<00:01:35.390> in

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
tightening device actually ratchets in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.779 
tightening device actually ratchets in
so<00:01:35.959> it<00:01:36.110> pulls<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.679> back<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> helmet<00:01:37.640> in

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
so it pulls the back of the helmet in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.540 
so it pulls the back of the helmet in
tighter<00:01:38.060> but<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.330> also<00:01:38.569> pulls<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.349> whole<00:01:39.649> area

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
tighter but it also pulls the whole area

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.490 
tighter but it also pulls the whole area
