00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.420
 is actually assembled it seems not me 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.420
 It looks like a teddy 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.170
 or some kind of trick that did what 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.920
 he did well 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.630

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.240
 use of chlorine is that making the delta 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.400
 the guy walks down the street with the parrot and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.320
 the black follows him 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.689
 help you believe it by riding a motorcycle 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.619
 I do not know what we're saying here 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.619
 it looks like trucho 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.350
 that one is back there walking in the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.300
 motorcycle with this the northwest is real or not 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.120
 good we send people our tucumÃ¡n 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.960
 correspondents there in the north do the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 note to see what 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.150
 of this I had it in a cage this 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.850
 at the beginning with short wings after 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.800
 at the time I let her wings grow when 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 they grew it and well if it's going to be 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.220
 go but I wanted to know if he stayed 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 and in fact it stayed the same it is going to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.310
 notice this that I suddenly got on the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.190
 motorcycles and followed me then good up 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.460
 where I went for a walk around the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 villa where he was walking and he follows me here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.180
 what has happened and this good questions 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 he started to try heads and he's like 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 if it were a dog as is 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.790
 goes out to travel with the bike to a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.920
 determined speed and the mexiquense is 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.350
 tested at the speed that goes perfect 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.230
 40 kilometers and there goes resting 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.780
 can fly a lot up to 80 comes 60 goes 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.220
 a bit demanded but the bat change 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.350
 the head as you have seen it is 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.330
 awesome awesome and it's a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.890
 jealous of the way you call them what 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.890
 hugged someone chau is coming 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.580
 because if not embraced the bike to 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.580
 you won the crime 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.700
 to people looking at your impressions and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.550
 I started, I do not care if it's all a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.010
 thing that is not normal does not exist this by 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.620
 at least I do not ever need then 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.420
 it's awesome and sitting on the bike 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.670
 with him flying, touching me with his wings 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.260
 face and looking at me because it's going 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.120
 talking to why I also 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.799
 I talk like that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.799
 it's really impressive 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.950
 it is said that it seems person is not person 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.950
 but there just for better 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.240
 it is not observed 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.520
 this image was amazing to me 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.860
 but this happens is a relationship 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.290
 important because he was the owner of the gold 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.060
 so loving so nice the man who 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.040
 go on a motorcycle says let's talk 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.700
 that you have to remember what they say about the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.700
 reason 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:27.520
 good for it to look like it was the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.180
 he talks he does not see it amazing to me 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.180
 believe
