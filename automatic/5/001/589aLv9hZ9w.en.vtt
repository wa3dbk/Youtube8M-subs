had they all have the same resolution

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010 
had they all have the same resolution
but<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> color<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> 920<00:01:06.630> looked<00:01:06.900> a

but the color is on the 920 looked a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
little bit better to me on the 928 and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
little bit better to me on the 928 and
the<00:01:09.810> 1020<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.740> Emaline<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> still

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the 1020 there Emaline there is still

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750 
the 1020 there Emaline there is still
good<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.570> they're<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.560> quite<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> same<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
good but they're not quite the same and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
good but they're not quite the same and
they're<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.270> color<00:01:15.869> accurate<00:01:16.350> sometimes

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
they're not as color accurate sometimes

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
they're not as color accurate sometimes
that<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.460> seem<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.820> off<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> little

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that might seem a little off or a little

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
that might seem a little off or a little
darker<00:01:19.049> than<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.380> should<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.770> tone<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
darker than they should in tone but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
darker than they should in tone but
still<00:01:20.790> their<00:01:21.119> quality<00:01:21.630> displays<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.619> high

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
still their quality displays with high

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
still their quality displays with high
resolutions<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.240> terms<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.659> screen<00:01:25.049> I'd

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
resolutions so in terms of screen I'd

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370 
resolutions so in terms of screen I'd
say<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> 920<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.509> best<00:01:27.720> screen<00:01:28.110> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
say that the 920 is the best screen so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
say that the 920 is the best screen so
if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> best

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
if you have that you have the best

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
if you have that you have the best
screen<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> moment<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> Lumia

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
screen at the moment of the Lumia

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.740 
screen at the moment of the Lumia
devices<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.820> difference<00:01:33.180> between<00:01:33.570> them

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
devices but the difference between them

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
devices but the difference between them
is<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.140> bad<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.670> points<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is not so bad that I take points off for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.870 
is not so bad that I take points off for
the<00:01:36.930> 1020<00:01:37.470> I'd<00:01:37.680> still<00:01:37.979> say<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.640> more

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the 1020 I'd still say that this is more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
the 1020 I'd still say that this is more
than<00:01:39.090> capable<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.720> being<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.380> screen<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
than capable of being a good screen for

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.850 
than capable of being a good screen for
you<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.400> Lumia<00:01:41.790> 920<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.420> 928<00:01:43.380> tend<00:01:43.740> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you the Lumia 920 and 928 tend to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
you the Lumia 920 and 928 tend to
deliver<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> similar<00:01:44.670> performance<00:01:44.880> because

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
deliver a similar performance because

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
deliver a similar performance because
they<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.140> amount<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.530> RAM<00:01:46.740> the

gigabytes<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.680> mainly<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
gigabytes but that's mainly because of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
gigabytes but that's mainly because of
the<00:01:53.790> camera<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.509> needed<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> allocate<00:01:55.500> more

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the camera they needed to allocate more

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
the camera they needed to allocate more

they're<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:03.119> marginal<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.860> slight

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
they're very marginal it's a slight

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

notice<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:11.220> gonna<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.760> very

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
notice it because it's gonna be very

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.880 
notice it because it's gonna be very
small<00:02:12.180> different

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
small different

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.380 
small different
between<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.310> two<00:02:13.460> because<00:02:13.610> remember<00:02:13.850> Windows

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

Phone<00:02:14.630> 8<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:15.080> pretty<00:02:15.380> fast<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.800> begin<00:02:15.920> with

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
Phone 8 was pretty fast to begin with

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.520 
Phone 8 was pretty fast to begin with
pretty<00:02:16.730> much<00:02:16.910> lag<00:02:17.180> free<00:02:17.569> there's<00:02:18.080> some<00:02:18.319> apps

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
pretty much lag free there's some apps

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.530 
pretty much lag free there's some apps
that<00:02:18.709> take<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.280> long<00:02:19.490> time<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.270> give<00:02:20.450> you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
that take a long time then they give you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.120 
that take a long time then they give you
that<00:02:20.660> molding<00:02:20.990> screen<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.440> awhile<00:02:21.530> but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
that molding screen for awhile but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
that molding screen for awhile but
otherwise<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:23.000> should<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.390> performance

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
otherwise you should get performance

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.260 
otherwise you should get performance
from<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.680> decent<00:02:24.950> performance<00:02:25.520> from<00:02:25.880> any<00:02:26.090> of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
from a decent performance from any of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.180 
from a decent performance from any of
these<00:02:26.360> devices<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.170> that's<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.830> really<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
these devices so that's not really a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.730 
these devices so that's not really a
reason<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.880> upgrade<00:02:29.060> some<00:02:30.050> people<00:02:30.350> may<00:02:30.500> choose

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
reason to upgrade some people may choose

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.230 
reason to upgrade some people may choose
not<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:31.190> upgrade<00:02:31.550> at<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:31.820> because<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
not to upgrade at all because you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.790 
not to upgrade at all because you
actually<00:02:32.390> lose<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> couple<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.410> things<00:02:33.620> when

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
actually lose a couple of things when

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.830 
actually lose a couple of things when
you<00:02:33.920> switch<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.430> 1020<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.510> instance

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you switch to a 1020 for instance

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.540 
you switch to a 1020 for instance
wireless<00:02:36.260> charging<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.220> do<00:02:37.370> them

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
wireless charging you can do them

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.820 
wireless charging you can do them
natively<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.270> either<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.750> these<00:02:38.870> devices<00:02:39.410> but

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
natively on either of these devices but

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.460 
natively on either of these devices but
not<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.550> 1020<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.480> actually<00:02:41.840> need<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.080> put<00:02:42.440> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
not on a 1020 you actually need to put a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.229 
not on a 1020 you actually need to put a
latch<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:43.040> Kate<00:02:43.370> which<00:02:43.610> kind<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:43.910> defeats<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
latch on Kate which kind of defeats the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.360 
latch on Kate which kind of defeats the
purpose<00:02:44.390> because<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.320> can<00:02:45.470> tell<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.190> is

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
purpose because as you can tell this is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.610 
purpose because as you can tell this is
a<00:02:46.400> formidable<00:02:46.760> phone<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.510> its<00:02:47.780> own<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.200> adding

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
a formidable phone on its own so adding

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.800 
a formidable phone on its own so adding
to<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.830> thickness<00:02:49.070> isn't<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> best<00:02:50.180> idea<00:02:50.360> in

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to the thickness isn't the best idea in

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.810 
to the thickness isn't the best idea in
the<00:02:50.930> world<00:02:50.959> another<00:02:51.830> thing<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.160> consider<00:02:52.340> is

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the world another thing to consider is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.120 
the world another thing to consider is
that<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> speaker<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.750> only<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.290> one<00:02:54.769> side<00:02:55.100> of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
that the speaker is only on one side of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.640 
that the speaker is only on one side of
the<00:02:55.550> device<00:02:55.820> here<00:02:56.120> because<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.720> USB<00:02:57.050> port

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the device here because of the USB port

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770 
the device here because of the USB port
right<00:02:57.709> here<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.940> actually<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.570> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
right here and you actually have a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.160 
right here and you actually have a
little<00:03:00.260> grip<00:03:00.500> section<00:03:00.739> for<00:03:01.190> Alesso<00:03:01.790> or<00:03:02.000> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
little grip section for Alesso or a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.930 
little grip section for Alesso or a
separately<00:03:03.170> sold<00:03:03.440> camera<00:03:03.920> grip<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.640> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
separately sold camera grip you have to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.250 
separately sold camera grip you have to
have<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.330> space<00:03:05.570> right<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.200> don't

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
have this space right here so you don't

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.259 
have this space right here so you don't
have<00:03:06.560> speakers<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:07.190> both<00:03:07.220> sides<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
have speakers on both sides of the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.479 
have speakers on both sides of the
device<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.350> something<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.769> do<00:03:09.980> get<00:03:10.280> on

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
device that is something you do get on

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.910 
device that is something you do get on
the<00:03:10.550> 920<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.570> that's<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.900> fan<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.350> reason<00:03:12.830> that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the 920 so that's a fan a reason that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920 
the 920 so that's a fan a reason that
you<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.340> 920<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:14.030> might<00:03:14.360> be<00:03:14.510> cause<00:03:14.900> for

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
you like the 920 it might be cause for

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.069 
you like the 920 it might be cause for
you<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.470> not<00:03:15.769> want<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.130> upgrade<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.540> 928

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
you to not want to upgrade on the 928

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.509 
you to not want to upgrade on the 928
it's<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.380> an<00:03:18.470> issue<00:03:18.650> because<00:03:18.980> they<00:03:19.250> put<00:03:19.400> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
it's not an issue because they put the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.220 
it's not an issue because they put the
speaker<00:03:19.850> in<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.030> back<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.600> I'm<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
speaker in the back but I'm not really a

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.740 
speaker in the back but I'm not really a
fan<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.680> 928<00:03:22.250> speakers<00:03:22.640> sound<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.450> that's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
fan of the 928 speakers sound so that's

overall design of the 928 to begin with
it's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.910> little<00:03:32.150> squarer<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.750> little<00:03:33.110> more<00:03:33.260> boxy

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
it's a little squarer a little more boxy

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.670 
it's a little squarer a little more boxy
than<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.190> get<00:03:34.430> with<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:35.120> 920<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.110> 1020

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
with the 1020 you get something that's a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.080 
with the 1020 you get something that's a
little<00:03:47.360> bit<00:03:47.930> curvier<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> little<00:03:49.820> chunky

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
little bit curvier it is a little chunky

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.610 
little bit curvier it is a little chunky
at<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.269> top<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.690> don't<00:03:51.019> get<00:03:51.200> me<00:03:51.320> wrong<00:03:51.350> about

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
at the top and don't get me wrong about

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.500 
at the top and don't get me wrong about
that<00:03:51.860> because<00:03:52.070> it's<00:03:52.400> big<00:03:52.549> camera<00:03:52.880> housing<00:03:53.239> it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that because it's big camera housing it

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.210 
that because it's big camera housing it
affects<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> way<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.110> hold<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.470> device<00:03:54.769> you

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
affects the way you hold the device you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.130 
affects the way you hold the device you
might<00:03:55.370> have<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.700> cup<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> just<00:03:56.510> really<00:03:56.690> but

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
might have to cup it just really but

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.170 
might have to cup it just really but
just<00:03:57.500> below<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.010> camera<00:03:58.280> housing<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:59.030> might

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
just below the camera housing you might

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.300 
just below the camera housing you might
have<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.420> arc<00:03:59.660> your<00:03:59.810> finger<00:04:00.140> over<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.560> top<00:04:00.590> now

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
have to arc your finger over the top now

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.620 
have to arc your finger over the top now
this<00:04:01.489> is<00:04:01.640> something<00:04:01.820> I've<00:04:02.060> gotten<00:04:02.360> used<00:04:02.540> to

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
this is something I've gotten used to

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.110 
this is something I've gotten used to
over<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.170> past<00:04:03.590> couple<00:04:04.070> of<00:04:04.310> weeks<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.000> it's

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
over the past couple of weeks so it's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240 
over the past couple of weeks so it's
not<00:04:05.239> an<00:04:05.450> issue<00:04:05.660> for<00:04:05.840> me<00:04:06.110> but<00:04:06.500> overall<00:04:06.799> I'd<00:04:07.190> say

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
not an issue for me but overall I'd say

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.449 
not an issue for me but overall I'd say
that<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.000> 920<00:04:08.630> has<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.170> best<00:04:09.410> overall<00:04:10.010> design

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
that the 920 has the best overall design

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.250 
that the 920 has the best overall design
because<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.269> more<00:04:11.510> comfortable<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.989> hold

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
because it's more comfortable to hold

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.860 
because it's more comfortable to hold
its<00:04:12.799> curves<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.579> little<00:04:13.760> more<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:14.570> more<00:04:14.720> a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
its curves a little more so it's more a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.610 
its curves a little more so it's more a
hand<00:04:15.230> friendly<00:04:15.970> obviously<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.510> 1020<00:04:18.289> has<00:04:18.440> a

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
hand friendly obviously the 1020 has a

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.860 
hand friendly obviously the 1020 has a
similar<00:04:19.070> shape<00:04:19.310> but<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.209> camera<00:04:20.510> housing

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
similar shape but the camera housing

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.990 
similar shape but the camera housing
makes<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.169> big<00:04:21.410> difference<00:04:21.799> in<00:04:22.010> terms<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
makes a big difference in terms of the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.030 
makes a big difference in terms of the
way<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.450> phone<00:04:23.630> feels<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.200> your<00:04:24.349> hand

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
way that the phone feels in your hand

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
it does make a big difference in other

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.240 
it does make a big difference in other
aspects<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.600> overall<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.440> like<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.800> xenon

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
aspects so overall I like the xenon

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.720 
aspects so overall I like the xenon

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
flash that you get now with the 1020 you

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.930 
flash that you get now with the 1020 you
get<00:05:10.880> xenon<00:05:11.300> flash<00:05:11.680> for<00:05:12.680> photos<00:05:13.370> as<00:05:13.550> well<00:05:13.670> and

you get LED flash for video and video
and<00:05:17.240> photos<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.810> where<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.260> really<00:05:18.770> sets<00:05:19.010> it

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
and photos is where this really sets it

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.310 
and photos is where this really sets it
apart<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:20.060> just<00:05:20.300> it's<00:05:20.510> not<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:20.690> about<00:05:21.020> that

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
apart it just it's not just about that

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.350 
apart it just it's not just about that
it<00:05:21.470> has<00:05:21.620> 41<00:05:22.160> megapixels<00:05:22.730> because<00:05:23.150> remember

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
it has 41 megapixels because remember

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.420 
it has 41 megapixels because remember
it's<00:05:23.660> using<00:05:23.960> oversampling<00:05:24.650> it's<00:05:24.860> not<00:05:25.010> just

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
it's using oversampling it's not just

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.090 
it's using oversampling it's not just
taking<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:25.760> giant<00:05:25.970> picture<00:05:26.420> all<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.410> time<00:05:27.650> the

and it'll be easy to share it'll be

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.630 
and it'll be easy to share it'll be
about<00:05:35.420> 5<00:05:35.660> megapixels<00:05:36.350> you<00:05:36.830> can<00:05:36.980> see<00:05:37.220> from<00:05:37.490> the

about 5 megapixels you can see from the
quality<00:05:38.060> when<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.330> compare<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.900> three

devices that the 1020 has the best
camera<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.590> bunch<00:05:42.830> it's<00:05:43.100> pretty<00:05:43.550> obvious

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
camera of the bunch it's pretty obvious

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.460 
camera of the bunch it's pretty obvious

ability to listen to FM radio now that's
obviously<00:05:51.920> a<00:05:52.310> big<00:05:52.670> plus<00:05:52.970> but<00:05:53.450> it's<00:05:53.600> something

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
obviously a big plus but it's something

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.480 
obviously a big plus but it's something
that<00:05:54.050> you'll<00:05:54.230> get<00:05:54.380> on<00:05:54.620> previous<00:05:55.040> versions

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490

can be said of the pro camera which

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.570 
can be said of the pro camera which
really<00:06:00.230> makes<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:00.560> difference<00:06:00.590> in<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.220> type<00:06:01.370> of

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
really makes a difference in the type of

really makes a difference in the type of
photos<00:06:01.910> you're<00:06:02.150> able<00:06:02.480> to<00:06:02.600> capture<00:06:03.080> with<00:06:03.530> the

something that will come to the 9:20 and
the<00:06:27.110> 928<00:06:27.860> but<00:06:28.340> at<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.520> same<00:06:28.760> time<00:06:29.060> it<00:06:29.360> won't

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
the 928 but at the same time it won't

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.080 
the 928 but at the same time it won't
have<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.500> this<00:06:30.770> giant<00:06:31.250> sensor<00:06:31.670> that's<00:06:31.880> going

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
have the this giant sensor that's going

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.000 
have the this giant sensor that's going
to<00:06:32.150> enable<00:06:32.390> a<00:06:32.690> lot<00:06:32.930> of<00:06:33.080> photos<00:06:33.410> and<00:06:33.530> that's

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
to enable a lot of photos and that's

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.060 
to enable a lot of photos and that's
what<00:06:34.160> it<00:06:34.250> really<00:06:34.370> boils<00:06:34.490> down<00:06:34.790> to<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.480> camera

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070

what it really boils down to the camera
it<00:06:37.070> doesn't<00:06:37.430> take<00:06:37.610> a<00:06:37.640> genius<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:38.180> reckon

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
it doesn't take a genius to reckon
