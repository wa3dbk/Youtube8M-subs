00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 must decide on the program 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.260
 actions and how next? yes not 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.030
 proclaimed many times you they 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.430
 heard know and so on therefore 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 we all understand that people went to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 Independence because it was not signed with 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 Europe agreements but because I loved 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 began to live in a country that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 violates human rights who 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.710
 plundered into the budget which 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.930
 officials live outlaw which 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 man of his defense and right and so on 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.940
 so we are gathered today for 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 regardless of our 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.550
 party affiliation from some 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.550
 public organizations and so on 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 unite into one 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.760
 union maidan which is quite 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 probably lead us to those 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.090
 state foundations of life of the state 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 which we ourselves seek 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.359
 democratic state compliance 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 constitution of law and power which 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.990
 serves the people therefore I think that here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 already recline the right left views and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.799
 so on come together because we 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.820
 yourself are seriously facing a choice today 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 will there be a state at all if now 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.130
 we can't win this word 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.080
 which we have with you 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 government I openly greta 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 parties of regions and communists 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.479
 who besides protecting their own 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 interests and interests of your gang 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.400
 you can't call them any more 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 nothing exists so we have to 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.409
 unite and look here 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.860
 mutual understanding only in helping friend 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:53.009
 friend in consolidating our all forces 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 time opportunities and fully 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.390
 surrender to what we should 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 do everything to change 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.690
 country to us validly 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.260
 built Ukraine to without 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.790
 hundred which there is a law constitution 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.790
 which there is help and
