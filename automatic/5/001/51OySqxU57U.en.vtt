00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
know he kind of knew the lay of the land

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.839 
know he kind of knew the lay of the land
I<00:05:15.240> can<00:05:15.599> only<00:05:15.750> assume<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.289> he<00:05:17.009> thought<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.729> I

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
I can only assume that he thought and I

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.219 
I can only assume that he thought and I
should<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.150> been<00:05:18.300> at<00:05:18.419> work<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:18.750> was<00:05:18.870> working<00:05:19.139> a

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
should have been at work I was working a

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.650 
should have been at work I was working a
day<00:05:19.349> off<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.820> can<00:05:20.820> only<00:05:20.940> assume<00:05:21.090> he<00:05:21.389> thought<00:05:21.570> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
day off I can only assume he thought it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.750 
day off I can only assume he thought it
was<00:05:21.750> gonna<00:05:21.930> be<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.139> real<00:05:22.380> easy<00:05:22.590> easy<00:05:23.250> pickins

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
was gonna be a real easy easy pickins

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.570 
was gonna be a real easy easy pickins
yeah<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.320> think<00:05:25.590> back<00:05:25.830> on<00:05:26.010> anything<00:05:26.370> you

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
yeah so you think back on anything you

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.560 
yeah so you think back on anything you
would<00:05:26.699> have<00:05:26.820> done<00:05:26.940> differently<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.449> know

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
would have done differently I know

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.839 
would have done differently I know
hindsight's<00:05:28.050> 20/20<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.979> there<00:05:29.430> anything<00:05:29.639> you

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
hindsight's 20/20 is there anything you

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:30.800 
hindsight's 20/20 is there anything you
would<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.060> done<00:05:30.210> differently<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.720> this

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
would have done differently in this

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.560 
would have done differently in this
struggle<00:05:31.370> when<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> dog<00:05:32.669> was<00:05:32.880> barking<00:05:33.120> and

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
struggle when the dog was barking and

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.920 
struggle when the dog was barking and
she<00:05:33.900> was<00:05:34.050> really<00:05:34.409> agitated<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:35.250> probably

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
she was really agitated I probably

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.969 
she was really agitated I probably
should<00:05:36.930> have<00:05:36.960> been<00:05:37.139> a<00:05:37.199> little<00:05:37.470> more<00:05:37.650> cautious

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
should have been a little more cautious

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.370 
should have been a little more cautious
like<00:05:38.490> maybe<00:05:38.760> not<00:05:39.000> just<00:05:39.659> open<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.139> door<00:05:40.349> and

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
like maybe not just open the door and

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.159 
like maybe not just open the door and
charge<00:05:41.220> down<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.639> hallway<00:05:42.090> maybe<00:05:42.389> just

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
charge down the hallway maybe just

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.420 
charge down the hallway maybe just
hindsight<00:05:43.680> say<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:43.889> know<00:05:44.070> what<00:05:44.220> there<00:05:44.400> might

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
hindsight say you know what there might

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.600 
hindsight say you know what there might
be<00:05:44.550> someone<00:05:44.849> in<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.150> house<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.650> get<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
be someone in the house and and get the
