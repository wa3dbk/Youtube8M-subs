00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.060
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 I am CHLOE from Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.980
 London has a 16-hour journey from Taiwan 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860
 Living in Taiwan 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.760
 You have to adapt to the hot and humid weather 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.120
 From May to October 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.480
 Therefore, we really like cold dishes. 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.700
 Today, I will introduce you to a cold dish that I personally like very much. 

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.254
 Cold cucumber 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 Because we are not distinct in the four seasons here. 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.300
 So we have ingredients for every season every year. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.200
 Although the weather in the UK is very cold 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.800
 But this food is great for appetizing 

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.395
 Now I am going to start 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
 You need these ingredients 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.060
 Cucumber, garlic, pepper 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:08.540
 White vinegar sesame oil 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.920
 The first step you need to slice the cucumber 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.240
 After cutting 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.980
 In the crisper 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.635
 Add a little salt 

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.515
 After 10 minutes 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.520
 This way the cucumber's taste will be removed. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.660
 After pickling cucumbers 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.180
 Start chopping garlic and pepper 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.820
 Now we need to clean the cucumbers 

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.136
 Drinkable water 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.900
 Cold salad time 

00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:13.773
 Two tablespoons white vinegar 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.700
 Two spoonfuls of sugar 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.540
 In general, the ratio of vinegar to sugar is 1:1. 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.080
 But you can adjust the amount of vinegar or sugar according to your taste. 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.180
 Because I like dessert very much. 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.940
 I will put more sugar. 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.620
 You just need to stir it 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.020
 Then add pepper and minced garlic 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.480
 Very simple 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.940
 Just need to stir them all together 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.300
 Right, donâ€™t forget to add sesame oil. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.420
 The sesame oil can aggravate the taste 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.500
 Don't need too much as long as a little bit 

00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:39.595
 Then cover it 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.280
 Start shaking! 

00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:47.674
 You're done 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.340
 Now you just need to put it in the fridge 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.800
 Waiting for half an hour 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.580
 You can eat it. 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.900
 Time is up, let's take a look 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.980
 Looks delicious 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.600
 You can use it as a side dish for instant noodles or rice. 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.520
 Or with wine 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.340
 This is very appetizing 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.580
 Let me try it out. 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.320
 Scorpio suddenly feels so hungry 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.500
 My friends, I want more delicious food. 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.600
 If you really like the food I made, remember to like it. 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.620
 Yeah, love you. 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.300
 Hey~
