00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello today would like an interesting 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.859
 answer question and why have 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.429
 sprinters so thick arms respectively 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.110
 so much upper body musculature 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.730
 the question is now more common often come 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 right now in the context of olympia is now 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 unfortunately over but I wanted to but now 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.850
 anyway, just ask this question 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.699
 just answer something 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 learns so and must first 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 make a difference if you say no matter meant 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.330
 probably also mostly big 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.980
 upper body wide back and so on 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 Otherwise first the question is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.219
 actually have been wrong here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 ask yourself why have the decane 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.399
 but why are you training them like that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 have thick 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.579
 that's not coming from the come 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.739
 not fallen from the sky 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 that is why we have them there 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.649
 easy to answer yes to do that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 Weight training 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.230
 the question is why do they on 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 strength training for the upper body 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 that would be the right question and there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.870
 must say researcher what is springing up 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 while sprinting 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 Let's go for example now 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.059
 in the right leg and then again with 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 the left leg and so on and the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.690
 you know definitely when jumping to jump 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 here you have this video and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.479
 so that they are not simply ask 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 Installing we move because there from frame 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.619
 when walking and that's because if we 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 For example, we are quite upset with that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 means she pushes us here 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 real on to my right side 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 then our body turns through that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 Press and cool the body andrÃ© 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.689
 impulse turn left and left around and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.299
 which means that we are left 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.950
 turning around instead of just that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.200
 to the back the city that imprints us 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 and only accelerate forward 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.409
 Let us accelerate forward though 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.790
 turn us a bit and that is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.380
 Energy that's not energy 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.880
 could be warned about the front but 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.850
 a momentum transmitted to the body 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.259
 has been and this is the momentum 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.759
 same with the evening because of the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 others out that means pushing is after 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 behind zack Zack that is called instead 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.799
 that does not turn to the left 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.600
 are for the poor forward is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.950
 So the sense and as well as the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 upper body virtually balanced so that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 The upper body just stays stable and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.259
 does not always turn that way you see 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.909
 already because you just with hands 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the back of a run a sprint 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.329
 completed like your upper body 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 little bit since how much more to shoulder 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.929
 so throw forward and thereby 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.430
 Of course, this also costs energy 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.849
 energy and thus speed 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.859
 that's what it is 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.150
 basic mechanism why we 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.469
 move ours and then we know 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.019
 actually already asked why 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.430
 have these strong arms and in profile 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.879
 because they are so strongly of Hesse 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 pull the trigger and that it is so that the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.879
 Poor we can do with a given 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.159
 to live a frequency means both are 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.200
 yes relatively fast and move year 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.519
 back to the front and then very fast 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.769
 you have to go backwards spontaneously 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.719
 come when the shots from the front like 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.909
 the frames move quickly so the 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.439
 Teaching has everything infinitely fast 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.639
 winner is almost not that is called 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.889
 less at the very fast forward and 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.959
 back and matched quickly because of 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.430
 impulse impulse on the upper body 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.019
 if they move quickly forward 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.269
 bigger is when they are slow forward 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.379
 bring when going transmits only one 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.120
 very small impulse on the upper body 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.169
 while sprinting our whole arm completely 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.760
 fast forward richest again 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.269
 retires transfers a huge one 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.530
 impulses to the upper body and thereby 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.419
 can you then this rotation on 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.689
 the same is thanks to the wise sense of 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.849
 Thing 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.969
 already but I have the following 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.829
 strong muscles you very much 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.979
 vigorously repels behind 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.299
 sprint forward quickly enough then 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.829
 the sole for sometime not 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.030
 more that means we can not 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 moving fast because we are 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.470
 so firmly pull the trigger then, and then you have 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.549
 you just have to increase the mass that 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.019
 means you hear the poor masses 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.560
 you could hear the mass in entertainment have 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.720
 say to the shoulders and in the chest and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.799
 through this increase in the mass must 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.939
 Of course, more collected again 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.400
 so we can get a bigger one 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.019
 pools now transfer the question when 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.810
 Did you know big business big 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.919
 free steps you have big ccs because you 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.689
 need your forearm 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.939
 going so run down as held 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.560
 the son almost made it here 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.699
 stretched as about the angle and 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.099
 Thank you so much 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.530
 and on this account since the disturbing under 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.000
 others and had to be caught 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.129
 the force that he does not stop 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.689
 use that the biceps have because of that 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.949
 they have a big self on them 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.169
 a big triceps that is called here 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.329
 the lower muslims why is very big 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.489
 well the same applies if the evening 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.840
 we're not up here 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.310
 Himself with us and ourselves 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.030
 strike with the crisis are curious 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.709
 go forward and then we like yours 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.269
 again biceps triceps etc 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.310
 that means the forearm 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.079
 needs accelerated why have you 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.090
 Now I have a strong shoulder 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.020
 the microphone rescheduling strong shoulder 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.759
 strong chest 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 strong back well because not only 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.910
 under one vision, not only so but 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.370
 creates the industry shows because of the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
 Whole name what moves the poor the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.909
 shoulder in combination with the back 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.020
 or chest raises the chest 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.240
 makes sda go forward 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.919
 the back makes her to the back and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.360
 that's why they have a strong chest and 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.129
 back muscles because they always have the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.030
 whole arm forward to back and in 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.289
 deal are the little bit 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.720
 speed it must be slowed down 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.819
 will then pull back and 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.240
 That's why they train the power 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.680
 to step 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.569
 but they do not train in isolation 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 you frame the bodybuilders scott 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.539
 Cologne's whole time and stuff but that 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.940
 in a frame of the functional 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.530
 trainings by chin-ups the bank 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.710
 the arms will push gently rule 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.349
 enough trained and so it happens that they 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.240
 have thick muscles and that too 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.430
 reason why you need thick muscles 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.259
 if you have strong legs or fat legs 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.819
 have because of the muscles 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.190
 They also need the right one 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.449
 torso, the same also applies to eg 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.680
 the stomach and the back are standing today 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.940
 have to stabilize that is why 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.509
 should not turn and not one 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.729
 wiggle 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.349
 and when the two are raised 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.960
 when i graduate that we will return 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.539
 back what happens here is yours 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.180
 hip flexor is on at the spine 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.280
 firm the muscle and then pull on 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.770
 thigh bone thigh 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.360
 Forward 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.099
 Now imagine your back 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.259
 Throw strong enough at this train 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.039
 stop 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.319
 then the leg would move forward 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.039
 is to come which is transmitting force 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.569
 just do not fit 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.310
 and that's why they need one 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.449
 strong backstrecker and also one 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.759
 strong need upper body too 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.789
 stabilize that is the reason 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.440
 why sprinters muscular upper body in the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.969
 sprinting whole body is one 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.620
 whole body affair that is the 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.130
 burdened the whole body needs the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.800
 whole body 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.699
 you have to pull the whole body of hers 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.810
 Full body training that is not in 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.800
 a training hall but it will be in 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.690
 Run the whole body during the week 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.490
 trained 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.509
 That's why they have one 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.219
 muscular upper body so many thanks 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.740
 I wish you much fun 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.240
 while training and continues to put me 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.370
 I will try to ask them all too 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.029
 answer subscribed chen remains on 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.199
 the current one 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.199
 thank you very much and goodbye
