00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
medic you have your engineer you for

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.620 
medic you have your engineer you for
heavier<00:02:01.500> soul<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:03.030> max<00:02:03.360> which

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
heavier soul and you have your max which

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
heavier soul and you have your max which
is<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> little<00:02:04.320> mobile<00:02:04.590> body<00:02:04.920> armor<00:02:05.280> which

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
is like a little mobile body armor which

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300 
is like a little mobile body armor which
can't<00:02:05.760> run<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.380> really<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> deals<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can't run but really and deals out the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.609 
can't run but really and deals out the
punishment<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.690> game<00:02:09.990> was<00:02:10.170> actually

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
punishment so how the game was actually

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.590 
punishment so how the game was actually
played<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.700> map<00:02:12.060> thing<00:02:12.090> right

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
played is you go to this map thing right

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.710 
played is you go to this map thing right
here<00:02:12.800> now<00:02:13.800> currently<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.550> am<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.270> red<00:02:15.450> team

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
here now currently I am the red team

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.740 
here now currently I am the red team
this<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.250> purple<00:02:17.640> team<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.150> there's<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this is the purple team and there's the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.840 
this is the purple team and there's the
blue<00:02:18.900> team<00:02:19.140> right<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.250> population

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
blue team right there the population

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.850 
blue team right there the population
really<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.660> one-third<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> way<00:02:22.739> around

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
really is one-third all the way around

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.160 
really is one-third all the way around
so<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> means<00:02:23.580> there's<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.270> max<00:02:24.540> player<00:02:24.870> count

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
so that means there's a max player count

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
so that means there's a max player count
on<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.590> three<00:02:26.070> teams<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.660> see

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.509 
things are how many people are there I
tanks<00:03:44.610> plans<00:03:44.930> whatever<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.739> field<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.250> view

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
tanks plans whatever the field of view

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.720 
tanks plans whatever the field of view
is<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.480> little<00:03:49.380> bit<00:03:49.500> more<00:03:49.739> narrow<00:03:50.220> than<00:03:50.459> I'm

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
is a little bit more narrow than I'm

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.300 
is a little bit more narrow than I'm
accustomed<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:51.780> default<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.380> 55<00:03:53.010> which

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
accustomed to this default is 55 which

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.819 
accustomed to this default is 55 which
is<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.760> console<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.290> goes<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.709> to

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
is really console like but it goes up to

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.659 
is really console like but it goes up to
74<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.660> pretty<00:03:57.959> much<00:03:58.049> have<00:03:58.380> everything<00:03:58.769> on

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
74 so I pretty much have everything on

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.120 
74 so I pretty much have everything on
high<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> graphics<00:04:01.320> quality<00:04:01.500> at<00:04:01.919> medium

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
high with the graphics quality at medium

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.310 
high with the graphics quality at medium
the<00:04:03.190> shadow<00:04:03.460> quality<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.270> medium<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.020> don't

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
the shadow quality and medium I don't

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.780 
the shadow quality and medium I don't
know<00:04:05.380> why<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:05.590> when<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.040> bump<00:04:06.370> up<00:04:06.520> shadow

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
know why but when I bump up shadow

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.420 
know why but when I bump up shadow
quality<00:04:07.210> media<00:04:07.540> might<00:04:07.750> get<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.200> 55<00:04:08.860> 56

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
quality media might get like 55 56

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.610 
quality media might get like 55 56
frames<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.150> when<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.080> graphics

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
frames and when I up the graphics

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.410 
frames and when I up the graphics
quality<00:04:11.770> from<00:04:12.250> medium<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.580> high<00:04:12.850> then<00:04:13.240> we're

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
quality from medium to high then we're

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.840 
quality from medium to high then we're
talking<00:04:13.870> about<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.680> 40<00:04:15.040> frames<00:04:15.220> per<00:04:15.490> second

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
talking about the 40 frames per second

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.120 
talking about the 40 frames per second
area<00:04:16.000> when<00:04:16.360> I<00:04:16.390> can<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.050> know<00:04:17.080> be<00:04:17.560> at<00:04:17.680> 60

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
area when I can just you know be at 60

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.910 
area when I can just you know be at 60
so<00:04:18.750> performance<00:04:19.750> over<00:04:19.989> graphics<00:04:20.470> maybe<00:04:20.709> it's

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
so performance over graphics maybe it's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.370 
so performance over graphics maybe it's
time<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.520> know<00:04:21.990> overclock<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.020> video

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
time to you know overclock the video

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.500 
time to you know overclock the video
cards<00:04:23.770> because<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.640> can<00:04:24.790> still<00:04:25.000> get<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> little
