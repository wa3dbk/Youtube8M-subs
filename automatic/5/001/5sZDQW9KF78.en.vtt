this one is a modern take on those

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.069 
this one is a modern take on those
classics<00:02:49.310> because<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.790> has<00:02:49.939> the<00:02:50.090> oak<00:02:50.239> moss<00:02:50.540> but

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
classics because it has the oak moss but

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.539 
classics because it has the oak moss but
it<00:02:51.170> does<00:02:51.319> have<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> cinnamon<00:02:51.919> in<00:02:52.220> there<00:02:52.370> as

it does have the cinnamon in there as

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.089 
it does have the cinnamon in there as
well<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.090> adds<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.450> spicy<00:02:54.019> yet<00:02:54.650> sweet

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
standing a couple of feet away from me

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.120 
standing a couple of feet away from me

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
well this one projects and I determined

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.690 
well this one projects and I determined
that<00:05:19.200> this<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.710> fragrance<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.250> sits<00:05:20.550> very

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
that this is a fragrance that sits very

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.150 
that this is a fragrance that sits very
close<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.330> skin<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:22.110> only<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.470> 5<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:22.920> of<00:05:22.950> 10

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
close to the skin so only a 5 out of 10

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.120 
close to the skin so only a 5 out of 10
for<00:05:23.400> projection<00:05:24.440> versatility<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.620> ended<00:05:26.070> up

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
for projection versatility I ended up

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.530 
for projection versatility I ended up
giving<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:26.430> one<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:26.730> 7<00:05:27.120> out<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.270> 10

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
giving this one a 7 out of 10

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.520 
giving this one a 7 out of 10
as<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:28.290> mentioned<00:05:28.680> earlier<00:05:28.980> this<00:05:29.550> one<00:05:29.760> is

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
as I mentioned earlier this one is

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.330 
as I mentioned earlier this one is
exclusively<00:05:31.530> for<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.830> fall<00:05:32.070> and<00:05:32.220> winter

exclusively for the fall and winter

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.790 
exclusively for the fall and winter
seasons<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.480> because<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.930> sits<00:05:34.140> so<00:05:34.260> close<00:05:34.650> to

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
seasons but because it sits so close to

during<00:06:50.759> transit<00:06:51.419> so<00:06:51.930> I'm<00:06:52.020> wondering<00:06:52.259> is<00:06:52.560> this

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
during transit so I'm wondering is this

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.980 
during transit so I'm wondering is this
a<00:06:52.710> manufactured<00:06:53.490> defect<00:06:53.939> or<00:06:54.120> is<00:06:54.210> just<00:06:54.449> is<00:06:54.719> this

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
a manufactured defect or is just is this

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.300 
a manufactured defect or is just is this
just<00:06:55.259> something<00:06:55.469> that<00:06:55.620> happened<00:06:56.039> to<00:06:56.159> my

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
just something that happened to my

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.640 
just something that happened to my
bottle<00:06:56.699> alone<00:06:57.060> so<00:06:57.599> I<00:06:57.900> would<00:06:58.169> like<00:06:58.349> some

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
bottle alone so I would like some

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.230 
bottle alone so I would like some
clarification<00:06:59.430> on<00:06:59.520> that<00:06:59.699> if<00:06:59.939> you<00:07:00.060> could

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
clarification on that if you could

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.260 
clarification on that if you could
provide<00:07:00.509> it<00:07:00.689> so<00:07:01.289> without<00:07:02.099> further<00:07:02.370> ado<00:07:02.819> this

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.379 
provide it so without further ado this
one<00:07:03.449> earned<00:07:03.719> an<00:07:03.930> overall<00:07:04.289> mark<00:07:04.529> of<00:07:04.909> 36<00:07:05.909> out<00:07:06.120> of

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
one earned an overall mark of 36 out of

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.019 
one earned an overall mark of 36 out of

50 so once again if you have this bottle

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.089 
50 so once again if you have this bottle
is<00:07:09.779> this<00:07:10.020> something<00:07:10.349> that<00:07:10.379> happens<00:07:10.620> to<00:07:10.889> your

is this something that happens to your
bottle<00:07:11.460> as<00:07:11.580> well<00:07:12.379> how'd<00:07:13.379> this<00:07:13.560> affair<00:07:13.889> on<00:07:14.009> your

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:14.189 
bottle as well how'd this affair on your

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.489 
bottle as well how'd this affair on your
skin<00:07:14.490> do<00:07:15.150> you<00:07:15.270> only<00:07:15.449> wear<00:07:15.719> it<00:07:15.749> in<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:15.990> fall<00:07:16.259> in

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:16.499 
skin do you only wear it in the fall in

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.769 
skin do you only wear it in the fall in
winter<00:07:17.159> seasons<00:07:17.550> as<00:07:17.699> well<00:07:17.729> or<00:07:18.150> would<00:07:18.449> do<00:07:18.689> you

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:18.779 
winter seasons as well or would do you

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.659 
winter seasons as well or would do you
think<00:07:18.840> that<00:07:19.080> this<00:07:19.349> one<00:07:19.590> is<00:07:19.710> compatible<00:07:20.610> for

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
think that this one is compatible for

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.059 
think that this one is compatible for
the<00:07:20.909> spring<00:07:21.150> and<00:07:21.300> summer<00:07:21.360> seasons<00:07:22.020> as<00:07:22.620> always
