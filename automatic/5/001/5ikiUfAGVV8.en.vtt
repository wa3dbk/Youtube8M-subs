what I want to talk about is the first
step<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.620> growing<00:00:11.250> plants<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.910> seed

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
step in growing plants and that seed

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.850 
step in growing plants and that seed
germination<00:00:12.780> or<00:00:13.080> getting<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.380> seeds<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
germination or getting the seeds to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.220 
germination or getting the seeds to
start<00:00:13.920> growing<00:00:14.480> what<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> want<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:16.020> to

speed up or make germination successful

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.330 
speed up or make germination successful
is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> warm<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.020> wet<00:00:19.380> environment<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.220> your

now a great thing to have to help you is
a<00:00:27.180> seed<00:00:27.570> starter<00:00:28.019> heat<00:00:28.230> meant<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> going

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a seed starter heat meant this is going

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
a seed starter heat meant this is going
to<00:00:29.550> keep<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> seeds<00:00:30.119> warm<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> constant

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to keep the seeds warm at a constant

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
to keep the seeds warm at a constant
temperature<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> speed<00:00:32.669> up

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
temperature which is going to speed up

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.549 
temperature which is going to speed up
and<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.059> germination<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.930> successful

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and make germination more successful

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
and make germination more successful
another<00:00:35.370> great<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.329> a

thermometer this will tell you the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.920 
thermometer this will tell you the
actual<00:00:38.040> temperature<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> love

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
actual temperature this one I love

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.330 
actual temperature this one I love
because<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> takes<00:00:40.469> readings<00:00:40.829> at<00:00:40.950> two<00:00:41.100> places

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
because it takes readings at two places

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.299 
because it takes readings at two places
you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.540> 67<00:00:43.260> degrees<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.160> the

this button you can see it's a nice
almost<00:00:48.300> eighty<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.870> degrees<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.770> gonna

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
almost eighty one degrees that's gonna

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
almost eighty one degrees that's gonna
speed<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.420> germination<00:00:51.420> making<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:51.989> more

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
speed up germination making much more

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
speed up germination making much more
