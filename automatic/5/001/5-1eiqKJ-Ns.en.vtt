00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:38.590
Well guys, here I have these pedals

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.933
to show you the "cabinet simulator"

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:47.654
and it simulated a amp, no, a speaker, actually

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.493
I dont know, let's try and see waht happens!

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:53.449
and since we are here, why not

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.675
show you the Fuhrmann pedalboard

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.614
it's made of steel

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.758
and I dont have any idea what kind of steel it's, 
but it's seems nice...

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.486
Man, I don't know what kind of steel it is...

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:11.986
I'm not the right guy to talk about 

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:14.262
something so excelent as the Fuhrmann produtcs...

00:01:14.263 --> 00:01:19.099
But, they ask me, and I'm doing my best...

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.126
but I'll not lie to the people, pretenting that 
I know things that I obviously don't know...

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:21.825
Do you thing I should lie?

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:25.118
the video's director says I don't shoulkd lie, so I'll not...

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.781
so, I don't know, but it's great!

00:01:28.782 --> 00:01:30.961
works pretty well, they have this inclination

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:35.496
and it haves the power supply, the "FT 350"

00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:39.907
and it haves 350 "m.a."?

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.875
have no ideia what "m.a." means...
But it feeds all the power my pedalboard needs

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:48.133
all the 10 pedals  are working great with this power supply

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:54.574
it must be 350 Milliampere, but...

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:58.973
must be... I'm not sure about... maybe it's another thing...

00:01:58.974 --> 00:01:59.974
having said that, let's see the cabinet simulator.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:12.344
I'll play something my my normal sound

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:19.460
using this amplification system, you can't see

00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:25.380
it's a "Borne" amp, the "ClÃ¡ssico T7", by Pedrone

00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:35.795
first we will listen to amp sound, it's a full tube, with 12" speaker

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:40.598
and after that, I'll play though the cabinet simulator

00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:05.188
Better start with some riffs, don't you think?

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:14.568
amp+mic

00:03:48.172 --> 00:03:55.986
and now, using the cabinet simulator,
with exactly the same pedals settings.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:49.743
that's it, Fuhrmann's cabinet simulator

00:04:49.744 --> 00:04:52.366
and I'm Marcos De Ros, saying thanks and good bye!
