00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.220
 I'm code rockies and today one more day 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.740
 I bring another nuclear in the latest maps 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.330
 downloadable black ops 2 you go 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.090
 to see in the background was the first one that 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.710
 I took in this tlc is the take off or in 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.240
 station for those who are 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.329
 players of white are the players 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.829
 something more sir can be said and the 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.689
 gameplay moore better said forgiveness the 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.759
 comment that you are going to hear in the background 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.039
 it's something that you yourselves have 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.560
 proposed is something that I wanted to talk about 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.119
 for quite some time because I want 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.370
 know your opinion I want you to leave 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.680
 in what you think in the section of 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.809
 comments because throughout this 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.390
 streak to know me as I get lube 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.309
 sad that all people will be piped except 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.489
 that a single guy who is able to endure 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.500
 which is capable of supporting not by 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.840
 endure from eating the streak that they have 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.809
 taken to himself that is what he 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.030
 should do because a topic or something that 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.280
 it bothers me very much of all 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.559
 the characters and especially of each 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.120
 song again because it gives me the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.280
 feeling that in each each act that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.380
 was going to happen this was going to go to older 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.740
 because here, as you can see, I'm going to get the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.350
 v 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
 I was going to miss less than 10 seconds to 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.759
 that everyone is going the game 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.590
 be an uncle as I have told you and 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.780
 it's something that bothers me a lot is something 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.490
 what I wanted to talk about not because it's a 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 of the worst things that the call of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.830
 duty to see you think if you take the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.080
 streak a guy who is championing the end 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.909
 of the map with the light I understand 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.950
 well that people will not 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.649
 that people do not have to endure 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.530
 Crazy things that a guy can do but 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.909
 If a guy like me takes you out on the run 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.560
 I'm russian what I 'm moving 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.959
 for the map that I am striving for 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.119
 make and get me a good game or 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.810
 just for enjoying the heat that 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.610
 here as you see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.429
 only one is left has a game 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.990
 that because because people are going to the 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.289
 heading not because people are not capable 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.479
 of eating a streak and themselves in 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.459
 how much do they do right when they are removed 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.950
 their streaks and people are pulling their 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.420
 own departure they begin to complain I say 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 let's see how it can be so 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.500
 hypocritical as people can complain 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.380
 that people leave the games 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.880
 when they do it themselves so if 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.230
 you want to enjoy if you want 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.090
 we kill 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.879
 you do it badly and I make you a streak because 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.890
 because you leave the game because you do not 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.299
 You are going to eat it, which is what I 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
 I was not understanding perfectly 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.640
 those people who are joining this 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.049
 departure and it goes away from it is normal I 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.180
 I also do it I do not see it as a 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.489
 streak that I have not gotten me game 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.980
 only very many times and I do not have why 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.349
 eat streak sometimes others 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.810
 I sometimes do not and it's something that as I say 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.780
 it bothers me a lot, it gives me a lot 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.280
 angry because I get hungry and 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.769
 They take out dogs that take out helicopters 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.480
 many times and I have left if I do not stay 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.489
 I say and because I because I have to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.500
 eat the gusts that get me out if 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.879
 me every time I take something out they leave the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.400
 game because I have to someone 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.010
 true because but kids if you want 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.200
 that you do not leave 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.730
 the games you do not leave either 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.549
 because you have to set an example if you want 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.250
 kill you also have to be killed 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.379
 but that is well said or not but 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.090
 let's see if it 's an issue that is very 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.099
 the order of the day because the people are that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.310
 it goes goes the games and it's something that 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.750
 It gives a lot of anger because I do not know at least 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 I 'm not so lucky that people 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.140
 it is lost 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 that people hold to me all the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 world is ebony and it gives me as I say 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.599
 lot I hated to stay 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.340
 when I get the helicopters 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.989
 when I get the streaks I get 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.760
 a lot of anger because I have to eat 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.470
 half what they have taken me when the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.569
 people do not stay when I get the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.000
 they take out truth so tell me the series of 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.379

 enjoyed the nuclear and is the lad 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.220
 it's the worst that in the call of duty not 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.590
 the people who forget the games 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.690

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.000
