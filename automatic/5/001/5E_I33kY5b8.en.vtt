freezer room can be smaller no smaller
even<00:02:21.840> smaller<00:02:22.670> less<00:02:23.670> energy<00:02:24.150> will<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.569> used

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
even smaller less energy will be used

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.990 
even smaller less energy will be used
because<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.590> air<00:02:25.739> conditioning<00:02:26.280> has<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.700> work

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

less hard this benefits the environment
