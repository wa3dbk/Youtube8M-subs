00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 comes soon there samples comes on time 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.300
 OK 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.880
 this new software 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.580
 not for all percent cooperation available 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 only for space 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.790
 iPhone 3g 3gs bottom 4 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.810
 WS on and 2 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.650
 Weiger not 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 Bonn around 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 this version 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.080
 News 4 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.720
 Maulbronn 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 I show male 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.670
 Percent at 90 1 from the grade level at home is that has no function 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 changed 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.220
 to mixed new book 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.340
 what I as abbot 1 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.960
 or just explain the version 4 point by point 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.330
 1 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.250
 Velen 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.610
 it is unlikely that there will be more multitasking together 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530
 the possible really good 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.240
 To do this, he twice comes to the point waiting that could be reported unanimously 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 takes place as it is in arrears 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.480
 they quote 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.580
 become 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.100
 then Schmitz changed the picture why 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 Many were surprised by these little ones 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 when the heart is full and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 several rescuers come up once or 4 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.450
 Application 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.450
 is impaired 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.129
 little to do yes 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.159
 Otmar 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.339
 these are the lines 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.329
 a place on a pressed open, these crosses open as normal 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.699
 Visit October 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 and whole sentences an attack no 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.849
 and show and was here 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.129
 use this place says Dost and many will 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.529
 now too many cooks possible but only 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.519
 I think two, Braverman said 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.579
 Wet 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.659
 hurt 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.049
 and internet portals via percent 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.399
 Clubs compete we saw 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.399
 he gets more e-books from the App Store 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.949
 or otherwise Ulrich Graf down that 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.539
 that for free 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.699
 b that is in 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.589
 and there could be a favorite extinction there 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 get in a team 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.269
 is finally good news the dive area keeps this good 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.820
 and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.989
 very sociable 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.539
 come on next 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.109
 the playlists 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.129
 now the playlist could be completely new 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.019
 create the collective bargaining rounds 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.090
 but at that time not to let a dancer rest like that I will now 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.039
 Way "In my opinion was 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.039
 like you see them here now 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.489
 camouflage again 9 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.549
 this the camera 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.769
 front 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.859
 Percent to nod off now could be a fivefold 5 pm 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.040
 15 he does not need rubric I do not take a lot of pictures 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.419
 and they are also the little toys 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.209
 for me what is most important 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.209
 Vettel "You can now set a background 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.490
 on 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.549
 on the iPhone 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.549
 For example, we can see these monkeys dancing 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.559
 I was surprised before the leaves were not out yet 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.759
 also Meinecke background can adjust it can be more 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:19.169
 play in the cards and then do not arise 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.900
 that annoyed me Riha food make pick 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:24.740
 4 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.699
 really good 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.339
 then again it is new that numerous 12 one because animals 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.620
 villingen-schwenningen we do 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.520
 This looks like one of the caps down below which you'll be down in quickly 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.710
 Hassler the drama 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.660
 Heating in Nienborg is also concrete for Michel 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.659
 and the customer bad 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.949
 and another small meal function 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.380
 is that just write program it will be displayed again 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.380
 and sometimes very annoying 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.380
 I am 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.069
 This is 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 then very annoying Mannheim 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.279
 uncomfortable 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.050
 that was actually already the new bike path 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.069
 Of course, there are also many officials 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.460
 Milk but you can not list them all Apple says 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.629
 but still 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.059
 Hundreds of new features 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:25.770
 Artmann you already mentioned 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.559
 what I still have business now 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.719
 however, working in the background only works 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.089
 little is food 4 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.839
 unfortunately not on the iPhone 3g 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.150
 and yes we look at 4 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.870
 Eels 92 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.870
 Not necessarily sell a set 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.490
 yes on the whole arms I thank you for listening 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.279
 and the future 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.039
 do not forget 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.039
 actually looking for implausible 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.099
 Ulf say why was
