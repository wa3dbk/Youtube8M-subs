maybe even some paracord to attach the
spool<00:01:52.609> tool<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.299> a<00:01:53.329> backpack<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.200> could

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
spool tool to a backpack you could

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.929 
spool tool to a backpack you could
certainly<00:01:54.590> do<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:54.950> over<00:01:55.609> here<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:55.820> have

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
certainly do that over here you have

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.760 
certainly do that over here you have
your<00:01:56.090> blade<00:01:56.270> which<00:01:56.719> cuts<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.079> paracord<00:01:57.560> and

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
your blade which cuts the paracord and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.069 
your blade which cuts the paracord and
these<00:01:58.219> two<00:01:58.549> screws<00:01:59.119> can<00:01:59.329> be<00:01:59.450> taken<00:01:59.719> out<00:01:59.840> so<00:01:59.869> you

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
these two screws can be taken out so you

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.389 
these two screws can be taken out so you
can<00:02:00.200> replace<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.619> blade<00:02:00.799> if<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.070> does<00:02:01.219> get

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and then over here these little cutouts

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.300 
and then over here these little cutouts
are<00:02:20.600> two<00:02:21.110> things<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.710> can<00:02:21.830> actually<00:02:21.950> put

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
the best thing I found to do is to put

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.090 
the best thing I found to do is to put
the<00:02:40.970> lighter<00:02:41.150> side<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.680> blade<00:02:42.890> side

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.559 
up and then what you're going to do is
take<00:02:45.800> your<00:02:45.950> paracord<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.120> run<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.480> along

on both sides of the spool tool and they
are<00:03:05.570> slightly<00:03:06.050> different<00:03:06.230> from<00:03:06.680> larger<00:03:07.130> down
