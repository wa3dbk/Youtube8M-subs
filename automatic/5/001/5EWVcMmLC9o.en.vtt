much<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> rain<00:00:31.260> except<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.710> suede

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
much in the rain except for like suede

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.040 
much in the rain except for like suede
so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> try<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> stay<00:00:32.640> away<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:33.120> wearing<00:00:33.719> suede

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so I try to stay away from wearing suede

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.950 
so I try to stay away from wearing suede
in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> rain<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.430> find<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> rain<00:00:36.600> doesn't

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
in the rain but I find the rain doesn't

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
in the rain but I find the rain doesn't
really<00:00:37.079> mess<00:00:37.350> my<00:00:37.920> four's<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.760> even<00:00:38.790> threes

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
really mess my four's up or even threes

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
really mess my four's up or even threes
usually<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.320> wipes<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.610> weather

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
usually that just wipes off the weather

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
usually that just wipes off the weather
if<00:00:41.940> anything<00:00:42.270> actually<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.050> cleans

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
if anything actually I think it cleans

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
if anything actually I think it cleans
off<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> dirt<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> bottom<00:00:44.340> dirt<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
off all the dirt in the bottom dirt in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
off all the dirt in the bottom dirt in
the<00:00:45.360> sides<00:00:45.860> it's<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the sides it's my way of kind of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
the sides it's my way of kind of
cleaning<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> cleaning<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.870> bit

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cleaning it cleaning them a little bit

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
cleaning it cleaning them a little bit
but<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.710> rain<00:00:49.950> doesn't<00:00:50.129> scare<00:00:50.430> me
