00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.119
 work against 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.099
 knife attacker working against the knife 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.700
 only when we can't run away 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.320
 if you have the option to turn around and 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.989
 run away turn around and run away 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.290
 what options and so are from the 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.780
 spread maybe hit from below 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.090
 there is a blow from below can be as they say 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.860
 writing date a person wants to cut 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.660
 that is, you have a stomachache 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.730
 please, well, and probably there 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.370
 classic scary 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.370
 thing and hit comes on top first i'm off with 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.640
 lines of attack and either catching up so 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.280
 way it is blocked here and again in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.820
 yo dipped by hand as soon as i barely 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 at least I feel that hand that holds 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.159
 the knife i don't have to hold on with both hands and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.700
 for with all his strength that is the first so that he 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.659
 could not or give birth and release the second for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.880
 so that he does not sit on it about 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.130
 counteracting with one hand if we are still 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 we can fight with both hands I will 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 much stronger hand if I squeezed tight 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.390
 twist her 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.470
 out here now work if goes 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 knife for left right 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.400
 amplitude some kind of movement that is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.290
 they can go like a belly area either 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 Sasha flew area need to try 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.560
 so that the attack goes and that you catch up with her 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.869
 outcome when he went either this way 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.229
 either this way and the hand has already gone to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.909
 him 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.890
 here at this moment when you find him 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.080
 we catch here 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.330
 here everything else can work like this 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.670
 just like it was before that is 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.690
 you twist your hand here to give 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.210
 you can learn to relax again what 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.550
 a couple of knee beats and you can go here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.280
 relax blow in bad one of 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.020
 top kick protection options 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.630
 example they taught me more from them 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.240
 we will bring to that is how they teach the police 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.959
 I catch my hand on the block running 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.900
 and moreover I do not catch it here because 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.850
 as the lever can bend upon impact 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 that is, no closer brush I try closer 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.350
 to this part and goes immediately catching Sina 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 for brush and lie down from my hand goes 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.430
 Here is such a cru. 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.739
 very important and squeeze hard and so 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.360
 come in and clothespins my hand because 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.800
 I'm turning the whole thing turns out like 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.720
 designs so unfolds and when 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.560
 straight arm with proper exposure 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.080
 on the brush of the correct action and there and 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.790
 here on this zone here this zone of spirit 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.890
 knuckles impact and hand not even 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.829
 may not straighten up 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 have sort of actually fired 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.769
 resistance is very much suppress 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.140
 if i have any item of clothing 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.840
 pants jacket T-shirt is much worse for him 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.269
 aim and strike some kind of hit i 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.160
 it also works as a matter of fact 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.940
 it does not cause harm but all walk 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.629
 man cidade him dodges something second 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.879
 can any of the things 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.170
 take the example of wind and into the hands of what 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.269
 show movies it actually 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.090
 the device is correct because that is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.590
 somewhere a knife will cut now he hit 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.510
 arm 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.920
 there is hardly any damage if I have 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.670
 there are several layers wrapped there 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.700
 some kind of fabric 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.360
 there is sand there is a stone there is something else 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.129
 there are standing grabbed right away komi sand 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.900
 you already have some thing to do 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.390
 so that the difference in attention and just bring down 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.030
 confused already if I really throw something 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.609
 then two or three meters he stands with 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.890
 I prepared myself with a ready knife somewhere 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.500
 I throw sand in the eye that is at stake, he 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.329
 seconds attacked for half a second freeze then 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.569
 there is at this moment I can such 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.940
 unity that does not need to climb 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.359
 right on the knife and on the line of attack you need 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.870
 again always go away qi attack line 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.049
 left the line 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.450
 time here already captured here already trying 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.470
 take away his preliminary weapon 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.470
 very strongly fixed
