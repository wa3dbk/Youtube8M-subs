00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the bottom of the other side so a lot of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.400 
the bottom of the other side so a lot of
people<00:00:26.789> ask<00:00:26.970> why<00:00:27.390> can't<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.019> hold<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
people ask why can't you just hold it
like<00:00:28.560> you'd<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> tennis<00:00:29.340> racket<00:00:29.699> well<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
like you'd do a tennis racket well the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.840 
like you'd do a tennis racket well the
main<00:00:30.960> thing<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.920> pointer<00:00:32.340> finger<00:00:32.369> up

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
main thing is that the pointer finger up

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
main thing is that the pointer finger up
on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> racket<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.110> gives<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> much

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
on the racket there gives you a much

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
on the racket there gives you a much
better<00:00:35.399> control<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.600> racket<00:00:37.020> head<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
better control over the racket head the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
better control over the racket head the
second<00:00:38.340> thing<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.420> helps<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
second thing is that it also helps you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190 
second thing is that it also helps you
to<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:41.010> angle<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.850> racket<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.629> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to know what angle your racket is at so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
to know what angle your racket is at so
if<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.710> racket<00:00:44.250> turns<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:44.760> hand<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
if your racket turns in your hand a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
if your racket turns in your hand a
little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.570> you've<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.500> idea<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
little bit you've got a good idea of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.979 
little bit you've got a good idea of
where<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.390> pointer<00:00:48.719> finger

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
where that is with your pointer finger

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
where that is with your pointer finger
there<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.460> your<00:00:50.550> pointer

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
there if you don't have your pointer

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
there if you don't have your pointer
finger<00:00:51.180> there<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:52.020> racket<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.559> turn<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
finger there your racket can turn in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760 
finger there your racket can turn in
your<00:00:53.129> hand<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:55.079> harder<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
your hand and it's much harder for you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.510 
your hand and it's much harder for you
to<00:00:55.890> tell<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.730> angle<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> rackets<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
to tell what angle the rackets on so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
to tell what angle the rackets on so
make<00:00:59.520> sure<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.359> pointer

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
make sure that you have your pointer

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260 
make sure that you have your pointer
finger<00:01:00.989> across<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> bottom<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> bat<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
finger across the bottom of the bat the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.460 
finger across the bottom of the bat the
other<00:01:03.390> important<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> shake

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
other important thing with the shake

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
other important thing with the shake
hand<00:01:04.710> grip<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.549> sure<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> don't

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hand grip is to make sure that you don't

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.840 
hand grip is to make sure that you don't
strangle<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> bat<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.590> you've<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.220> back

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
strangle the bat if you've got your back

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.840 
strangle the bat if you've got your back
too<00:01:09.240> tight<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.780> hand<00:01:10.430> firstly<00:01:11.430> you're

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
too tight in your hand firstly you're

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
too tight in your hand firstly you're
going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.119> lose<00:01:12.360> feeling<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.560> wrist<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
going to lose feeling in your wrist and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
going to lose feeling in your wrist and
also<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.750> harder<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.590> generate<00:01:16.770> spin

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
also it's much harder to generate spin

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
also it's much harder to generate spin
so<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> bet<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.409> loosely<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so have you bet really loosely in your

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609 
so have you bet really loosely in your
hand<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.030> test<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.930> should<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> able<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
hand as a test you should be able to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.130 
hand as a test you should be able to
just<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> bat<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.780> hand

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just take the bat out of your hand

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
just take the bat out of your hand
as<00:01:25.200> easily<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> second<00:01:29.640> common<00:01:30.360> way

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
as easily as that the second common way

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
as easily as that the second common way
of<00:01:30.540> holding<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> table<00:01:31.380> thinnest<00:01:31.590> bat<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
of holding the table thinnest bat is the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 
of holding the table thinnest bat is the
penhold<00:01:32.880> grip<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> penhold<00:01:34.470> grip

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
penhold grip so with the penhold grip

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
penhold grip so with the penhold grip
you<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.310> your<00:01:35.700> handle<00:01:36.420> facing<00:01:36.750> upwards<00:01:37.290> and

different<00:01:48.899> ways<00:01:49.229> either<00:01:49.860> curled<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.790> like

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
different ways either curled up like

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.859 
different ways either curled up like
that<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.790> flat<00:01:54.390> across

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that or you can have them flat across

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.429 
that or you can have them flat across
the<00:01:54.990> bat<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> preference<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.600> your

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the bat that's just a preference if your

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
the bat that's just a preference if your
fingers<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:58.860> curled<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.399> your<00:02:00.060> wrist<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fingers are curled up your wrist can be

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
fingers are curled up your wrist can be
used<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.100> easily<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.969> you've

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
used a little bit more easily if you've

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.990 
used a little bit more easily if you've
got<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.170> fingers<00:02:04.560> spread<00:02:05.159> across<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> back

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
got your fingers spread across the back

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
got your fingers spread across the back
then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.439> better<00:02:07.649> control

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
then you get a little bit better control

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270 
then you get a little bit better control
over<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.819> racket<00:02:09.209> head<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.280> experiment

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
over the racket head so just experiment

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
over the racket head so just experiment
for<00:02:11.640> yourself<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:12.629> one<00:02:12.840> feels<00:02:13.230> more

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
for yourself see which one feels more

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.030 
for yourself see which one feels more
comfortable

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
comfortable

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.960 
comfortable
for<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:15.799> why<00:02:16.799> would<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.010> choose<00:02:17.340> either<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
for you why would you choose either the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.600 
for you why would you choose either the
shake<00:02:18.239> hand<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.140> penhold<00:02:19.590> grip<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
shake hand or the penhold grip there's a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.699 
shake hand or the penhold grip there's a
couple<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:21.000> advantages<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.930> disadvantages

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
couple of advantages and disadvantages

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.250 
couple of advantages and disadvantages
of<00:02:22.769> each<00:02:23.209> firstly<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.390> shake<00:02:24.689> hand<00:02:24.989> grip

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
of each firstly with the shake hand grip

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.039 
of each firstly with the shake hand grip
the<00:02:25.799> advantage<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.269> use<00:02:27.569> both

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
the advantage is that you can use both

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.039 
the advantage is that you can use both
sides<00:02:28.379> equally<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.489> well<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.629> forehand

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
sides equally as well with the forehand

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.520 
sides equally as well with the forehand
and<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.349> backhand<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:33.349> disadvantage<00:02:34.349> is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and the backhand the disadvantage is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.640 
and the backhand the disadvantage is
that<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.150> create<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.450> crossover<00:02:37.110> point<00:02:37.379> where

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
that you create a crossover point where

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.289 
that you create a crossover point where
you're<00:02:37.769> changing<00:02:38.310> between<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.819> forehand

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
you're changing between the forehand

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.199 
you're changing between the forehand
side<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.780> your<00:02:39.959> racket<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.459> backhand

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
side of your racket and the backhand

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.390 
side of your racket and the backhand
side<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.599> your<00:02:42.750> racket<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.220> weigh

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
side of your racket so you need to weigh

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.390 
side of your racket so you need to weigh
those<00:02:44.670> two<00:02:45.180> things<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.739> with<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> penhold

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
those two things up with the penhold

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.270 
those two things up with the penhold
grip<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.420> advantage<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.950> use

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
grip the advantage is that you can use

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.490 
grip the advantage is that you can use
your<00:02:50.519> wrist<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.000> lot<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.230> you're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
your wrist a lot more because you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000 
your wrist a lot more because you're
using<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:52.889> wrist<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:55.230> range<00:02:55.620> as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
using your wrist in that range as

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.550 
using your wrist in that range as
opposed<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.269> shake<00:02:57.540> hand<00:02:57.780> grip<00:02:58.079> we're

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
opposed to the shake hand grip we're

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.759 
opposed to the shake hand grip we're
using<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.819> range<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:00.959> you're<00:03:01.470> using

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
using it in that range so you're using

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.759 
using it in that range so you're using
your<00:03:02.010> wrist<00:03:02.209> much<00:03:03.209> more<00:03:03.599> easily<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
your wrist much more easily with the

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.750 
your wrist much more easily with the
pinhole<00:03:05.010> grip<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:07.109> other<00:03:07.769> advantage<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.579> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
pinhole grip the other advantage of the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.610 
pinhole grip the other advantage of the
pinhole<00:03:08.970> grip<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:09.780> don't<00:03:10.049> have<00:03:10.349> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
pinhole grip is that you don't have that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920 
pinhole grip is that you don't have that
crossover<00:03:11.430> point<00:03:11.609> because<00:03:12.359> you're<00:03:12.510> using<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
crossover point because you're using the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.229 
crossover point because you're using the
same<00:03:13.139> side<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:13.829> racket<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.849> start<00:03:15.090> off

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
same side of your racket to start off

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.229 
same side of your racket to start off
with<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.720> both<00:03:16.590> sides<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.670> backhand<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
with on both sides at the backhand and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.689 
with on both sides at the backhand and
the<00:03:18.329> forehand<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.379> don't<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.919> the

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
the forehand so you don't have the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.979 
the forehand so you don't have the
crossover<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.569> had<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
crossover that you had with the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.729 
crossover that you had with the
shakehand<00:03:22.230> grip<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:24.150> real<00:03:24.959> disadvantage<00:03:25.560> of

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
shakehand grip the real disadvantage of

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.949 
shakehand grip the real disadvantage of
the<00:03:26.010> penhold<00:03:26.699> grip<00:03:26.760> though<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.480> backhand

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the penhold grip though is the backhand

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.309 
the penhold grip though is the backhand
side<00:03:28.199> it's<00:03:28.859> much<00:03:29.190> harder<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:30.120> hit<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.930> ball<00:03:31.109> or

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
side it's much harder to hit the ball or

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.289 
side it's much harder to hit the ball or
attack<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.680> ball<00:03:31.980> with<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.609> backhand<00:03:33.000> side

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
attack the ball with the backhand side

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.979 
attack the ball with the backhand side
now<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.949> backhand<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.669> starting<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.750> used

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
now the backhand is starting to be used

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.860 
now the backhand is starting to be used
as<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.260> reverse<00:03:37.829> pinhole<00:03:38.519> back<00:03:38.730> end<00:03:39.000> which<00:03:39.599> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
as a reverse pinhole back end which is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.110 
as a reverse pinhole back end which is
much<00:03:40.560> more<00:03:40.769> effective<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.549> still<00:03:41.760> quite

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
much more effective but it's still quite

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.069 
much more effective but it's still quite
a<00:03:42.239> difficult<00:03:42.540> stroke<00:03:43.079> with<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.160> pinhole<00:03:44.430> grip

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
a difficult stroke with the pinhole grip

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.479 
a difficult stroke with the pinhole grip
so<00:03:46.079> now<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.290> you've<00:03:46.530> seen<00:03:46.560> these<00:03:46.980> two<00:03:47.220> grips

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
so now that you've seen these two grips

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.509 
so now that you've seen these two grips
you<00:03:48.480> decide<00:03:48.870> which<00:03:49.260> grip<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.680> best<00:03:49.949> for<00:03:50.160> you

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
you decide which grip is best for you

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.250 
you decide which grip is best for you
you<00:03:50.699> might<00:03:50.879> want<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.120> experiment<00:03:51.540> with<00:03:51.959> both

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
you might want to experiment with both
