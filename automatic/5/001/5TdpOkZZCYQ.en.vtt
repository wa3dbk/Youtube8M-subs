00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
start the whole thing off draw 5 and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:37.779 
start the whole thing off draw 5 and
then<00:01:27.049> five<00:01:29.170> draw<00:01:30.170> for<00:01:32.770> 33<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:36.700> that's<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
then five draw for 33 and that's the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.370 
then five draw for 33 and that's the
basic<00:01:38.270> thing<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.539> need<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.689> learn<00:01:38.899> is<00:01:39.740> draw<00:01:40.310> 55

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
basic thing you need to learn is draw 55

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.609 
basic thing you need to learn is draw 55
draw<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.619> 33<00:01:43.249> so<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.840> first<00:01:45.020> part<00:01:45.259> all

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
draw for 33 so the first part all

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.309 
draw for 33 so the first part all
together<00:01:46.130> sounds<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:49.840> now<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.899> second

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
together sounds like this now the second

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.349 
together sounds like this now the second
part<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:52.189> same<00:01:52.399> thing<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.210> add

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
part is the same thing but you add

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.020 
part is the same thing but you add
something<00:01:53.689> called<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.109> triple<00:01:54.469> it<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:55.030> triplet

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
something called a triple it a triplet

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
something called a triple it a triplet
is<00:01:56.060> where<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.329> just<00:01:56.450> take<00:01:56.659> like<00:01:57.499> I<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.859> it's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
is where you just take like I think it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.669 
is where you just take like I think it's
a<00:01:58.009> one-third<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.149> beat<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.259> besides

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
a one-third of the beat and so besides

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.139 
a one-third of the beat and so besides
going<00:02:00.859> dot<00:02:01.960> triple<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.219> it<00:02:04.639> sounds<00:02:05.119> like

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
going dot triple it so it sounds like

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.910 
going dot triple it so it sounds like
this

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.420 

and<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:11.330> same<00:02:12.200> notes<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.590> everything<00:02:12.650> now

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and then same notes and everything now

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.449 
and then same notes and everything now
on<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> third<00:02:13.910> part<00:02:14.239> on<00:02:14.620> when<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.709> when<00:02:16.430> you

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
on the third part on when you when you

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.339 
on the third part on when you when you
just<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:16.790> five<00:02:17.060> put<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:17.900> some<00:02:18.050> tongue<00:02:18.319> action

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
just do five put like some tongue action

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.570 
just do five put like some tongue action
like<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> flutter<00:02:19.520> tongue<00:02:24.280> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.430> that

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
like a flutter tongue kind of like that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.190 
like a flutter tongue kind of like that
so<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.040> now<00:02:31.400> that's<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> basic<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:32.840> parts

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so and now that's the basic three parts

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
so and now that's the basic three parts
and<00:02:33.410> then<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.010> come<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> part<00:02:34.940> where<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
and then you come to the part where it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.930 
and then you come to the part where it
goes<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.920> data<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.319> goes<00:02:42.940> so

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
goes to the data that it so it goes so

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.220 
goes to the data that it so it goes so
I'll<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.120> play<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.480> third<00:02:44.660> part<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.140> you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
I'll just play the third part for you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:56.710 
I'll just play the third part for you
