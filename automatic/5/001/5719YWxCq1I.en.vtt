the eyes in the middle of a track number

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910 
the eyes in the middle of a track number
6<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.570> divides<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.379> five<00:01:01.620> tracks

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
6 that divides the first five tracks

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
6 that divides the first five tracks
from<00:01:02.219> 7<00:01:02.550> through<00:01:02.730> 10<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.660> almost<00:01:03.809> act

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
from 7 through 10 that would almost act

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
from 7 through 10 that would almost act
like<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> piece<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> cheese<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> piece<00:01:05.400> of

meat it serves as the natural middle

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.289 
meat it serves as the natural middle
points<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> feel<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:12.030> with

points but I feel that what we get with

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
points but I feel that what we get with

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
like individual entities almost as

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.219

though<00:01:22.979> each<00:01:23.490> track<00:01:23.909> has<00:01:23.939> its<00:01:24.270> own<00:01:24.420> individual

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
though each track has its own individual

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
though each track has its own individual
frame<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> mind<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.159> frame<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> reference<00:01:27.119> a

terror<00:01:30.210> definitely<00:01:30.900> kicks<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> album

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
it feels like these four blend together

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.559 
it feels like these four blend together

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
dense sandwich but it's also one that

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.180 
dense sandwich but it's also one that

looking<00:03:51.090> down<00:03:51.180> at<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:51.480> playback<00:03:51.810> device

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
looking down at your playback device

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.020 
looking down at your playback device
you're<00:03:52.409> gonna<00:03:52.530> feel<00:03:52.830> as<00:03:53.010> though<00:03:53.220> man<00:03:53.790> you're

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you're gonna feel as though man you're

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.970 
you're gonna feel as though man you're
listening<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:55.110> know<00:03:55.200> pretty<00:03:55.470> long<00:03:55.650> track

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
listening to you know pretty long track

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.429 
listening to you know pretty long track
it's<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:56.970> definitely<00:03:57.120> seems<00:03:58.110> like

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
it's one that definitely seems like

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.580 
it's one that definitely seems like
they've<00:03:58.680> done<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:59.280> lot<00:03:59.640> in<00:03:59.939> order<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.590> really

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
they've done a lot in order to really

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.170 
they've done a lot in order to really
raise<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.069> bar<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.519> bit<00:04:02.670> they're<00:04:03.060> able

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
raise the bar a little bit they're able

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.330 
raise the bar a little bit they're able
to<00:04:03.420> take<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.959> next<00:04:04.110> level<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.709> kind<00:04:05.159> of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
to take it to the next level and kind of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.000 
to take it to the next level and kind of
do<00:04:05.489> things<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.939> multiple<00:04:06.150> parts<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:07.439> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
do things in multiple parts so the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.740 
do things in multiple parts so the
brakes<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.610> are<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:08.909> necessarily<00:04:09.450> cut

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
brakes on this are not necessarily cut

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.390 
brakes on this are not necessarily cut
and<00:04:09.900> dry<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.530> instead<00:04:10.890> something<00:04:11.159> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
and dry this is instead something that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.479 
and dry this is instead something that
seems<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:11.970> flows<00:04:12.209> together<00:04:12.450> very<00:04:12.810> nicely

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
seems like it flows together very nicely

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.039 
seems like it flows together very nicely
secondly<00:04:14.489> we<00:04:14.640> have<00:04:14.849> varying<00:04:15.390> track<00:04:15.659> lengths

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
secondly we have varying track lengths

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.870 
secondly we have varying track lengths
that<00:04:16.199> definitely<00:04:16.799> help<00:04:17.040> suggest<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.669> these

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that definitely help suggest this these

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.719 
that definitely help suggest this these
four<00:04:18.120> tracks<00:04:18.419> span<00:04:18.780> roughly<00:04:19.229> about<00:04:19.350> Oh<00:04:19.729> give

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
four tracks span roughly about Oh give

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.180 
four tracks span roughly about Oh give
or<00:04:20.880> take<00:04:21.090> about<00:04:21.299> 13<00:04:21.810> minutes<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.199> length<00:04:22.410> so

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
or take about 13 minutes in length so

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.920 
or take about 13 minutes in length so

certainly works and finally it's the

this<00:05:35.190> band<00:05:35.430> we're<00:05:35.610> not<00:05:35.760> necessarily<00:05:36.480> getting

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
this band we're not necessarily getting

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.890 
this band we're not necessarily getting
too<00:05:37.800> much<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.160> a<00:05:38.220> different<00:05:38.820> routine<00:05:39.390> from<00:05:39.720> the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
too much of a different routine from the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
too much of a different routine from the
group<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:40.470> so<00:05:40.980> bail<00:05:41.160> foger<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.460> definitely<00:05:41.820> in

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
group so so bail foger is definitely in

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.130 
group so so bail foger is definitely in
a<00:05:41.940> comfort<00:05:42.270> zone<00:05:42.450> in<00:05:42.570> their<00:05:42.690> writing

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
a comfort zone in their writing

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.710 
a comfort zone in their writing
philosophy<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.100> it's<00:05:44.700> one<00:05:44.910> where<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.240> ideas

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
philosophy and it's one where the ideas

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.520 
philosophy and it's one where the ideas
now<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.650> be<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:47.130> really<00:05:48.060> strong<00:05:48.930> ones<00:05:49.320> in

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
now have to be a really strong ones in

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.770 
now have to be a really strong ones in
order<00:05:49.680> for<00:05:49.980> it<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.310> stand<00:05:50.790> out<00:05:51.060> by<00:05:51.240> comparison

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
order for it to stand out by comparison

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.530 
order for it to stand out by comparison
to<00:05:51.870> other<00:05:52.080> albums<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:53.030> feel<00:05:54.030> as<00:05:54.210> though<00:05:54.360> this

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
to other albums I feel as though this

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.990 
to other albums I feel as though this
certainly<00:05:54.960> is<00:05:55.260> doing<00:05:56.010> so<00:05:56.280> in<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.640> unique<00:05:56.970> way

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
certainly is doing so in a unique way

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.330 
certainly is doing so in a unique way
and<00:05:57.510> while<00:05:58.410> lyrically<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:59.010> may<00:05:59.190> not

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
and while lyrically it may not

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.390 
and while lyrically it may not
necessarily<00:05:59.550> be<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.690> most<00:06:00.720> awe-inspiring

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
necessarily be the most awe-inspiring

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.690 
necessarily be the most awe-inspiring
and<00:06:02.400> you<00:06:03.210> know<00:06:03.650> philosophical<00:06:04.650> work<00:06:05.100> that<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
and you know philosophical work that the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.820 
and you know philosophical work that the
band<00:06:05.880> has<00:06:06.090> ever<00:06:06.330> really<00:06:06.660> put<00:06:06.900> out<00:06:07.080> this<00:06:07.650> is

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
band has ever really put out this is

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.550 
band has ever really put out this is
something<00:06:08.100> that's<00:06:08.160> meant<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.640> have<00:06:08.820> a<00:06:08.850> certain

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
something that's meant to have a certain

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.620 
something that's meant to have a certain
misanthropic<00:06:10.560> mayhem<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.700> it<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.480> it

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
misanthropic mayhem to it and it

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.810 
misanthropic mayhem to it and it
certainly<00:06:12.990> provides<00:06:13.200> that<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.130> it's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
certainly provides that and it's

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.909 
certainly provides that and it's
definitely<00:06:15.180> not<00:06:15.419> one<00:06:15.660> that's<00:06:15.870> light<00:06:16.620> on<00:06:16.800> the

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
definitely not one that's light on the

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.890 
definitely not one that's light on the
satanic<00:06:17.400> references<00:06:17.940> this<00:06:18.150> is<00:06:18.210> certainly<00:06:18.600> one

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
satanic references this is certainly one

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.870 
satanic references this is certainly one
that<00:06:19.040> you<00:06:20.040> know<00:06:20.130> makes<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.460> very<00:06:20.640> bold

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
that you know makes a very bold

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.360 
that you know makes a very bold
proclamation<00:06:21.690> about<00:06:21.780> it<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.440> every<00:06:23.160> what's

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
proclamation about it and every what's

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.940 
proclamation about it and every what's
that<00:06:23.580> every<00:06:24.000> twist<00:06:24.600> and<00:06:24.780> turn<00:06:24.870> and<00:06:25.290> possible

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
that every twist and turn and possible

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.670 
that every twist and turn and possible
moment<00:06:26.280> that<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.460> can<00:06:27.350> overall<00:06:28.350> this<00:06:28.500> album

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
moment that it can overall this album

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.800 
moment that it can overall this album
has<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.040> lot<00:06:29.220> of<00:06:29.310> charm<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.730> it<00:06:29.910> I<00:06:30.210> feel<00:06:30.540> that<00:06:30.570> it

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
has a lot of charm to it I feel that it

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.510 
has a lot of charm to it I feel that it
will<00:06:30.930> confuse<00:06:31.350> some<00:06:31.680> but<00:06:31.890> at<00:06:31.979> the<00:06:32.070> same<00:06:32.280> time

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
will confuse some but at the same time

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.600 
will confuse some but at the same time
and<00:06:33.270> at<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.900> end<00:06:33.930> of<00:06:34.229> the<00:06:34.380> day<00:06:34.560> will<00:06:34.830> satisfies

and at the end of the day will satisfies
one<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.510> will<00:06:36.600> definitely

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
one that will definitely

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.590 
one that will definitely
succeed<00:06:37.650> and<00:06:37.860> thrashing<00:06:38.520> someone's<00:06:39.060> face<00:06:39.330> off
