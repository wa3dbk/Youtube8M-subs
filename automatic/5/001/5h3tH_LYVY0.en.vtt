 easy and fun and today we are going to 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.759
 prepare something very delicious because 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.750

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.020
 we are going to prepare a delicious one that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.020
 like 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.570
 I recently read the comments that 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.340
 they wanted some recipes like to 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.320

 more have like a microwave and a pot 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.760
 a perfect recipe ok for is subject 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 has chicken broth and that's it 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.480
 a little bit complicated to make the broth of 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.270
 chicken because you have to buy the chicken 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.699
 wash it and l'hospitalet the leather and then 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.610
 put it here the pot with water and do not 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.110
 hey and other things is a jet and then 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.150
 for like an hour or something like that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 we do not have time for that as well 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.320

 lemon one thing that is very traditional 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.260
 for tortilla eyes is a twig 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.290
 of epazote but I do not have this and I do not 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.000
 I'm going to search because we're university 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.200
 at this time although the first thing that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.390
 we have to do is grab our 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.810
 chile pasilla and we are going to cut you here 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.570
 with scissors or with a knife and we're going to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.430
 try the seeds and this we are going to 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.140
 cut into pieces and we're going to put 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.600
 in this dish that is here and what 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.050
 we are going to fill with water and we are going to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.360
 put in the microwave for two minutes 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.640
 ok ready let's grab our chile 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.430
 We will put the pasilla in the blender 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.840
 just chili no juice this later 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.090
 our five tomatoes nothing more than him 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.490
 if I'm going to split them a little so that they 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.220
 can fly there very well to liquefy like that 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.820
 I cut them like that so we put all 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.849
 our tomatoes and the two teeth of 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.980
 garlic 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.959
 also an onion 4 of course to 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.879
 leave and finally we will put a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.590
 He loves little water in a quarter of 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.230
 cup nothing else so that it can be ground and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.359
 liquefy very well now let's take 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.000
 our pot and we're going to put two 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.859
 tablespoons of oil and this is to fire 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.650
 so we're going to empty it all 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.689
 our sauce carefully do not go to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.239
 burn and do not forget to season it with 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.709
 salt and pepper as it starts to boil 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.650
 Well, well, we are going to add it 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.019
 our 8 teaspoons of consommé or 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.359
 chicken broth until it dissolves 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.660
 then we will add all our 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.400
 8 cups of water 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.740
 now we are going to test it if it is that 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.470
 lack salt we put a little bit if not no 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.540

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.050
 I like war as a four 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.220
 the times that we are going to cut them 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.710
 scientifically so you small strips 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.330
 well since we have them here very short 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.210
 of sight we are going to cut them in half 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.800
 once because I already have a comal or a 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.560
