 either from the primary or as e-mail that is 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.139
 as we do about the migration of winemakers 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.609
 offered both internally and by Microsoft 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.079

 Sony have themselves around 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.890
 the specification as a state secret moment the market also 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:13.759
 blame 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.650
 because I believe alone with the look and feel of the system we already have enough 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.740
 Attract attention 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.790

 for the Sony Vaio x series to get by in October 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.789
 and till then 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.830
