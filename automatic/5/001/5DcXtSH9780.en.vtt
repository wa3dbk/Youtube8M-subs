Hi we're here at Windy Lake Provincial Park and I'm with Ryan. We're going cross-country...

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.640
Skiing!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.820
See what this park has to offer.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.380
You know Doug, Windy Lake is known for its beaches and its waterfront fun, but one of

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.500
the coolest things actually takes place in
the winter. Windy Lake is home to 15 kilometres

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.940
of world-class ski trails that are track-set
and professionally groomed. We're standing

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.140
in them right now. We're standing in them
right now. One of the other cool things, Doug,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.969
I should tell you is that it's home to three-time Olympic athlete

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.929
and 2012 World Champion Devon Kershaw.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.249
Devon Kershaw is from here?

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.720
Yeah, home club, pretty cool. When the snow flies

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.460
The park partners with the Onaping Falls Nordic Ski Club. They've been around for forty years here.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.899
So Ryan if I'm a beginner, you know, which is pretty obvious nowadays, is this a good

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.120
spot for me to start from? Actually, yeah.
They have classic-style skiing and they have

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.220
skate skiing which can take you from absolute amateur to actual - Olympian - Olympic Champion

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.890
Yeah.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.040
Ryan, where have you taken us to now?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.200
Well Doug we just happen to be standing on the edge of a meteorite crater.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.280
Right here?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.060
Right here.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.100
Over two billion years ago, a meteorite almost 15 kilometres across impacted the Earth and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.819
went almost 15 kilometres down into it, and created a crater that was 250 kilometres wide.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.520
When the meteorite struck, the shockwaves created what's called shatter cones. And on

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.910
your drive up to Windy Lake Provincial Park you can actually see some of those representations

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.060
at the A.Y. Jackson lookout in the summertime, and in the wintertime, you can stop in at Science North.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.760
That's incredible. And we're standing on the edge of it?

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.050
We're standing on the edge of it.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.560
So Doug we've seen a lot of cool things in
the park, but one of the cooler things is

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.880
definitely our winter camping yurts. But what makes it the coolest thing is that you can ski right to it.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.619
So our yurts have an electric heater, an electric light, it sleeps six people, you have a large

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.620
deck, a BBQ, a fire pit, and a winter heated
privy.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.160
You have your world-class ski trails out the front door, you have snowshoe trails out the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.820
back door, the lake down the hill for ice
fishing -- it's just all right there for your taking.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.990
You've got everything you need right there

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.500
You've got everything there and it'san absolute wonderful place to be.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.020
Excellent.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.980
Hey Doug, have you seen my hat?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.300
What's that Ryan?

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.860
My hat, have you seen my hat?

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.500
No!

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.460
My precious...
