00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
notable thing is definitely it's a
slightly<00:01:34.560> green<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.220> shooting<00:01:35.850> thing

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
slightly green but that shooting thing

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
slightly green but that shooting thing
out<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
out of it I don't know what that is it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
out of it I don't know what that is it's
almost<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:38.939> poop<00:01:39.630> fumes<00:01:40.020> or

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
almost like it has poop fumes or

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.810 
almost like it has poop fumes or
something<00:01:40.619> coming<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.610> gotta

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
something coming out of it but I gotta

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.889 
something coming out of it but I gotta
admit<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.150> actually<00:01:42.329> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.750> cool

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
admit it is actually kind of a cool

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.929 
admit it is actually kind of a cool
touch<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.619> an<00:01:43.770> actual<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
touch it's an actual more than just

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
touch it's an actual more than just
aesthetics<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> different<00:01:46.290> feature<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
aesthetics it has a different feature a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490 
aesthetics it has a different feature a
little<00:01:47.100> Aurora<00:01:47.490> around<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.750> adds<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
little Aurora around it that adds it so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
little Aurora around it that adds it so
we<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.710> around<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> back<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.430> pretty<00:01:50.700> much

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
we go around the back it is pretty much

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
we go around the back it is pretty much
all<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> same<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.020> looks<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
all the same it just looks like a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
all the same it just looks like a
different<00:01:53.040> tinted<00:01:53.460> green<00:01:53.640> almost<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
different tinted green almost like a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.620 
different tinted green almost like a
doodoo<00:01:54.750> green<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> lime<00:01:56.369> green<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.850> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
doodoo green more a lime green and this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.620 
doodoo green more a lime green and this
other<00:01:57.750> Bulbasaur<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> only<00:01:59.399> slightly<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
other Bulbasaur is only slightly you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
other Bulbasaur is only slightly you
know<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.290> Bluegreen<00:02:01.920> while<00:02:02.219> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
know it's more of a Bluegreen while this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.999 
know it's more of a Bluegreen while this
one's<00:02:02.490> more<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> yellow-green<00:02:03.689> per<00:02:04.290> site<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
one's more of a yellow-green per site so

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.260 
one's more of a yellow-green per site so
it's<00:02:05.130> pretty<00:02:05.310> simple<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.850> gotta<00:02:06.090> admit

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's pretty simple but I gotta admit

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
it's pretty simple but I gotta admit
that<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.780> effect<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> top<00:02:07.590> does

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that that little effect on the top does

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
that that little effect on the top does
definitely<00:02:08.160> score<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.060> style<00:02:09.509> points<00:02:09.629> with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
definitely score some style points with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.309 
definitely score some style points with
me<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.009> move<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.730> Ivysaur<00:02:12.599> ignore<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
me so we move on to Ivysaur ignore the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
me so we move on to Ivysaur ignore the
size

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
size

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
size
difference<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> nothing<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.150> with

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
difference that is nothing to do with

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
difference that is nothing to do with
you<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.410> these<00:02:16.800> shiny<00:02:17.250> are<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:17.580> shining

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you know these shiny are not shining

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.310 
you know these shiny are not shining

that's just pick someone has different
sizes<00:02:19.530> pokemon<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.520> in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
sizes pokemon but you can get them in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
sizes pokemon but you can get them in
any<00:02:20.850> size<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.960> they<00:02:22.110> both<00:02:22.320> look<00:02:22.710> at<00:02:22.830> the

here<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> think<00:03:13.020> Bulbasaur<00:03:13.200> might<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.800> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
here I think Bulbasaur might have the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
here I think Bulbasaur might have the
best<00:03:14.310> one<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:14.550> far<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.450> or<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.230> because

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
best one so far of the or just because

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.230 
best one so far of the or just because
it<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:16.890> obvious<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.670> comes<00:03:17.850> out<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.120> its

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the regular one but it is not my

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.090 
the regular one but it is not my
decision<00:04:40.970> for<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:42.020> episode<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.620> basically

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
decision for this episode so basically

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.370 
decision for this episode so basically
what<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.580> ask<00:04:43.850> or<00:04:44.120> actually<00:04:44.660> one<00:04:45.020> thing<00:04:45.200> before

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
what I ask or actually one thing before

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.430 
what I ask or actually one thing before
I<00:04:45.560> forget<00:04:45.850> there<00:04:46.850> is<00:04:46.880> another<00:04:47.300> part<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.750> is

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
I forget there is another part that is

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.800 
I forget there is another part that is
important<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:48.950> this<00:04:49.040> on<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.790> side<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.510> can

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
important to this on the side you can

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.650 
important to this on the side you can
see<00:04:50.840> they<00:04:51.380> do<00:04:51.740> look<00:04:52.010> quite<00:04:52.190> different<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.570> I

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
see they do look quite different so if I

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.510 
see they do look quite different so if I
recall<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.080> pokemon<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.650> quite<00:04:54.920> or<00:04:55.160> way

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
recall the pokemon it is quite or way

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.510 
recall the pokemon it is quite or way
much<00:04:55.730> way<00:04:56.180> easier<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.870> tell<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.320> as<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.370> can

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
much way easier to tell and as you can

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.390 
much way easier to tell and as you can
see<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:59.060> looks<00:04:59.480> like<00:04:59.780> here<00:05:00.650> if<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.800> go<00:05:00.980> fly<00:05:01.220> up<00:05:01.370> to

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
see it looks like here if I go fly up to

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.550 
see it looks like here if I go fly up to
a<00:05:01.550> PC<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.480> can<00:05:02.510> tell<00:05:02.840> even<00:05:03.080> better<00:05:03.380> that's

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
a PC you can tell even better that's

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.290 
a PC you can tell even better that's
where<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.740> notice<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.190> most<00:05:04.370> these<00:05:04.940> shiny

I think it'd be a pretty good shot to
win<00:06:02.240> as<00:06:02.450> again<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.290> may<00:06:03.500> be<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:03.919> that<00:06:04.130> actually
