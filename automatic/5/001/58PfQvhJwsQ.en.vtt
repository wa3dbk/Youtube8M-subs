there was an interview that they did
with<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.469> with

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
with i think it was with but it was with

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.670 
with i think it was with but it was with
a<00:00:46.910> developer<00:00:47.910> blizzard<00:00:48.300> developer<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
a developer blizzard developer and they

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
a developer blizzard developer and they
actually<00:00:49.829> said<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> models<00:00:50.850> would<00:00:51.000> not

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
actually said that the models would not

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.299 
actually said that the models would not
be<00:00:51.329> ready<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.660> time<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.870> mists<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> pandaria

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
be ready in time for mists of pandaria

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
be ready in time for mists of pandaria
but<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.610> indeed<00:00:54.149> working<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.719> them

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
but that they are indeed working on them

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
but that they are indeed working on them
so<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.350> said<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> dwarf<00:00:56.010> may<00:00:56.309> possibly

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so they said that the dwarf may possibly

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
so they said that the dwarf may possibly
be<00:00:57.030> ready<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.719> probably<00:00:58.469> wouldn't<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:58.980> ready

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
be ready I probably wouldn't be ready

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560 
be ready I probably wouldn't be ready
exactly<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> launch<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.539> are

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
exactly at launch but that they are
