00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
another thing sometimes if I'm gonna

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
another thing sometimes if I'm gonna
move<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.410> something<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.309> I'll<00:01:02.609> drop<00:01:02.789> on

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
move or something like that I'll drop on

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.030 
move or something like that I'll drop on
the<00:01:03.090> floor<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.870> she<00:01:03.989> has<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the floor that she has to put that one I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
the floor that she has to put that one I
think<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.729> might<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.119> easier<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
think what might be easier for me is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
think what might be easier for me is
that<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> game<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that it's a bit of a game it's not a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
that it's a bit of a game it's not a
chore<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.600> normal

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
chore it was normal

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
chore it was normal
one<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> things<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.420> enjoy<00:01:12.450> doing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one of the things I really enjoy doing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
one of the things I really enjoy doing
is<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.560> shopping<00:01:14.030> people<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.330> dogs

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
is like going shopping people like dogs

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
is like going shopping people like dogs
that's<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> made<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.520> function<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.119> were

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that's how it made my function that were

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.499 
that's how it made my function that were
a<00:01:18.299> bigger<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:19.250> because<00:01:20.250> people<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:21.479> oh

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
a bigger I think because people say oh

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.679 
a bigger I think because people say oh
and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:21.930> stop<00:01:22.229> enough<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> snowfall<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and then stop enough for a snowfall and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.950 
and then stop enough for a snowfall and
we<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.280> opens<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:27.360> she

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
we so I think it opens when she

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.200 
we so I think it opens when she
for<00:01:29.960> most<00:01:30.200> trying<00:01:30.530> for<00:01:30.770> life<00:01:30.920> not<00:01:31.219> only<00:01:31.250> like

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
for most trying for life not only like

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.999 
for most trying for life not only like
in<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.479> physical<00:01:32.960> way<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:33.140> she's<00:01:33.530> given<00:01:33.860> me<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
in a physical way but she's given me the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.550 
in a physical way but she's given me the
confidence<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.000> wanna<00:01:35.210> coup<00:01:35.869> d'etat<00:01:36.200> she's

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
confidence and I wanna coup d'etat she's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.740 
confidence and I wanna coup d'etat she's
not<00:01:36.710> like<00:01:36.950> Fairweather<00:01:37.490> friend<00:01:37.850> or<00:01:38.060> once<00:01:38.630> we
