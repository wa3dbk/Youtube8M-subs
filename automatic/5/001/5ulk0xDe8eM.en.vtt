 worked through the character of the joker himself and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530

 tortured his mother's beloved dog 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 to which she devoted much more 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.500
 attention than a son for it in a fit of anger 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200

 touching the veins at symbiote on 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 first glance died and the marriage was sent to 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.060
 the prison didnâ€™t immediately like them by summer 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.250
 and he was already thinking 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.080
 kill him well, their communication was not destined 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 last the veins which is all this time 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.020
 recuperate decided to help his 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.300
 carrier 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.160
 and came to him at the time of escape benom 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.200
 left a small piece of symbiote a 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.480
 who for some reason reached out to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.370
 fly sous symbiot not just merged with it 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.170
 he entered his circulatory system 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.660
 such a close symbiotic relationship 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.099
 made carnage extremely strong 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.810
 the enemy which is the maximum 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.760
 used his potential 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.800
 being in the human symbiote 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.080
 began to grow rapidly and soon he 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 appeared before us like a Cornish without 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.010
 special labors cornet escapes from 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.299
 ravenscroft and incidentally arranging 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.220
 real carnage 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.200
 he begins a series of murders on the spot 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 which leaves bloody every time 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.319
 message from carnage 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.750
 he chose his first victim by chance 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.760
 via a telephone directory like 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.010
 approach clearly shows randomness 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.140
 thinking carnage is what they pursue 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.299
 some specific goals he's just 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.280
 kills after knowing that the unknown 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.019
 maniac suits new york real 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.209
 massacre parker could not stay 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.890
 indifferent first to whom he thought 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.650
 became veins but in the process of investigating 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.560
 he finds information about cellmates go 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 to summer si and his past she leads 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.519
 peter in the only place that 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.530
 cassidy could be considered home to the old 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.900
 a burnt down shelter where he spent a big 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.790
 part of his childhood surprise parker 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.440
 he really meets there a kletus and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.359
 trying to stop but that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.220
 transformed into carne ja first 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.260
 fight with this opponent was given to peter 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.269
 not easy he tried to get used to new 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.370
 abilities symbiote about which not previously 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.690
 observed the veins and how for example the creation 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.549
 cold weapon based 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.950
 symbiotic costume and even 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.230
 short term separation from his body in 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.600
 as a result, Carnot opened up and Peter stayed 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.400
 alone with your thoughts about how 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.049
 same monster just encountered 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.030
 realizing that with this enemy he is not 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.680
 cope with Johnny by storm 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.510
 goes for help to his 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.940
 sworn enemy not long before these 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.160
 event veins moved parker to one of 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.569
 Caribbean Islands so there 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 finish them once and for all 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.130
 confrontation parker realized that brok 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.230
 never leave him alone until he 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.510
 alive and staged his death 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.190
 the rent was left alone on the island 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.010
 himself and what was his surprise 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.989
 when a live parker appeared on the island and 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.060
 started asking him for help after 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.410
 short brawl involving 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.630
 all three parkru 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.030
 it's convincing go and he agrees to help 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.220
 with the humility of his offspring but with one 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.380
 the condition of their life is never again 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 must cross after the conclusion of the union 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.250
 our heroes set off new york where for 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.780
 mental connection of symbiotes 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.150
 quickly go on the trail 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.980
 carnage first encounter is over 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.020
 failure and cassidy hiding behind 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.790
 innocent could hide again but in 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.040
 next time a new duet 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.300
 managed to beat carnage scramble out 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.310
 subway tunnels literally 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.620
 moved to the theater stage 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.720
 while the veins fought with their offspring 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.800
 spiderman remembered the approximate 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.230
 sound frequency 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.750
 which was used to remove 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.460
 his symbiotic suit and immediately 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.800
 try to reproduce it with 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.290
 local equipment both symbiotes 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.510
 suffered enormous torment and in the end 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.880
 carnage fell veins continued 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.580
 confront but parker was in no hurry 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.500
 turn off the sound broker realized that parker him 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.390
 cheated and not at all going to him 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.460
 let go after beating karni john 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.890
 gathering the last power fed 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.660
 hatred for Peter these tried to kill 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.430
 his time came in time 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.620
 Fantastic Four could him 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.450
 stop the athlete from cassidy at first 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.430
 glance lost its symbiots 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.740
 re-send to ravenscroft true 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.170
 there he stayed for a short time all around 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.240
 believed that symbiot died but in fact 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.400
 In fact, he simply lurked in the body of the kletus 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.440
 and recuperated by escaping from 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.960
 prisons he teamed up with such villains 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.030
 like the ginger snipe snipe and dima 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.410
 goblin together they went to create 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.210
 maximum slaughter 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.250
 but we will look at these events somehow 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.350
 next time the character itself 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.540
 carnage turned out very charismatic and 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.340
 memorable reader initially 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.200
 it was he who was supposed to take the place of the vein 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.419
 matches carrier eddie brook had to 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.140
 die in the 400th edition of amazing 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.270
 spider-man 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.040
 but because of the increasing popularity 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.570
 character this did not happen carnage in 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.470
 any moral principles of his 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.870
 philosophy is based on complete freedom and 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.970
 the chaos that he brings to the world that 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.160
 order in itself is absurd and any 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.500
 free to do what he wants for example 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.330
 karno jo kill everyone around of course 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.430
 his worldview was formed by 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.740

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.150
