00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
sharp enough to decapitate mutants and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.789 
sharp enough to decapitate mutants and
bandits<00:03:18.400> alike<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:19.540> concept<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.169> simple<00:03:20.410> but

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
bandits alike the concept is simple but

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.550 
bandits alike the concept is simple but
the<00:03:20.859> execution<00:03:21.629> just<00:03:22.629> feels<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.049> right<00:03:23.079> on<00:03:23.379> so

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
the execution just feels so right on so

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.099 
the execution just feels so right on so
many<00:03:23.680> levels<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:25.030> accuracy<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.690> speed<00:03:25.840> at

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
many levels the accuracy and speed at

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.240 
many levels the accuracy and speed at
which<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.379> can<00:03:26.500> switch<00:03:26.680> between<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.010> sticks

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
which you can switch between the sticks

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.979 
which you can switch between the sticks
is<00:03:27.430> what<00:03:27.609> really<00:03:27.790> helps<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.239> stand<00:03:28.480> out<00:03:28.690> and

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
is what really helps it stand out and

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.780 
is what really helps it stand out and
while<00:03:29.859> there<00:03:29.980> are<00:03:30.069> tons<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.370> other<00:03:30.459> guns

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
throughout the game I found myself

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.349 
throughout the game I found myself
resorting<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.190> insanely<00:03:33.699> fun<00:03:33.970> woman<00:03:34.269> of
