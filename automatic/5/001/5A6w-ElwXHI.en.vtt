00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
seriously this is not you see if I had

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.430

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
jumped right away I would have gotten

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.650 
jumped right away I would have gotten
hit<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.919> plummeted<00:04:32.370> into<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.760> ground<00:04:33.030> but

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.980 
hit and plummeted into the ground but
because<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> waited<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.620> got<00:04:35.070> hit<00:04:35.280> anyway<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.450> i

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
because I waited I got hit anyway and i

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.050 
because I waited I got hit anyway and i
think<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> timer<00:04:37.860> starts<00:04:38.370> as<00:04:38.520> soon<00:04:38.580> as<00:04:38.910> you

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
think the timer starts as soon as you

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.460 
think the timer starts as soon as you
enter<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.390> screen<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.850> if<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.120> sync<00:04:43.050> them<00:04:43.320> up

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
enter the screen so if you sync them up

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.159 
enter the screen so if you sync them up
wrongly<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.340> can<00:04:44.550> easily<00:04:44.760> do<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.120> this<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
wrongly you can easily do that this is

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.870 
wrongly you can easily do that this is
going<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.620> very<00:04:46.890> very<00:04:47.070> hard<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.820> very
