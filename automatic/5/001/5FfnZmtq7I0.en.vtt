00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.700 
about which slider to use or which way
to<00:01:58.830> pull<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.429> just<00:01:59.940> follows<00:02:00.300> your<00:02:00.450> mouse<00:02:00.710> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to pull it just follows your mouse you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.700 
to pull it just follows your mouse you
get<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.190> chin<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> jawline<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
get the chin we have the jawline and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.279 
get the chin we have the jawline and
again<00:02:05.550> same<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> body<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:07.140> have

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
again same with the body we have

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.559 
again same with the body we have
different<00:02:07.649> manipulation<00:02:08.280> points<00:02:08.700> depending

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
different manipulation points depending

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.780 
different manipulation points depending
on<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:09.929> angle<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.800> looking<00:02:11.519> at<00:02:11.670> your

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
on which angle you're looking at your

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.360 
on which angle you're looking at your
sim<00:02:12.030> from<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.709> move<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> mouth<00:02:14.190> in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
sim from so you can move the mouth in

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.640 
sim from so you can move the mouth in
and<00:02:14.519> out<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.030> view<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:16.350> move<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and out from this view you can move the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.240 
and out from this view you can move the
jaw

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
jaw

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 
jaw
we<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.940> rotational<00:02:18.570> movements<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.079> under

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
we have rotational movements so under

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.050 
we have rotational movements so under
the<00:02:19.440> hood<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.799> we<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.100> many<00:02:20.430> sliders<00:02:20.880> going

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the hood here we have many sliders going

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
the hood here we have many sliders going
to<00:02:21.420> work<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.900> tandem<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> same<00:02:22.920> time

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
to work all in tandem at the same time

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.600 
to work all in tandem at the same time
that's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.160> good<00:02:26.310> one

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610

of<00:02:41.350> facial<00:02:41.530> bone<00:02:42.010> structures<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:42.820> can

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
of facial bone structures that we can

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.880 
of facial bone structures that we can
supply<00:02:43.300> people<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.050> most<00:02:44.290> important<00:02:44.710> thing

they can relate to and we have built the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.490 
they can relate to and we have built the
sims<00:02:53.440> faces<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:54.340> interchangeable<00:02:55.240> parts<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
sims faces as interchangeable parts that

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.960 
sims faces as interchangeable parts that
are<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:56.860> much<00:02:57.040> easier<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.430> get<00:02:57.640> ethnic

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
are so much easier to get ethnic

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.970 
are so much easier to get ethnic
diversity<00:02:58.150> than<00:02:58.780> any<00:02:59.080> previous<00:02:59.560> games<00:02:59.770> when

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
diversity than any previous games when

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100 
diversity than any previous games when
we've<00:03:00.130> had<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.490> far<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.600> here's<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.080> few

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
we've had so far so here's just a few

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.350 
we've had so far so here's just a few
snippets<00:03:02.530> these<00:03:03.340> are<00:03:03.520> all<00:03:03.610> starter<00:03:04.000> points

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
snippets these are all starter points

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.910 
snippets these are all starter points
you're<00:03:04.540> not<00:03:04.720> locked<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.170> any<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.530> these<00:03:05.650> faces

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
you're not locked to any of these faces

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.580 
you're not locked to any of these faces
so<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.270> you'd<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> start<00:03:08.050> with<00:03:08.260> one<00:03:08.470> of

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
so if you'd like to start with one of

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.980 
so if you'd like to start with one of
them<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:09.970> further<00:03:10.300> go<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
them you can then further go in and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.110 
them you can then further go in and
customize<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.500> more<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.400> these<00:03:12.520> presets<00:03:12.970> on

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
customize it more with these presets on

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.180 
customize it more with these presets on
the<00:03:13.209> side<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:14.350> course<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.890> direct

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
the side and of course with the direct

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
manipulation modifiers so while I'm on

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.760 
manipulation modifiers so while I'm on
her<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.730> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.450> bring<00:03:23.140> her<00:03:23.320> back<00:03:23.350> out<00:03:23.650> in

like I showed you those face presets to

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.860 
like I showed you those face presets to
change<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.709> bone<00:03:29.920> structure<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:31.060> also<00:03:31.360> have

everybody is built the same way we have
a<00:03:36.940> bunch<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.540> different<00:03:37.900> body<00:03:38.050> shapes<00:03:38.380> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
a bunch of different body shapes that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.710 
a bunch of different body shapes that
you<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.620> start<00:03:39.070> from<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:40.030> you're<00:03:40.180> not<00:03:40.420> locked

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
you can start from but you're not locked

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
those details a little bit more you can

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.979 
those details a little bit more you can
just<00:03:45.519> reach<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.269> do<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.810> get
