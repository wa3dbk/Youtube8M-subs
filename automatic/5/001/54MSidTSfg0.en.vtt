okay<00:00:02.159> here's<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.399> fig<00:00:02.669> tree<00:00:02.700> that<00:00:03.090> I've<00:00:03.500> grafted

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay here's a fig tree that I've grafted

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay here's a fig tree that I've grafted
different<00:00:05.400> varieties<00:00:05.759> onto<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.410> use<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.589> tool

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
different varieties onto I use this tool

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.220 
different varieties onto I use this tool
here<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.670> called<00:00:08.910> some<00:00:09.150> kind<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.420> Omega

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
here it's called some kind of Omega

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.410 
here it's called some kind of Omega
something<00:00:10.830> graft<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.660> in<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.840> part<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.590> I

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
something graft or in this part here I

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.450 
something graft or in this part here I
can<00:00:15.420> show<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.039> makes<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.340> an

can show you makes kind of an

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.130 
can show you makes kind of an
indentation<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> mark<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
indentation you see the mark there and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710 
indentation you see the mark there and
you<00:00:19.800> cut<00:00:20.760> two<00:00:20.910> pieces<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.330> fit<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> puzzle

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you cut two pieces to fit like a puzzle

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.640 
you cut two pieces to fit like a puzzle
piece<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.150> here's<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.510> graft<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.050> did<00:00:25.199> last<00:00:25.410> year

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
piece and here's a graft I did last year

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
piece and here's a graft I did last year
and<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> puzzle

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and you can see that kind of puzzle

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
and you can see that kind of puzzle
piece<00:00:27.750> figure<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.279> coming<00:00:29.550> together

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
piece figure how it's coming together

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.930 
piece figure how it's coming together
and<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.870> did<00:00:34.020> nine<00:00:34.469> grafts<00:00:34.829> last<00:00:35.160> year<00:00:35.460> three

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and so I did nine grafts last year three

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
and so I did nine grafts last year three
of<00:00:36.030> them<00:00:36.149> took<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:37.530> three<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> ones

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of them took and all three of the ones

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.450 
of them took and all three of the ones
that<00:00:38.579> took<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.570> film<00:00:40.230> called<00:00:40.530> buddy<00:00:40.890> tape

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that took I use a film called buddy tape

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
that took I use a film called buddy tape
the<00:00:42.360> other<00:00:42.510> stick<00:00:42.780> set<00:00:42.960> parafilm<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the other stick set parafilm and the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
the other stick set parafilm and the
pair<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> film<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.360> believe<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.440> didn't<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
pair of film I believe I didn't do it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.240 
pair of film I believe I didn't do it
well<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.820> dried<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.980> graphs

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
well and it dried up and the the graphs

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.450 
well and it dried up and the the graphs
dried<00:00:50.670> before<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.180> could<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
dried before they could take so this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
dried before they could take so this
year<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> bought<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> roll<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> buddy<00:00:54.660> film<00:00:54.989> buddy

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
year I bought a roll of buddy film buddy

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.330 
year I bought a roll of buddy film buddy
tape<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.230> good<00:00:58.680> success<00:00:59.100> rate

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
tape and it's it's good success rate

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.470 
tape and it's it's good success rate
there's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.960> panache<00:01:00.960> graft

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
there's a panache graft

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.820 
there's a panache graft
here's<00:01:03.480> another<00:01:03.600> panache<00:01:04.199> graft<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.830> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
here's another panache graft this one I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
here's another panache graft this one I
can<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.490> moisture<00:01:08.670> salon<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.390> hasn't<00:01:09.720> pushed

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can see moisture salon it hasn't pushed

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.070 
can see moisture salon it hasn't pushed
but<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.920> try<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> two<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.990> these

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
but it's not try it out so two of these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.789 
but it's not try it out so two of these
three<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:15.170> see<00:01:16.170> moisture<00:01:16.350> under

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
three of take in I see moisture under

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640 
three of take in I see moisture under
this<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> looks<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.640> pushing<00:01:18.650> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this and it looks like it's pushing this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.219 
this and it looks like it's pushing this
one<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> pushing<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:21.439> this<00:01:22.439> one's<00:01:22.850> out

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
one is just pushing here this one's out

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
one is just pushing here this one's out
those<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.500> panache<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:27.320> there's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
those are all panache and then there's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.690 
those are all panache and then there's
another<00:01:28.439> panache<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.250> over<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
another panache and then over here I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.280 
another panache and then over here I
have<00:01:30.049> violet<00:01:31.049> de<00:01:31.170> Bordeaux<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.939> has

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
have violet de Bordeaux and this has

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
have violet de Bordeaux and this has
good<00:01:34.290> success<00:01:34.680> rate<00:01:34.950> -<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:37.549> pushed<00:01:38.549> well<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
good success rate - so pushed well this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.520 
good success rate - so pushed well this
is<00:01:39.270> pushed<00:01:39.509> well<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is pushed well so is this one so that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
is pushed well so is this one so that
one<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:45.600> yeah

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
one and then just this one well yeah

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
one and then just this one well yeah
actually<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.909> see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
actually even this one I can see it see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
actually even this one I can see it see
buds<00:01:48.329> pushing<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> buddy

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
buds pushing out so I think the buddy

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
buds pushing out so I think the buddy
film<00:01:50.520> buddy<00:01:51.299> tape<00:01:51.920> made<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> big<00:01:53.189> difference<00:01:55.040> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
film buddy tape made a big difference so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.950 
film buddy tape made a big difference so
this<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.610> tree<00:01:56.939> will<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:59.540> three<00:02:00.540> three

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this this tree will have three three

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
this this tree will have three three
figs<00:02:01.200> grafted<00:02:01.680> onto<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.399> ones<00:02:02.759> from

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
figs grafted onto it these ones from

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.440 
figs grafted onto it these ones from
last<00:02:03.030> year<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.570> strawberry<00:02:04.049> Verte

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
last year are strawberry Verte

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.240 
last year are strawberry Verte
and<00:02:06.310> they're<00:02:07.310> actually<00:02:07.430> putting<00:02:07.939> some<00:02:08.270> little

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and they're actually putting some little

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.330 
and they're actually putting some little
things<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.640> here<00:02:10.940> main<00:02:11.150> crop<00:02:11.390> fix

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
and I've cut all the Peter sunny off
because<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> energy<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.860> go<00:02:24.980> to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
because I want all the energy to go to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.120 
because I want all the energy to go to
the<00:02:25.190> graphs<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.500> obviously<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.800> tree<00:02:28.010> will

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
the graphs and obviously the tree will

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.830 
the graphs and obviously the tree will
sprout<00:02:28.400> from<00:02:28.459> other<00:02:28.790> places<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.480> I'll<00:02:29.600> also

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
sprout from other places so I'll also

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.620 
sprout from other places so I'll also
get<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> Peters<00:02:30.590> honey<00:02:31.580> branch<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.120> somewhere

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
get a Peters honey branch in somewhere

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.050 
get a Peters honey branch in somewhere
or<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.050> couple<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.440> them<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.640> wanted<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
or a couple of them but I wanted all the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.360 
or a couple of them but I wanted all the
energy<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.739> graphs<00:02:36.980> for

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
energy to go to the to the graphs for

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.000 
energy to go to the to the graphs for
now<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> I've<00:02:38.870> been<00:02:38.959> pulling<00:02:39.290> off<00:02:39.410> any<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.709> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
now so I've been pulling off any of the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.630 
now so I've been pulling off any of the
mother<00:02:40.640> trees<00:02:40.970> growth<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:44.989> this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
mother trees growth and you can see this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.890 
mother trees growth and you can see this
tree<00:02:46.640> looks<00:02:46.819> lopsided<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:47.690> because

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
tree looks lopsided but that's because

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.449 
tree looks lopsided but that's because
the<00:02:48.019> graphs<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.440> took<00:02:48.620> last<00:02:48.860> year<00:02:49.069> on<00:02:49.280> this

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
the graphs in took last year on this

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.940 
the graphs in took last year on this
side<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> these<00:02:51.019> are<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.319> leaves<00:02:51.620> from<00:02:51.799> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
side so these are all leaves from the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.210 
side so these are all leaves from the
strawberry<00:02:52.370> verde<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.830> then<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.130> all

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
strawberry verde and then you see all

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.770 
strawberry verde and then you see all
the<00:02:55.340> new<00:02:55.370> graphs<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.330> looking<00:02:56.600> good

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the new graphs so it's looking good

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.479 
the new graphs so it's looking good
so<00:02:59.780> okay<00:03:00.410> somebody<00:03:00.769> wants<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.010> try<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.340> graph

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
so okay somebody wants to try and graph

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.240 
so okay somebody wants to try and graph
the<00:03:01.700> fig<00:03:01.880> tree<00:03:02.200> even<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.380> novice<00:03:03.769> like<00:03:03.950> me<00:03:04.190> you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the fig tree even a novice like me you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.810 
the fig tree even a novice like me you
can<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.780> it
