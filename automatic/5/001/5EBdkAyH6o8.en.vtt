I<00:01:01.109> mean<00:01:01.829> surprisingly<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.300> multitasking

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I mean surprisingly the multitasking

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.320 
I mean surprisingly the multitasking
doesn't<00:01:04.739> seem<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.129> putting<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.700> drain<00:01:06.570> on

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
doesn't seem to be putting a drain on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
doesn't seem to be putting a drain on
doesn't<00:01:09.330> seem<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.540> put<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> drain<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
doesn't seem to be put in a drain on the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.690 
doesn't seem to be put in a drain on the
system<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> thought<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:12.260> but

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
system I thought that it would but

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.770 
system I thought that it would but
nothing<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> lagging<00:01:15.030> nothing's<00:01:15.479> acting

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
nothing is lagging nothing's acting

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.609 
nothing is lagging nothing's acting
weird<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> play<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.909> music<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:19.560> an

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
weird so play some music here and get an

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.429 
weird so play some music here and get an
idea<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.119> what<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.240> experience<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
idea of what that experience is like can

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.090 
idea of what that experience is like can
obviously<00:01:22.680> use<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.520> controls<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:25.009> right<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
obviously use the controls here right in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
obviously use the controls here right in
his<00:01:26.189> control<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.170> music

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
his control right there and music

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
his control right there and music
controls<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.220> nice

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
controls which is pretty nice

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.730 
controls which is pretty nice
and<00:01:30.840> obviously<00:01:32.390> multitasking<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
and obviously multitasking just as I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
and obviously multitasking just as I
mentioned<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:41.030> quick<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.210> right

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
mentioned so this is a quick look right

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.639 
mentioned so this is a quick look right
now<00:01:43.310> at<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.920> iPad<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.159> iOS<00:01:47.579> 4<00:01:48.560> typically<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
now at the iPad with iOS 4 typically the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.990 
now at the iPad with iOS 4 typically the
web<00:01:49.829> page<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> last<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
web page here I think the last thing I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.069 
web page here I think the last thing I
was<00:01:51.060> looking<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.009> g2<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> obviously

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
was looking at was the g2 so obviously

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.940 
was looking at was the g2 so obviously
browsing<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.200> working<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> would

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
browsing and working just as you would

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
browsing and working just as you would
expect<00:01:59.509> except<00:02:00.509> now<00:02:00.659> you've<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:02.780> options<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
expect except now you've got options to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.469 
expect except now you've got options to
multitask<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> great<00:02:05.299> because<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
multitask which is great because I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
multitask which is great because I
remember<00:02:06.719> jailbreaking<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.439> until<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
remember jailbreaking up until this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.210 
remember jailbreaking up until this
point<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:09.300> nice<00:02:09.890> we're<00:02:10.890> early<00:02:11.009> in
