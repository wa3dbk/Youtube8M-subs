00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
in this video from IT free training I

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.180 
in this video from IT free training I
will<00:00:02.639> look<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.360> new<00:00:03.629> features<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.200> DNS<00:00:04.859> for

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
will look at the new features in DNS for

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.849 
will look at the new features in DNS for
Windows<00:00:05.549> Server<00:00:05.759> 2012<00:00:06.330> there<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.319> only<00:00:07.500> two

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
Windows Server 2012 there are only two

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.730 
Windows Server 2012 there are only two
new<00:00:08.040> features<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.790> let's<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> look<00:00:09.740> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
new features so let's have a look the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.100 
new features so let's have a look the
first<00:00:11.040> feature<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.490> improved<00:00:12.210> PowerShell

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
first feature is improved PowerShell

feature<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> improved<00:00:37.590> support<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.160> DNS<00:00:38.850> SEC

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
feature is improved support for DNS SEC

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.440 
feature is improved support for DNS SEC
DNS<00:00:40.649> SEC<00:00:41.040> essentially<00:00:41.610> provides<00:00:42.000> additional

DNS SEC essentially provides additional

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.920 
DNS SEC essentially provides additional
security<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.530> DNS<00:00:44.040> preventing<00:00:45.000> DNS<00:00:45.510> records

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
security for DNS preventing DNS records

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
security for DNS preventing DNS records
and<00:00:46.170> DNS<00:00:46.829> transfers<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.670> being<00:00:47.969> tampered

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and DNS transfers from being tampered

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.520 
and DNS transfers from being tampered
with<00:00:48.629> by<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.170> attacker<00:00:50.989> DNS<00:00:51.989> SEC<00:00:52.289> was

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
with by an attacker DNS SEC was

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.400 
with by an attacker DNS SEC was
available<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> Windows<00:00:53.699> Server<00:00:53.910> 2008<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
available in Windows Server 2008 but it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.889 
available in Windows Server 2008 but it
has<00:00:55.590> been<00:00:55.770> improved<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.610> Windows<00:00:57.090> Server<00:00:57.270> 2012

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
has been improved in Windows Server 2012

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.619 
has been improved in Windows Server 2012
I<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> closer<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.480> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that this is occurring

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570 
that this is occurring
this<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.440> hackers<00:02:14.770> want<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.129> happen<00:02:15.459> in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.610 
found that can answer the query for this
reason<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.940> makes<00:04:07.329> sense<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.139> root<00:04:08.380> hint

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
reason it makes sense that the root hint

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.610 
reason it makes sense that the root hint
server<00:04:09.069> needs<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.910> be<00:04:10.030> trusted<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:11.440> root

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
server needs to be trusted so the root

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.559 
server needs to be trusted so the root
hint<00:04:11.799> server<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.519> what<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.940> would<00:04:13.090> call<00:04:13.150> a

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
hint server is what you would call a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.140 
hint server is what you would call a
trust<00:04:13.989> anchor<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:15.370> root<00:04:15.549> hint<00:04:15.760> server

this example is an au DNS server is

this example is an au DNS server is

contacted this DNS server supports DNS
SEC<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.030> can<00:04:34.180> use<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.510> signature<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.260> the

root<00:04:35.710> hint<00:04:36.010> server<00:04:36.630> basically<00:04:37.630> what<00:04:37.810> is

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
root hint server basically what is

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.140 
root hint server basically what is
happening<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:39.070> root<00:04:39.280> hint<00:04:39.520> server<00:04:39.910> is

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
happening is the root hint server is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.770 
happening is the root hint server is
saying<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.960> trusts<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.860> au<00:04:42.310> server<00:04:42.780> the

saying it trusts the au server the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.689 
saying it trusts the au server the
problem<00:04:44.320> occurs<00:04:44.650> when<00:04:44.680> something<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
problem occurs when something like the

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.080 
problem occurs when something like the
following<00:04:45.940> happens<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.650> next<00:04:47.860> server<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.520> DNS

this<00:04:53.320> becomes<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.830> problem<00:04:54.010> because<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.940> last
