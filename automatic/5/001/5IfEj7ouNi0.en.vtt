00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 Hello dear friends with you andrew 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.020
 15 and a new rubric in which I will 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.449
 talk about this mode of battle as 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 team battle team battle is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 equivalent but tournament format 742 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.460
 which has long existed in the world tank 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.420
 Well, actually in this category, I will 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 talk about different tanks that 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.440
 participate in this format 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 and also about their application well and a little 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 I will touch on tactics on different maps and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 now we have a map of triplets we berg 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 we have a top spawn and a setchik 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.730
 two from third once nine 1390 and 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.879
 50100 took only one battle 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 one since 2 it is not installed 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.109
 get well nothing scary and so 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.809
 actually what are we going to do well 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.000
 the opponent is a heavier setup so 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.369
 if we follow the standard on the center 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 and try to shoot us something just 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.460
 crush it up doing yourself a fool with that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.619
 upper respa what we will do now 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 Firstly, I throw in the chat link to stream 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.350
 because we will accept someone given 742 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 farm every almost that evening on the channel 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 on which I 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.650
 well which channel link to channel i 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 threw in the description of the video every night 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.570
 somewhere from 9 to 12 we are going to age well 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.409
 and actually what we do two 50100 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.650
 chips 169 occupy 7 8 squares 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.900
 you become the first city in the lumen 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.470
 devyanostika gives glare of the central and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.450
 triples are pressed under the small town why 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.540
 this is done in order to first 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.670
 about the control of everything going there well 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.880
 at least try though the threes are simple and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.870
 have a bad time but 2 so worth it here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.180
 so that when they roll out the exit to 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.510
 triples i.e. triples give way to say 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.070
 deceived people roll out on droid we 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.310
 keep the drums take 5 pax good at 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.090
 Tournament format metro-2 that its pray 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 but at the same time she can wear for short 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.160
 time is big enough at home and not bad 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.460
 chooses the wrong one not to finish ie we are here 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.740
 weaved 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.810
 unfortunately I used to walk 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.530
 ruler and begin to give second 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.440
 drum once outfit you outfit a pair of hands 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.520
 a drum go for only 2 seconds is 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.630
 very little well or you can go 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.320
 take the goods and lock as here 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.560
 five hundred six hundred 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.720
 shot quickly so one thing didn't pass 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.510
 rule and here is the beat of the drums 1000 hp 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.500
 very bad result but still 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.730
 basic rule for playing on 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.170
 drummers this is a shot breaking through 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.950
 accordingly, I don’t have much 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.040
 well implement let's see what 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.519
 we turned out rolling out 6 nozzles 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.489
 triples 1 already gone hangar here it stands 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 the second trio is now also gone hangar well 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.790
 Still, she is still alive, we 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.950
 staying 2 2 8 lessons 4 eight- 2 2 in 4 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.410
 this is a very very very bad result and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.269
 actually 1311 insisted well 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.459
 shining but now shining in 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.280
 Basically, I do not know for sure this is a triple 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.010
 This is my light or light after all 1 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.810
 or all 100 well, I don `t know the principle, he us 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.400
 something here highlights it control from 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.070
 wife city so no one there 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 arrived but when our threes 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.190
 discharged clear in threes 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.970
 drove two 50100 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.070
 gobble up there and pick up 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.140
 our triples almost with impunity 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.440
 now our five hundred is discharged by 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.420
 threes and my roll out 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.880
 and trying to do something although we still have 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.360
 Come on, you give nine only 25 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.270
 very few seconds 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.370
 my body blind threw but do not know hit 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.880
 did not get more likely all got there because 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.040
 was pretty well visible silhouette 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.290
 the tank so have a chance to hit it was juicy 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.970
 a piece now we do that all 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.310
 recharge opening and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.660
 frequencies and we let you forward first and 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.210
 rolled let's finish borrow 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.800
 defensive position from the city because 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.990
 that we don’t stay here 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.180
 meaning will come from one side of the troika 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.300
 with the second one hundred and meet 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.630
 parties will be so he also us for sure 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.850
 pipets see that threesome looking here she 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.070
 straight look at me not write 100 a 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.270
 I understand exactly what you want now 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:47.890
 shoot me like a woman, and she puts on 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:51.580
 Guslya leaves he ran out of shells 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.950
 and he pick up isa third 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.310
 a ram 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.020
 but filming yourself 227 tp unfortunately he 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.980
 overclocked too much and too 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.100
 many took off the halls of remains 250 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.590
 tons so what are we gonna do you first 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.980
 we are sent to capture in order 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.740
 to build a base and distract opponents 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.030
 here we are and at least one of them should 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.220
 will rely on for development and second 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.750
 the moment we become one there here 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.850
 another here in principle we are to each other 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.920
 we can cover each other 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.500
 I go out to try to enlighten 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.530
 view capture build those who 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.410
 there is a big mistake here 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.720
 they all saw you walk the city 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.640
 so the letters would not be pursed here 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.350
 to this house how did 2 all stock 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.230
 but everyone has their mistakes 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.600
 Good I would now recharge 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.870
 our five hundred little bit of hapnul but 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.840
 it does not matter is I to 6 as a strong 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.350
 the place is already -2 that is, no four left 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.900
 projectile 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.270
 I have almost charged only 12 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.400
 seconds left it you don't need to go 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.860
 go ahead and dance for me and 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.130
 pour houses in 50100 there are only 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.250
 only 1000 hp i will take it about 900 and 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.350
 it will be bad to take our team 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.920
 well we go out with this side 5 table 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.700
 control out of the other is 5 now we 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.370
 we do that here we go all 100 we 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.140
 and now look at us goes but we are with you 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.720
 let's not just become the board supplied 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.120
 neatly tanchik bard that is to 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.340
 our pierce he must get him here 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.070
 Here in this ulybochku snowfall parts of the tower 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.200
 let's say well, hitting the top of it 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.800
 most likely a high probability that 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.840
 there will be no penetration or ricochet he also 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.300
 can get on either pan ld 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.340
 or here it is farther with him too 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.410
 there will be a ricochet of priests here too 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.390
 will pass ricochet as a very large 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.529
 the angle here is respectively guslya too 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:58.629
 closes the pores a good part of the card 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:00.650
 we are annoyed that not to invite 100 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:04.130
 ricochet 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.690
 5-5 minus 3 projectiles oh sorry minus 3 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.040
 projectile all 100 respectively not 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.300
 1 1 remote control left 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:15.169
 he will not take away our 473 mustache five hundred 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.370
 Well, how do you go and picks 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.240
 quietly 50100 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.639
 Here is such a beautiful dynamic fight for everything 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.110
 Nine and a proper map ruinberg I 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.770

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.560
 liked 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.020
 I plan to do further like this 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.570
 parsing tournament format battles 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.680
 if you are interested and if you 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.870

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.419
 watch live stream almost 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:43.610
 every evening on the channel of the cloud but which I 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.220
