00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:17.039
 good afternoon, we are meeting you again 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.720
 our video shootings on trial 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.520
 radan rotator 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:30.990
 z2000 radan then z2000 and for 1000 and z3000 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.829
 fundamentally differ only twisting 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.649
 turning moment meet motors 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.719
 but the principle of constructive these turning 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.360
 the ultros is absolutely the same now we 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.570
 in order to make it easier to search 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 took with them a turning device 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.700
 z2000 the purpose of this event is to hold 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 rotary test on 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.520
 integrity of execution which has 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.789
 significant value in practice 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.289
 applying turning cult growth now we 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.109
 turn on the rotator 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.609
 I will water her imitate 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.319
 rain 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.950
 after that we will do another 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.109
 an experiment that while I keep silence 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:30.920
 let's go turn the swivel 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:30.920
 device and begins to actively water 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.830
 as you can see the rotator 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:52.250
 rotates no problem place surrenders 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.690
 order to the amount of water 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 spilled on the rotator 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 will see complemented by what figure i will 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.950
 much 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 so active it all works 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.180
 left 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.310
 mothers. 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.310
 arrange water bowl spit you loved 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 I work fine under the pouring 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.780
 by the rain 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.440
 so you can safely put this product 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.209
 on the roof and not be afraid for what you have 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.120
 there say and now we stop 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.720
 shooting and prepare the gate device 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.239
 for a new experiment 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.700
 which are cooler than mount 54 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:55.830
 I think we will move on to the experiment. 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 describe a4 or 68 is the immersion of the product 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.510
 water to a depth of 1 meter 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.600
 for a few seconds turning 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.450
 the device should work here is interesting 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.900
 what will come of it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 bye see you in a few seconds 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.590
 now we will do an experiment 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.900
 immersing this rotator 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.750
 fireplaces where the turning device in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.129
 a barrel of water as another of us 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.310
 there is no reservoir, then we will take this barrel 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:50.890
 swivel device 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:53.129
 heavy and immerse now try 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.129
 turn on 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.560
 where do they take it clean 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:24.030
 here andy is working underwater so 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:28.230
 trials drunk from the 8th mouth on 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.850
 the device withstood this very large 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.850
 achievement of our company 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:58.300
 as a form 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:00.360
 holes pouring water while 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:07.440
 PTZ device is working 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:16.599
 look at the story and turned off here 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:20.229
 showing perfectly on this our 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.199
 experiments with our turning 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.750
 device we finish waiting for you 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.460
 the following frames are accuracy tests and 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.099
 reference so far all on 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.900
 acquisition swivel device 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:38.650
 go to the site turn to turn to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.810
 point ru and w in turn to point ru 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.810
 waiting for you bye
