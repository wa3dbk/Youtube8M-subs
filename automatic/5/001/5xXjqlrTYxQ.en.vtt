00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
balanced characters and that's game

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.779 
balanced characters and that's game
all<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.289> there's<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.619> character<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.130> my

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
all right there's my character to my

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
all right there's my character to my
player<00:00:30.029> named<00:00:30.269> Chad<00:00:31.109> there<00:00:31.380> he's<00:00:31.529> playing

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
player named Chad there he's playing

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
player named Chad there he's playing
struggle<00:00:32.160> walks<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> Barbarian<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.719> fellow

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
struggle walks the Barbarian my fellow

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
struggle walks the Barbarian my fellow
player<00:00:34.230> Eric<00:00:34.559> Carles<00:00:34.980> playing<00:00:35.309> his<00:00:35.430> dagger<00:00:35.640> in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
player Eric Carles playing his dagger in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.750 
player Eric Carles playing his dagger in
the<00:00:36.180> elven<00:00:36.480> wage<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> basically<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> game

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the elven wage so basically how the game

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.020 
the elven wage so basically how the game
works

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
works

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.340 
works
so<00:00:39.930> each<00:00:40.260> game<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:40.710> four<00:00:40.980> themed<00:00:41.280> questions

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
so each game has four themed questions

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
so each game has four themed questions
so<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.559> four<00:00:43.800> piles<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.190> cards<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so it's just four piles of cards in a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
so it's just four piles of cards in a
cart<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> quest<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.920> always<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
cart so quest one will always be the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
cart so quest one will always be the
easiest<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.989> gets<00:00:52.140> harder<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> game<00:00:52.770> goes

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
easiest it gets harder as the game goes

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.580 
easiest it gets harder as the game goes
on<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:54.600> always<00:00:54.780> randomized<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
on it's always randomized so it's a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.360 
on it's always randomized so it's a
different<00:00:55.860> series<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.600> events<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> basically

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
different series of events so basically

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.970 
different series of events so basically
on<00:00:59.699> your<00:00:59.760> turn<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.410> pick<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> card

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
on your turn you just pick up a card

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
on your turn you just pick up a card
will<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.609> monster<00:01:03.059> under<00:01:03.510> saving

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
