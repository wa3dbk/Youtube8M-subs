00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.150
 bounty presents an ingredient to a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.860
 manjar boricua that has been a friend of a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.629
 ingredient to a nice delicacy because 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.309
 some some of the most dishes 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.679
 delicious Puerto Rican cuisine 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 arose from our ability to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 improvise of course is that only as 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 boricua and is that when inventing 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.870
 delicacy nobody beats the pretty 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 dish that we are going to cook today 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.160
 is a good example of this because it comes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 from the word mason that is 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 mason in which it is true that with 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179
 leftovers are practically being in a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 construction for example on a slab 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:38.219
 or for example, a block of that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 makes a work of art or power 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.879
 rebuild the one of some piece or something 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.620
 similar in the case in the kitchen 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.219
 what we do is that we have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 the arrocito of the day before already done like 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.670
 in the case of the white stream that we have 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 here and we have for example already the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.530
 beans or stewed pigeon peas and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.229
 we make this delight that you can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.780
 see here that she is drying well 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.090
 cool was going to be delicious rice 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.570
 posted man 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.150
 with gandules ok and we start quickly 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.780
 around here and you know a little bit of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.090
 oil to start sautéing 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 pretty high temperature and let's go with 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.210
 the chorizo ​​or chorizo ​​for the stew to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.040
 jaycee black clear that is generated 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.260
 then we also add it if you have 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.940
 by chance ham cooking you can 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.619
 add but if you do not have salmon from 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.520
 cook who opened ham of 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.530
 sandwich 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 when you offer them in a pan 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.670
 dear friends besides that we are 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.350

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720
 small squares and see what cockiness and 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.780
 We began to enhance the flavor because 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.460
 we are doubling and the show is 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.410
 here we remain clear with a little bit of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 little onions that are always in the fridge 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.310
 a little onion we also have 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.410
 stir-fry in the fridge and be add a 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.149
 amazing flavor remember that what 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.160
 we had the little white bear and now 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.410
 we add all this flavor and it's a 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.110
 delight and what happens when we have everything 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.000
 this referring here and we add it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.470
 then what is the stewed pigeon peas 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.710
 that all this liquid 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.900
 and it is getting inside the rice 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.330
 and the red one grabs this flavor and the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.340
 rice ma have posted delicious that this 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.410
 Once you will learn to do it and they will do it 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 in your house for all your family clear 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.840
 that if he says he did not know how to do it and if 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.490
 you also want at this moment there are people 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.080
 that likes people that I do not like in 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.750
 this case well I did it a little bit the ama 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 more classic you can add banana 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.490
 ripe minced inside and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.890
 that is in fact the moment now 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.690
 same to add the rice milestone let's go here 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.280
 with this amount that approximately 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.150
 we have a quarter pound of chorizo 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.340
 about three chairs 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.230
 can you add I would tell you about 4 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.940
 bucket is a little bit more to go 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.760
 Sure there and what we do that 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.709
 we started here to move it and now 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.700
 mix it with these ingredients and look 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.140
 how he fry up ok and jobo is that 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.450
 let's do that frying look how it 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.940
 mix with the chorizo ​​in love 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.000
 this taste and the time came 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.400
 of flavor here are these pigeons for 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.620
 example I did it with enough pumpkin 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.080
 because there I love the taste of 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.260
 pumpkin and while you are cooking it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.300
 it can be unmade already in the rice and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.060
 what remains the flavor and remains with a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.850
 incredible taste look at how it looks 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.950
 the pigeon peas in the zucchini mine 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.480
 with the same spoon we can go as 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.580
 that says for as much or we leave it thus 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.560
 but look quoted the van breaking her 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.310
 it is practically part of the sauce and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.590
 the taste is incredibly rich we are going to 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.040
 add a little bit of color 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.630
 we have here paprika paprika could be 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.850
 It is also associated if you wish 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.220
 I prefer to add paprika ok and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.900
 we are simply moving so that 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.360
 this goes cooking we go down 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.390
 temperature so that the liquid of the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.160
 pigeons go drying but obviously it 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.680
 I'm inside the rice and I'm left 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.650
 divine and at this moment we add a 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.960
 little bit of cilantro and just what 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.600
 we move we can cover 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.850
 and cook like this tapadito approximately 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.890
 for 5 minutes or we leave it uncovered 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.140
 until it gets closer and we have 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.730
