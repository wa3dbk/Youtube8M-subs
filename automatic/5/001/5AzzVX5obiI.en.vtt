and<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.719> anybody<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
and I don't think anybody really

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.359 
and I don't think anybody really
seriously<00:01:02.190> thought<00:01:02.850> about<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> takes<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
seriously thought about what it takes to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
seriously thought about what it takes to
accompany<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.640> sound<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.650> you're

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
accompany that sound because if you're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.030 
accompany that sound because if you're
in<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> sound<00:01:09.560> environment<00:01:10.560> you're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
in that sound environment you're

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
in that sound environment you're
probably<00:01:11.369> playing<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> well<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.110> case

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
probably playing in the well in my case

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
probably playing in the well in my case
anyway<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.310> trying<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> solve

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
anyway and this is I'm trying to solve

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
anyway and this is I'm trying to solve
my<00:01:16.130> particular<00:01:17.210> situation<00:01:18.500> sonically<00:01:19.500> and

that I know percussionists that are in a
similar<00:01:26.159> situation<00:01:26.340> where<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.409> would

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
similar situation where they would

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
similar situation where they would
complain<00:01:28.770> about<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.310> mean<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:30.000> having

complain about it I mean not not having

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
complain about it I mean not not having
a<00:01:30.479> sound<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.049> works<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
a sound that really works like that of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
a sound that really works like that of
course<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.579> always<00:01:32.790> find<00:01:33.119> something<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
course we always find something that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
course we always find something that
works<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> doctor<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
works and we doctor it up or you know

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
works and we doctor it up or you know
over<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> years<00:01:37.409> I've<00:01:37.799> gathered<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.340> few<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
over the years I've gathered a few that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
over the years I've gathered a few that
worked<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> used<00:01:39.360> some<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.409> use

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
worked and I used some of them to to use

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
worked and I used some of them to to use
as<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> starting<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> reference<00:01:42.180> but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
as a starting point as a reference but

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.130 
as a starting point as a reference but
in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> end<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:44.299> haptic<00:01:45.299> line<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.750> totally

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
in the end this haptic line is totally

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
in the end this haptic line is totally
unique<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:48.000> hear<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:50.430> sound

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
unique and you can hear that the sound

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.219 
unique and you can hear that the sound
opens<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.560> faster<00:01:52.560> than<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.829> normal<00:01:53.159> cymbal<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
opens up faster than a normal cymbal and

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
opens up faster than a normal cymbal and
decays<00:01:55.229> more<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> comes<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> fuller

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
decays more and so it comes to a fuller

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.270 
decays more and so it comes to a fuller
blossom<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.869> shorter<00:01:58.500> amount<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.799> time<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
blossom in a shorter amount of time and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.199 
blossom in a shorter amount of time and
dissipates<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.540 

and<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.600> ride<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:11.009> available

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and this is a ride that is not available

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.350 
and this is a ride that is not available
yet<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.290> I'm<00:02:13.290> assuming<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:14.069> most<00:02:14.520> hand

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
yet but I'm assuming that most hand

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.140 
yet but I'm assuming that most hand
percussion<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.140> some<00:02:16.380> point<00:02:16.910> might<00:02:17.910> want

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
percussion is at some point might want

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.730 
percussion is at some point might want
to<00:02:18.209> play<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> stick<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.170> even<00:02:19.590> these

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
to play with a stick and even these

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.699 
to play with a stick and even these
sound<00:02:20.070> fine<00:02:20.370> without<00:02:20.640> mallet<00:02:24.470> nice<00:02:25.470> what

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
sound fine without mallet nice what

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
sound fine without mallet nice what
sticks<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.130> well<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.370> don't<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.300> problem

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
sticks as well I don't have a problem

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:44.060 
sticks as well I don't have a problem
playing<00:02:27.959> any<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> them

will<00:06:32.679> because<00:06:33.459> that's<00:06:33.639> the<00:06:33.849> idea<00:06:34.209> that<00:06:34.509> they

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
will because that's the idea that they

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:38.249 
will because that's the idea that they
they<00:06:35.469> blossom<00:06:36.009> soon<00:06:36.249> and<00:06:36.489> they<00:06:36.579> died<00:06:36.819> fast<00:06:37.719> but

they blossom soon and they died fast but

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.499 
they blossom soon and they died fast but
in<00:06:38.499> the<00:06:38.649> end<00:06:38.799> it's<00:06:39.429> very<00:06:39.819> distinctive<00:06:40.269> num

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:40.509 
in the end it's very distinctive num

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.979 
in the end it's very distinctive num
no.2<00:06:41.019> will<00:06:41.469> sound<00:06:41.739> remotely<00:06:42.459> the<00:06:43.449> same<00:06:43.479> but

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:43.989 
no.2 will sound remotely the same but

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:46.619 
no.2 will sound remotely the same but
they're<00:06:44.139> in<00:06:44.319> character<00:06:44.799> with<00:06:45.069> the<00:06:45.189> line<00:06:45.599> so<00:06:46.599> I
