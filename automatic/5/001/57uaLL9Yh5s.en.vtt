 present an accessible game and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.140
 achievable by and for the whole family 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.870
 as its title indicates easy aces 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.390
 It is very easy to walk 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.410
 simple mathematical game of the most 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.620
 basic but you can make up to a 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.080
 6 year old boy 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.230
 it does not stop being that it obviously contains 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.020
 a great visual impact that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.810
 ignore and do not discover the trick there 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.420
 to be a bit rogue, obviously 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.580
 but the magic tool from a point 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.470
 already from a good beginning as well as not 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.930
 have a bit of mischief so you do not get 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.150
 catch is not bad to perform 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.340
 this game will use any kind of 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.530
 The exact same deck can be 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.770
 French deck can be deck 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.320
 Spanish but does not require 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.579
 a specific deck is to say that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.969
 forgiveness does not require 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.460
 a complete boat that you can use 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.670
 is done with a number of letters with 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.630
 lowest concrete I'm messing 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.490
 continued with the theme come generally 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 four aces 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.240
 because they tend to be the highest values ​​of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.120
 the French deck in a game of 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.310
 poker among the few not the play anymore 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.920
 high because the highest would be a 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.950
 ladder but in a game of four 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 letters as the poker of aces is the most 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.440
 high in the case of the Spanish charts 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 Well, I'm sure horses do not 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.870

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.720
 four cards four aces you can choose 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.560
 the aces like any other and three 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.160
 letters for each us or a total of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.290
 sixteen cards and the centuries or that the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.030
 letters are alive and those located in the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.800
 next way and it will show to

 let's place an ace 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.150
 with all clarity and distinction without doing 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.730

 no kind of concrete manipulation a 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.720
 little mischief of a certain point 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.790
 and that's it but sell as the motorcycle of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.159
 next way you tell your audience 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.109

 four heaps one two three four and 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.150
 when you are going to proceed with the next 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.400
 you stop for a moment while 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.819
 you hold the letter ribbon in your hand 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.799

 adm in favor of flipping it over and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.189
 check how true the fact 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.790

 will notice in that letter you will have 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.540
 done in the meantime he tells you what 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.459
 I just did a moment ago I had 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.379
 a letter to the hand and if you do it 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.909
 while you speak, taking into account that 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.280
 your audience will not see you through a 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.280
 camera 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.260
 but around you while you 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.420
 speak it is important to look in the eyes 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.480
 always your audience is also the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.390
 letters look at your eyes your gesture will be 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.280
 been to return the letter you had in 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.560
 your hands that came to the part 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.860
 top of the pile return it to the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.709
 bottom in this way if the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.910
 letters will be in this order 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.870
 obviously, there would still be 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.500
 same sequence every four letters 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.950
 but how did you retire without doing any 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.840
 mention class or what did you have 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.230
 a letter in your hand and you used it to 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.930
 of guide indicating when turning over 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.700
 this letter you indicate to your audience and 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.500
 when you do it with all the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.419
 tranquility natural and unloaded 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.620
 zeitún and return the letter to the fund of 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.229
 the deck you see that it is a very 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.660
 fast and immediate nobody will notice the 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.580
 detail maybe someone will see that you are carrying 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.710
 the hand to the pile and then the letter 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.750
 to empty it because the letters will touch 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.790
 you will teach the following because then 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.160
 that letter bothers your hands 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.260
 do not say anything about it, do this 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.930
 you say all right all perfect normal 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.760
 we continue with the process that happens 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.770
 that we have altered the order of 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.900
 letters obviously now we do not have 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.850
 every four letters one because we have 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.210
 retired the mathematical upper letter 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.550
 pure and simple is simple and basic 1 2 3 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.250
 is an ace therefore when you do 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.140
 one two three these are like that four but 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:21.710
 will indicate if you public one two three days 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.330
 one two three days and about 23 aunts 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.830
 you say we have here the four aces as 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.960
 we have been able to check and flip this 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.090
 letter and other letters are what you 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.310
 you turn this letter you say but we are going to 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.710
 make a magical pass you take the asylum if 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.750
 you are here with those who are 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.330
 you do and your audience does not know and there's the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.910
 put here and tell them this or 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.130
 any other reason the aces are very 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.740
 whimsical and where you go one goes 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.270
 all magical click pass and they 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.550
 you indicate the aces were here 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.190
 magically we have moved them now 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.310
 that are no longer there and happen to be next to 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.890
 plus 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.710
 that was initially shown game 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.260
 completed basic simple and 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.770
 shocking for the whole family 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.450
 if you are interested in getting started in magic 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:12.560
 this is one of the games that you can 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:15.950
 use and you will check the benefits 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.220
 of art if you already know it and you are 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.600
 usual so do not hesitate to use it for 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.430
 very simple that is because I 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.350
 I personally do it and follow 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.940
 surprising my audience I hope that you 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.130
 I liked that you give it a good use 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.130
 thank you very much and until the next video
