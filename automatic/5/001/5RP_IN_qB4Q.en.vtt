with my sister to do this one but and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.020 
with my sister to do this one but and
I'll<00:01:57.000> test<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:57.990> first<00:01:58.979> -<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.909> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I'll test it out first - we could do it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
I'll test it out first - we could do it
on<00:02:00.119> our<00:02:00.240> nails<00:02:00.420> today<00:02:00.780> cuz<00:02:01.079> they're<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> little

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
on our nails today cuz they're a little

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
on our nails today cuz they're a little
bit<00:02:01.740> sharp<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:03.770> but<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.100> basically<00:02:05.280> stick

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
bit sharp right but you basically stick

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.510 
bit sharp right but you basically stick
their<00:02:06.570> claw<00:02:06.899> into<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:08.069> hole<00:02:08.190> right

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
their claw into that little hole right

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.780 
their claw into that little hole right
here<00:02:09.330> hold<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:10.099> into<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> hole<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.730> there

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
here hold on into the hole right there

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.540 
here hold on into the hole right there
so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.480 
so
like<00:02:13.350> human<00:02:14.350> nail<00:02:14.590> clippers<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:16.060> size

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
like human nail clippers and this size

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.990 
like human nail clippers and this size
but<00:02:18.490> what<00:02:18.760> happens<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.260> helps<00:02:20.710> not<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.370> cut

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
but what happens is it helps not to cut

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.820 
but what happens is it helps not to cut
off<00:02:22.150> their<00:02:22.480> quick<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.610> insert<00:02:25.120> each<00:02:25.830> or

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
off their quick so you insert each or

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.620 
off their quick so you insert each or
insert<00:02:27.220> tip<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.610> each<00:02:27.700> claw<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.390> guard

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
insert tip of each claw into the guard

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.810 
insert tip of each claw into the guard

of<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.680> ragdolls<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.580> know<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
of the ragdolls that I know and I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.110 
to make sure but I think that this our
first<00:03:47.080> go<00:03:47.350> around<00:03:47.530> might<00:03:47.950> be<00:03:48.130> better<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:48.459> like

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
first go around might be better for like

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.240 
first go around might be better for like
