00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:40.170 

I<00:02:37.890> think<00:02:38.890> she'll<00:02:39.130> use<00:02:39.340> dance<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:40.030> it's

I think she'll use dance when it's
necessary<00:02:40.360> she<00:02:41.020> lose<00:02:41.200> drama<00:02:41.560> Missy<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.340> don't

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
necessary she lose drama Missy I don't

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.000 
necessary she lose drama Missy I don't
think<00:02:42.850> she<00:02:43.060> has<00:02:43.690> quite<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:43.990> one-track<00:02:44.620> mind

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
think she has quite the one-track mind

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.820 
think she has quite the one-track mind
on<00:02:45.280> dancer<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.940> hope<00:02:46.360> she<00:02:46.840> has<00:02:47.200> also<00:02:47.650> her

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
on dancer I hope she has also her

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.700 
on dancer I hope she has also her
father's<00:02:48.310> idea<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.120> development<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.680> I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
father's idea of development and so I

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.110 
father's idea of development and so I
think<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.720> say<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.230> think<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.590> enriched<00:02:54.160> it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
think as I say I think it's enriched it

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.960 
think as I say I think it's enriched it
may<00:02:55.300> not<00:02:55.450> be<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> dance<00:02:56.020> form<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.640> think

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
may not be a dance form but I think

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.570 
may not be a dance form but I think
everything<00:02:58.480> she<00:02:58.720> uses<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.710> help<00:02:59.950> us<00:03:00.160> uses

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
everything she uses to help us uses

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.690 
everything she uses to help us uses
drama<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.210> great<00:03:01.510> deal<00:03:02.160> sometimes<00:03:03.160> even<00:03:03.520> more

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
drama a great deal sometimes even more

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.610 
drama a great deal sometimes even more
than<00:03:03.940> done<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.510> think<00:03:04.630> she<00:03:04.960> would<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.350> use

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
than done so I think she would just use

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:27.620 
than done so I think she would just use
the<00:03:05.890> arts<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.850> her<00:03:07.000> background
