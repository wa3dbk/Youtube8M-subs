00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello there not a whole 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.509
 accidentally discovered that I did not record 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:13.969
 video review on this mini for now 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:16.590
 mx key with 85 on the processor to magic s800 5 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.920
 so let's have a talk now 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.930
 for not a minute is made in the form factor as the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.449
 paragraph kind is the same small 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.789
 square has two full-size 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 enter and beat one size from the game also 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.180
 you can through here and so the cable 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 use as for what connection 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 either devices connector for 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 micro sd card full ethernet 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.820
 orders and exit from pdf exit is exit to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.460
 you output it like a pancake optical output 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.719
 sound to your music system jack 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.399
 for audio video output 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.820
 through a specific adapter here you can 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.159
 connect old TVs 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.040
 Well, very convenient in principle, and a connector for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.439
 no power connections 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 there are no connectors except this one 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.760
 buttons button to be honest I donâ€™t 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 like absolutely not like on that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.299
 sense that she's some kind of ancient not 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.850
 think that this is some kind of antiquity and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.790
 god not only that when you press not 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 we can not understand whether you clicked 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 whether the sanatorium has clicked it slammed 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 the benefit here is such an LED 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.869
 which shows in working condition 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 or sleep state other than quad 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 logic here is 1 gigabyte 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.369
 RAM and 8 GB internal 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.710
 memory in principle for full work 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.479
 quite enough processor we have built 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.000
 on cortex a5 chip with 1 and 5 gigahertz 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.780
 4 processor clean 4 cores roughly 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.930
 more precisely they are processor and mali 450 in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 pretty good combination 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.220
 iron is also here and wifi and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.410
 bluetooth seems to me no but it's in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.240
 principle is enough for normal 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.020
 work for pro 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.770
 microfilm video over the internet through 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.420
 network or flash drives for example 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 Also included is such a remote control 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.370
 but to be honest I was skeptical 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.480
 so remote like that but uncomfortable 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.570
 if you look through the shell hash 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.790
 beyonce seems so it is called that 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.580
 less somehow conveniently controlled and 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.150
 but more if you put the shell off 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 android 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.370
 but it is completely almost useless antutu 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.190
 benchmark scored 16 thousand eight hundred 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.590
 twenty six points 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.260
 the number is quite low but justified 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.660
 the fact that the resolution of 1920 to 1080 that is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.540
 full and view resolution for this test 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.520
 that, in principle, not bad until the epic 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.820
 citadel meaning i would say a couple 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.480
 words still about him until this mini 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.250
 mini bye 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.830
 really liked him enough 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.080
 compact and comfortable no with him 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.620
 I was the only problem 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.650
 reflash it for firmware older 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.960
 that by the way I advise you anyway 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.710
 stability is improved and the opportunity 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.210
 the loader does not select 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.730
 The standard loader does not like very much 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.470
 He certainly sharpened by this remote but me 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.930
 i don't like i am flashing and there is 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.150
 possibility to choose another standard 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.070
 bootloader where I quietly plug the mouse 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.620
 and watch my favorite movies 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.340
 I do n't play this mini for now but because 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.470
 What processor and clearly Malinche to 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.800
 speed but not that but to work with 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.530
 Internet with watching movies from the network 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.020
 from film views over the ball from your 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.500
 computer is generally an ideal machine 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.830
 it did not glitch did not brake did not hang not 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.680
 was losing the network everything is just great so 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.170
 epic citadel and we scored 26 and 3 fps 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.270
 at 1920 resolution at 1080 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.910
 high quality well, that's more to me 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.080
 principle nothing to add nothing to say 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.740
 great machine 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.750
 I repeat it again 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.490
 subscribe to my video channel put 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.490
 thumb up bye guys
