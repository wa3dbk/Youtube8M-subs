00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.860
 conquer beautiful boys are power here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 today I'll show a bitter what 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.160
 I think it is one of the most difficult of the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 more difficult 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.010
 few know I'll see how 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.170
 defend the stations in this case 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.129
 on yemen 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.420
 then first let's talk about the 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.520
 location has to do with the central position 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's his key song but not for i 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.449
 points because this strictly 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.850
 location is left out by all 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.589
 so players are looking for this one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.080
 position to gain the shore for 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.750
 the vote after that tree house o 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.729
 I don't know how you want to call it 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.440
 anyway just to do the thing 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.780
 best to do is run all together 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 from the left side going here while 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.110
 some people contend for those who 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.059
 they run from here from the left side yes 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.489
 they will find the enemies that we are born this 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 then I left first 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.799
 so first you need to have one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
 person maybe here or even here that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.760
 at the beginning you try to kill 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 opening to then try to climb on 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.719
 for this or for the viola delle 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 so scales the other players purple 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.130
 instead they will be with the area or 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.380
 here they will have to look for pusher instead 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.729
 then localized extrusion to go 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.289
 to take the spawn for the next one 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.640
 stationary position from here is more 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.579
 Defensible you can make points 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 staying here a secret now I will tell you then 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.359
 first if you are here where 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 it's me you can see the enemies that are 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.170
 on the other side if it was set up 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.109
 second thing was and hoping here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.570
 I don't die doing it I didn't lay down not 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.090
 I know why you want to state e 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.469
 here now I can't let you see it though 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.759
 staying here maybe with a smoke bomb 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.399
 thrown your left you are 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 practically invisible to the enemy 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.210
 therefore also this reason showing 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.640
 if you are inside half body 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 with this rock here I fell alone 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.359
 fortissimo 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.159
 Seriously then anyway 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.600
 this is the best way to defend it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.880
 because then once taken this with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.319
 this piece of post here where I am 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.600
 I find it easy to defend 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.970
 of water because you can see the enemies and 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.170
 turn away to see if anyone step now 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.650
 let's move on to my second location 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.349
 I recommend having a person so now 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.730
 and one here maybe because those in 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.829
 race can see the people going up 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.180
 trying to climb on and then the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.980
 next post, however, to cover 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.360
 purple scales so avoid that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 take this area this is an area 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.629
 of main spawn because you are 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 very close to the people you meet 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.700
 will find here will do a function let's say 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.470
 back up ie if someone dies 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
 he must take over better and better 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.799
 this case mr because the other two 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.510
 players will find one in here 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.609
 where my advice for staying in here 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.829
 and don't stay here like everyone else does 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.200
 some which will pit the wall grilles 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.310
 there is to stay or so because this is possible 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.409
 see if people come from the ho here and 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.720
 let's say you don't notice it because it's all black 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.730
 so maybe in these places or lying down 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.439
 here, however, this is the other version 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.090
 instead below you can stay in 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.189
 different places can stay here that way 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.519
 you can see if anyone can 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.859
 stay here hidden and there are so many places 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.599
 or only up here so as to 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.069
 do so left left so a 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.720
 turn around like this ask the companion 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.069
 who stands above or look at my left 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.470
 when there is someone and the outgoing nanny 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.540
 glossy palalido returns above this one 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.769
 it is our vision of location we are at 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.810
 third the third vegetable is very difficult 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.340
 because first thing they will answer me 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.530
 almost always to advise me to have 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.780
 a person above here I have 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.040
 above is hidden here in the corner here 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.400
 in the end even in here that is where 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.049
 count that I can't get up 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.959
 there are places like being at the ace for 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.639
 pictured above house in here so I 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.129
 here they are useful because you IPAI minds we 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.389
 pass in front could kill itself 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.949
 what if you want to stay inside 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.549
 of the house are people who do this 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:01.129
 for example, however, the person 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.379
 obviously in the other one 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 person who can stay in here 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.569
 so and if the person on the right looks at the 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.139
 Central stairs can easily do 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.790
 this look here if anyone is there 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.159
 maybe to help the left one 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.780
 however, if that is on the right 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.699
 he says they are born again but need not 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.019
 it is better to remain still here like this 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.300
 be careful because people can climb over 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.070
 jumping from the bypass is of acqui 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.139
 localized station the third version 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.720
 instead jolly functions can stand 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.250
 practically everywhere but also to stay 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.080
 from here to wait like a fool 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.050
 just the passers by everyone and the other 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.060
 in one we talk about looking for posts 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.760
 I think the hardest is usually 35 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.820
 seconds I recommend you to rotate but for 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.830
 rotate I intend to take you to the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.150
 location and leave this you can 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.030
 give away points of vegetables because 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.950
 usually church are free points 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.570
 I always recommend having it at the beginning 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.400
 of rotation a person water because 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.080
 can do spawn killah who corrects from 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.710
 purple and those that pass to the strings 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.290
 but to defend ok one or two 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.090
 people inside 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.220
 I remember if you lie down like that 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.440
 people will not see you when they jump and you 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.240
 you will be able to raise a person to shoot him 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.250
 maybe here as I am that same thing 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.190
 you can't see it or don't know it in here 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.160
 there are so many corners to put oneself into 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.320
 the person up there who is always helpful is 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.400
 a person maybe back here because 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.200
 I say a person like why this 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.060
 person can do then do here post 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.190
 here where I am now see if there is 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.990
 some enemy is still holding the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.760
 left the person behind can 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.350
 as well move or come near here 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.090
 that other instead of helping him and can 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.210
 staying here must always be waiting 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.740
 anyway to this place to the alley already 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.140
 left here in the center finally i 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.060
 Enemies are easily scalable 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.410
 the combined use however 3 smg because 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.770
 in the end, the more you have the more there is 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.210
 easy to defend only 60 free points 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.750
 but let's move on to the last station 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.060
 that of statue then this 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.370
 location is very particular not there 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.720
 truth one own shore hold mine 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.000
 council tries to make the enemies break through 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.320
 may right always better to have one 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.660
 person quacks because because from here one 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.520
 can hide in a house sees i 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.130
 enemies if they go to the center and then 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.750
 also know if they are behind why 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.120
 enemies remained of water from the per 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.830
 change the spawn a person in purple 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.330
 but this person must be 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.860
 it depends first of all on the weapon being one 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.390
 r should stay so look for 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.070
 kill the enemies that pass to go 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.890
 above change the spawn or center 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.450
 we are smg to clone you can put it here 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.580
 how i got it now i don't 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.620
 will see this summer if you stay like this 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.120
 instead you see instead if you are like 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.320
 I am now I do not see you 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.960
 or on the other the Rome does not change 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.259
 anything 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.419
 and to be able to kill those who climb over 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.520
 instead it was another person's advice 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.250
 stay here behind maybe as many chips or 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.569
 take advantage of this state as you see 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.039
 you can see the enemies on the other 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.139
 beware that you see where to use it 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.150
 well this we say this shelter or 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.849
 here are so many states they can hide 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.490
 beware of the barrel, die there, please 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.620
 and a fourth version that could stand 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.270
 also in the tree house or simply 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.160
 asserting in the post because they are enemies 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.380
 they arrive alone anyway it is always 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.169
 better check if it is tree house and 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.539
 be over the enemies they will marry where there 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:15.380
 there is a sort of arch on the left not 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:17.240
 I'll show you a second is not 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.210
 quite as simple as what i hope 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.800
 help you anyway tried to 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.690
 explain as precisely as possible 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.720
 since this we say this kind of 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.439
 location on yemen 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.789
 location setting in time 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.159
 this is the game mode 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.539
 location on yemen is very difficult there 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.400
 they are a theme that they sometimes play with 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:36.110
 however all depends on what 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.729
 type of network game to do contain 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.349
 say that you play mainly for 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:41.689
 cut out the enemies ie kill them 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:44.539
 from afar with smg means that 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:46.939
 play to stay more around the o 

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:49.729
 the inside so it's a kind of game 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:51.740
 different 2 r2 smg instead the classic 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.180
 anyway pretty girl next video 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.009
 which instead will be like breaking this 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.580
 time I wanted to break the posts 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:58.009
 nintendo 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.150
 nine balls I hope that there has 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:01.759
 broke the balls though this video 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.259
 anyway and I wanted to change wanted 

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:05.479
 put the defense first because many me 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.840
 they asked her how to defend Yemen 

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:10.729
 since they are really in trouble 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.050
 then I will also make the video on how to rom for 

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:14.050
