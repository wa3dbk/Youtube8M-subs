00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
like the world's ended how do we

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.790 
like the world's ended how do we
remember<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> tragedy<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.590> magnitude

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.249 

eight<00:00:26.800> thousand<00:00:27.400> people<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.849> day<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.960> tall

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
eight thousand people a day is the tall

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.560 
eight thousand people a day is the tall
that<00:00:29.589> means<00:00:29.800> takes<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:30.939> world

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
that means takes in this world

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.830 
that means takes in this world
I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.980> counter<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:34.059> is<00:00:34.570> an

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
I think the counter to that is an

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.729 
I think the counter to that is an
expression<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.800> life<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:37.180> can<00:00:37.480> we<00:00:37.719> do<00:00:38.050> there

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
expression of life what can we do there

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.119 
expression of life what can we do there
was<00:00:38.949> no<00:00:39.219> one<00:00:39.519> central<00:00:40.180> place<00:00:40.449> where<00:00:41.050> all<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.949> us
