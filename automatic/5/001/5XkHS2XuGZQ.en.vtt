just the keys the asus zenfone 5 means

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.050 
just the keys the asus zenfone 5 means
in<00:03:55.000> this<00:03:55.120> factor<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.290> let's<00:03:56.669> put<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:57.790> screen

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
in this factor so let's put the screen

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.030 
in this factor so let's put the screen
size<00:03:58.329> into<00:03:58.630> test<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.500> as<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.739> see<00:03:59.889> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
size into test so as you see the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.430 
size into test so as you see the
comparison<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:01.090> phone<00:04:01.720> is

the zenfone 5 is a little bit larger

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.920 
the zenfone 5 is a little bit larger
than<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.660> redmi<00:04:05.230> 1s<00:04:05.490> which<00:04:06.490> is<00:04:06.640> also<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:07.750> little

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
than the redmi 1s which is also a little

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.400 
than the redmi 1s which is also a little
bit<00:04:08.820> critical<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:10.210> hold<00:04:10.420> in<00:04:10.600> your<00:04:10.660> single<00:04:11.230> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
place it in my hand it's a even for my

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.600 
place it in my hand it's a even for my
and<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.299> too<00:04:19.660> big<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.890> can't<00:04:20.920> able<00:04:21.489> to

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
and it's too big that I can't able to

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.270 
and it's too big that I can't able to
reach<00:04:21.820> from<00:04:22.480> top<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.900> bottom<00:04:23.170> in<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.770> single

reach from top to bottom in a single

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.250 
reach from top to bottom in a single
time<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:25.030> will<00:04:25.180> be<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.390> little<00:04:25.780> bit<00:04:25.990> leave<00:04:26.230> a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
55 inch screen the zenfone 5 and while

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.880 
55 inch screen the zenfone 5 and while
comparing<00:04:48.250> with<00:04:48.490> redmi<00:04:49.120> 1s<00:04:49.150> in<00:04:49.660> which<00:04:49.810> has<00:04:49.990> 4.7

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
comparing with redmi 1s in which has 4.7

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.990 
comparing with redmi 1s in which has 4.7
inch<00:04:51.040> screen<00:04:51.360> according<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.390> my<00:04:52.800> usage<00:04:53.850> 4.7<00:04:54.850> is

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
inch screen according to my usage 4.7 is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.250 
inch screen according to my usage 4.7 is
very<00:04:55.900> good<00:04:56.140> for<00:04:56.730> every<00:04:57.730> small<00:04:58.690> run<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.050> launch

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
very good for every small run and launch

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.770 
very good for every small run and launch
large<00:04:59.650> and<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.890> uses<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.880> fits<00:05:01.090> in<00:05:01.270> every<00:05:01.630> end

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
large and it uses it fits in every end

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.370 
large and it uses it fits in every end
so<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.500> maximum<00:05:03.720> inch<00:05:04.720> screen<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.260> you

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
so the maximum inch screen that you

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.740 
so the maximum inch screen that you
could<00:05:05.560> opt<00:05:05.770> for<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> 4.7<00:05:07.090> inch<00:05:07.210> according<00:05:07.630> to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
could opt for is a 4.7 inch according to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.550 
could opt for is a 4.7 inch according to
my<00:05:08.140> experience<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:10.330> zenfone<00:05:10.570> 5<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.110> little

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
my experience so the zenfone 5 is little

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.580 
my experience so the zenfone 5 is little
bit<00:05:11.680> bigger<00:05:11.919> but<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:13.270> point<00:05:13.510> 3<00:05:13.690> difference

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
bit bigger but the point 3 difference

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.550 
bit bigger but the point 3 difference
doesn't<00:05:14.890> make<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.370> too<00:05:15.790> big<00:05:15.820> but<00:05:16.510> while<00:05:17.380> using

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
doesn't make it too big but while using

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.409 
doesn't make it too big but while using
it<00:05:17.830> in<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.040> day-to-day<00:05:18.340> usage<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:19.060> will<00:05:19.240> feel

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
it in a day-to-day usage you will feel

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.990

that<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:20.290> zenfone<00:05:20.500> 5<00:05:20.800> fail<00:05:21.160> use<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.370> little<00:05:21.850> bit

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
that the zenfone 5 fail use a little bit

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.940 
that the zenfone 5 fail use a little bit
bigger<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.820> that's<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:25.690> from<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:25.990> size<00:05:26.169> so

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
bigger so that's it but from the size so

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.010
