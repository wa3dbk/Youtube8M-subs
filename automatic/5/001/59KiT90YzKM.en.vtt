00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.659
 the last one on the nonsense chatelaine today I you 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.020
 presents the recipe of zucchini fundamental goat cheese 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.260
 so it's a really easy recipe to make beautiful 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.809
 so for starters you need three for medium sized ginette 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.539
 video 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.130
 so it's important to take good zucchini so that the market 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 or zucchini hard because you will see they will stay firmer 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.070
 to make you a lot less water 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 that zucchini that you bought late of lower quality 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.900
 in their eyes not that you wash your zucchini well under cold water 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.370
 we cut them in the direction of the length of course you remove them 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.910
 ends and then promise you the first slice and bourgoin have cut 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.319
 in length 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.319
 and after you make pieces here it's made small triangles 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.300
 so pretty much 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 one centimeter thick to one more step 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.390
 a little too late 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
 all the big west with further you will go 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.760
 then you do the same with the other two projects cut out towers 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.840
 and then we put them aside you book and you take your little 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.350
 scale of fresh goat so here this movie is really fresh goat cheese 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.180
 but you can also use it for this recipe 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.880
 l 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.469
 the goat and who has his little one for sweetness up to 30 years this call to the 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.970
 goat's scalp head ac the skin of sweetness 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.390
 so - cut out a few centimeters 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600
 dtc so even if it's difficult 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 if this case it does not matter because after you have talents 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.429
 m 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.330
 it does not matter 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.760
 you then take a small skillet and you put especially strong to 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.570
 to do well fresh for small bacon 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.179
 but at least I took shares in the bezel that are not smoking 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.749
 so you can take classic orders or smoked bacon 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.719
 sit down it's you who see but especially not to add salt because 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.780
 that there are tears that are salty and all so I'm going to add broth 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 vegetable rapunzel that already contains a little bit of salt 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:18.120
 so how can he ardon are ready you can add at that moment the 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.269
 small zucchini previously cut and 1 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.999
 at that time a beautiful down fire because we have to get to do 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:25.700
 go out 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.980
 during zucchini 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 so if it's a little messed by caramelized and there is no purpose 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.400
 because the goal is first of all to bring out a little bit of 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.049
 broth 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.989
 you mix so a little near 3 4 minutes for well beautiful angie is 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.989
 Sealed these small bacon onions with zucchini 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.999
 at that moment you have 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.189
 and take cover while it's over for a quarter of an hour twenty minutes we're going 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.299
 say 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.310
 so it's important to watch carefully it's him who needs this young person 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.190
 stand out 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.650
 so there you see bottled meteonews 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.069
 we can see that he has 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069
 link langguth mulot came out of the zucchini 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.700
 then you have enough juice to throw a little 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.450
 half zen 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.459
 vegetable broth job 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.699
 he 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 enough to shoot this caught the broth 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
 so at least a few minutes to five or six soldiers 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.490
 you see the Lorraine broth has practically disappeared so now the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.260
 zucchini on the right a little bit golden caramelized but not too 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.339
 there you will be able to deposit the small washers of goat debuchy 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.709
 fresh 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.709
 - of course distribute all the 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.079
 for it to be well balanced and after you go put the cover yourself 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.049
 cover 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.260
 we love 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.899
 three minutes for the goat 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.900
 it's a real show like that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 thank you for using 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.489
 servette they know how to melt a lot more that it's going to spread well in 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.289
 pan 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.509
 with that one so much less but it's just as good 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.790
 so to accompany these little zucchini you can serve a good 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.769
 slice of ham with sauce or if you prefer fish to steam 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.729
