00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.609

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.070
 from us arabic and english so one 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.399
 a bit mixed yes I try my 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.600
 Best fight on and I try 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.890
 hope to see you at the end of the year 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.179
 get out and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.679
 that will be in Arabic English times 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.359

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:23.009
 this goal has now hit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.689
 yes my mother tongue Arabic and that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.009
 my idea was people said once 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 Come sing a bit oriental 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.360
 because I can sing and Arabic 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.399
 singing can make a deal 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.119
 mixture of english arab april 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.189
 get well done then and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.780
 hopefully want what one says yes times 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.659
 chain this typical question has something 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 inspired you what the Arab singer 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.810
 or so does not inspire what sir 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.700
 For example, a student like that personally 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 Arabic music that's what you know 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.310
 well I think that's cool you are you doing in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140
 the style of music what you what window 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.849
 yet suitable for your album if it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 would come out as the German again 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.500
 In any case, also in the direction of Seoul 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.810
