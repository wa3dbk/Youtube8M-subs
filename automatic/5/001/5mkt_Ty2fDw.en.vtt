Andre will you sleep tonight where did
that<00:00:02.250> come<00:00:02.429> from<00:00:03.020> well<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.049> think<00:00:04.670> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
that come from well I think the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.870 
that come from well I think the
difficult<00:00:06.150> start<00:00:06.390> for<00:00:06.569> us<00:00:07.189> obviously<00:00:08.189> after

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
difficult start for us obviously after

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360 
difficult start for us obviously after
after<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> start<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.889> know<00:00:11.010> you're

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
after a start like this you know you're

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.789 
after a start like this you know you're
everything<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.150> had<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.389> mind<00:00:12.650> to<00:00:13.650> go

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
everything that you had in mind to go

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.720 
everything that you had in mind to go
past<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.790> game<00:00:15.080> because<00:00:16.080> down<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:16.980> drain<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
past this game because down the drain so

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.830 
past this game because down the drain so
it<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:19.350> difficult<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.830> us<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.510> start<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it was difficult for us to start in this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.109 
it was difficult for us to start in this
fashion<00:00:22.220> there's<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> lot<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> positives

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
fashion there's not a lot of positives

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.250 
fashion there's not a lot of positives
for<00:00:24.240> us<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.570> back<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.019> game<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
for us to look back into a game like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.029 
for us to look back into a game like
this<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:27.539> spell<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.529> reaction

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
this we got a good spell of reaction

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.380 
this we got a good spell of reaction
just<00:00:29.970> after<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.449> suffered<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:32.030> you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
just after we suffered but you know the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
just after we suffered but you know the
tune<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> three<00:00:34.920> Neal<00:00:35.130> everything

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
tune of the three Neal everything

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.780 
tune of the three Neal everything
happened<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:37.020> quickly<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.950> never<00:00:38.129> we

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
happened so so quickly you never we

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
happened so so quickly you never we
never<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> chance<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.719> back<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
never got a chance to get back into the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.580 
never got a chance to get back into the
game

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
game

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.170 
game
our<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.760> only<00:00:41.969> chance<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:43.070> those

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
our probably only chance was those

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
our probably only chance was those
chances<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:45.960> half

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
chances that we had in the first half

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
chances that we had in the first half
you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> goes<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you know if it goes to one one is a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
you know if it goes to one one is a
different<00:00:50.100> game<00:00:50.250> when<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.940> goes<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.420> nil

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
different game when it goes to two nil

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.950 
different game when it goes to two nil
and<00:00:51.719> three<00:00:51.960> nil<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:54.030> makes<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> very<00:00:54.840> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and three nil it makes it very very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
and three nil it makes it very very
difficult<00:00:55.370> obviously<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:57.000> do

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
difficult obviously you can't do

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.400 
difficult obviously you can't do
anything<00:00:57.270> about<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.899> goal<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
anything about a first goal like that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.479 
anything about a first goal like that
but<00:00:58.770> would<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.250> done<00:00:59.399> anything

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
but would you have done anything

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
but would you have done anything
differently<00:00:59.820> could<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.629> done<00:01:00.750> anything

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
differently could you have done anything

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.060 
differently could you have done anything
differently<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> went<00:01:01.739> home<00:01:04.070> it's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
differently as it went home it's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
differently as it went home it's
difficult<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.360> believe<00:01:06.689> get

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
difficult because you don't believe get

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.649 
difficult because you don't believe get
a<00:01:07.170> chance<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.729> things<00:01:09.240> could<00:01:09.510> go

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a chance to to see if things could go

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
a chance to to see if things could go
out<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> plan<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.299> there's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
out to the way you plan you know there's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
out to the way you plan you know there's
an<00:01:12.689> immediate<00:01:13.020> shock<00:01:13.369> after<00:01:14.369> after<00:01:15.360> 15

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
an immediate shock after after 15

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.770 
an immediate shock after after 15
seconds<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> things<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
seconds and you know all the things you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
seconds and you know all the things you
prepared<00:01:19.080> during<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> week<00:01:20.360> become

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
prepared during the week become

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.010 
prepared during the week become
secondary

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
secondary

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.480 
secondary
because<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.939> know<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.210> suffered<00:01:26.369> into<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
because you know we suffered into the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.889 
because you know we suffered into the
game<00:01:27.640> immediately<00:01:27.880> 15<00:01:28.329> seconds<00:01:28.630> into<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
game immediately 15 seconds into the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.090 
game immediately 15 seconds into the
game<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.229> then<00:01:30.030> concentration<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.119> not<00:01:31.270> there

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
game and then concentration is not there

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.990 
game and then concentration is not there
anyway<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.159> think<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.460> reaction<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.909> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
anyway I think the reaction of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.760 
anyway I think the reaction of the
players<00:01:34.240> was<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.990> was<00:01:35.200> positive<00:01:35.409> after

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
players was it was positive after

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.929 
players was it was positive after
suffering<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.250> roll<00:01:36.399> like<00:01:36.549> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.630 

everything<00:01:39.939> went<00:01:40.270> wrong<00:01:41.080> for<00:01:41.380> us<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:42.580> know

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
everything went wrong for us you know

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.410 
everything went wrong for us you know
every<00:01:43.030> single<00:01:43.600> opportunity<00:01:44.500> was<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> goal

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
every single opportunity was was a goal

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.380 
every single opportunity was was a goal
and<00:01:46.720> we<00:01:47.679> paid<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> heavy<00:01:48.130> price<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.610> think<00:01:48.640> too

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
and we paid a heavy price I think too

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.490 
and we paid a heavy price I think too
much<00:01:49.570> for<00:01:49.810> what<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.899> under<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.380> is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
much for what we put it under it is

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.169 
much for what we put it under it is
basically<00:01:53.799> because<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.369> first<00:01:54.670> call<00:01:54.909> it

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
basically because of that first call it

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.010 
basically because of that first call it
changed<00:01:55.600> everything<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:57.429> know<00:01:57.549> Neal<00:01:58.360> 3:11

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
changed everything you know Neal 3:11

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.480 
changed everything you know Neal 3:11
you<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.259> chance<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.649> come<00:02:00.039> back<00:02:00.190> into<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
you have a chance to come back into the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.520 
you have a chance to come back into the
game<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.909> only<00:02:00.940> thing<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.539> couldn't

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
game the only thing is that we couldn't

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.139 
game the only thing is that we couldn't
finish<00:02:02.679> off<00:02:02.920> any<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.429> situations<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
finish off any of the situations that we
