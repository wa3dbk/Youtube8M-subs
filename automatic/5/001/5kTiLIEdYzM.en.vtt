00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.899
 grain 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.899
 cumin grain because this broth is going 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.920
 to strain is going to separate the pieces of 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:58.149
 chicken is going to discard the vegetable and goes to 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.149
