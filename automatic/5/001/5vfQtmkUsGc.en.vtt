00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
take these rings and you have to split

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.180 
take these rings and you have to split
these<00:04:05.340> rings<00:04:06.350> split<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> ring<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.799> pull<00:04:08.010> these

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
these rings split the ring to pull these

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.710 
these rings split the ring to pull these
rings<00:04:08.459> off<00:04:08.760> because<00:04:09.000> they'll<00:04:09.329> getting<00:04:09.570> away

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
rings off because they'll getting away

rings off because they'll getting away
the<00:04:09.900> kit<00:04:10.140> but<00:04:10.829> at<00:04:11.130> least<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:13.170> won't<00:04:13.260> have<00:04:13.410> to

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
cut your wires 24 wires there don't want

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.120 
cut your wires 24 wires there don't want
to<00:04:15.780> splice<00:04:16.020> all<00:04:16.289> them<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.620> save<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.950> lot<00:04:17.070> of

to splice all them and save you a lot of

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.680 
to splice all them and save you a lot of
time<00:04:17.340> now<00:04:17.549> if<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:18.209> can't

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
time now if you can't

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380 
time now if you can't
they're<00:04:19.470> neat<00:04:20.100> about<00:04:20.220> eight<00:04:20.549> eight<00:04:20.940> inches

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
they're neat about eight eight inches

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.050 
they're neat about eight eight inches

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
out there's not 18 inches here now when

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.940 
out there's not 18 inches here now when
you<00:04:24.240> pull<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.570> out<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> little<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:24.960> further<00:04:25.170> if

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
you pull it out a little bit further if

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you can't if you have to slice the wire

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.330 
you can't if you have to slice the wire
splice<00:04:27.600> them<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.170> middle<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.650> then

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
splice them right in the middle and then

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.730 
splice them right in the middle and then
you<00:04:30.090> don't<00:04:30.240> have<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.480> cut<00:04:30.660> all<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:30.930> boot<00:04:31.200> in

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
you don't have to cut all this boot in

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.710 
you don't have to cut all this boot in
this<00:04:32.100> just<00:04:32.460> pull<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.850> all<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:32.970> way<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.420> splice

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
this just pull it all the way but splice

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.790 
this just pull it all the way but splice
your<00:04:33.870> wires<00:04:34.050> right<00:04:34.320> in<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.470> middle<00:04:34.650> it's

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
your wires right in the middle it's

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.050 
your wires right in the middle it's
leaving<00:04:35.040> enough<00:04:35.190> hanging<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.490> both<00:04:35.640> sides<00:04:35.910> so

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
leaving enough hanging on both sides so

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.780 
leaving enough hanging on both sides so
you<00:04:36.170> easily<00:04:37.170> wire<00:04:37.380> man<00:04:37.740> all<00:04:38.370> right

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you easily wire man all right

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.510 
you easily wire man all right
and<00:04:39.060> what<00:04:39.330> we're<00:04:39.480> gonna<00:04:39.630> do<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.250> since<00:04:41.250> we<00:04:41.370> got

and what we're gonna do now since we got
the<00:04:42.710> hinges<00:04:43.710> off<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:45.030> hinges<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:51.830> we're<00:04:52.830> gonna

here has to be rounded down a little bit

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.890 
here has to be rounded down a little bit
because<00:04:58.800> Cheveley<00:04:59.790> crimped<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.390> on<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.690> end
