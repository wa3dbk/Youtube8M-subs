vocals the combination just felt really

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.819 
vocals the combination just felt really
natural<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> record<00:00:51.570> however<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
natural on this record however the the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.760 
natural on this record however the the
downside<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.789> LP<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
downside of this LP was is that this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
downside of this LP was is that this
marriage<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.699> two<00:00:57.000> different<00:00:57.449> extreme<00:00:57.930> metal

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
marriage of two different extreme metal

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.310 
marriage of two different extreme metal
styles<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> most<00:01:00.030> original<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
styles was really the most original and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
styles was really the most original and
significant<00:01:02.309> thing<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.730> record<00:01:03.030> had

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
significant thing that this record had

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080 
significant thing that this record had
to<00:01:03.449> offer<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> vocals<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.820> riff

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to offer because the vocals and the riff

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
to offer because the vocals and the riff
writing<00:01:06.600> were<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> write

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
writing were not really much to write

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
writing were not really much to write

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.840 
last LP Lord mantis is still black and
slugs<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.380> feel<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:43.950> add<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.549> much

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
slugs but I feel like they add so much

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.020 
slugs but I feel like they add so much
more<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> mixture<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.049> well<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.310> nose

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
more to the mixture as well for one nose

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.539 
more to the mixture as well for one nose
weaving<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> into<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.320> walls<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.950> very<00:01:50.130> heavy

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
weaving it into these walls a very heavy

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.200 
weaving it into these walls a very heavy
bass<00:01:51.479> e<00:01:51.710> ringing<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.890> riffs<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:53.880> seem<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
bass e ringing out riffs which seem a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
bass e ringing out riffs which seem a
bit<00:01:54.390> slower<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> spaced<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.680> time

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
bit slower and spaced out this time

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
bit slower and spaced out this time
around<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> doom<00:01:56.880> influence

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
around like a bit of doom influence

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230 
around like a bit of doom influence
working<00:01:58.140> its<00:01:58.290> way<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.280> fold<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> then

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
working its way into the fold and then

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
working its way into the fold and then
there's<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> vocals<00:02:01.290> too<00:02:01.439> which<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:01.710> are

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
record there are moments where I'm

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.490 
record there are moments where I'm
incredibly<00:06:14.180> impressed<00:06:14.450> to<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.050> point<00:06:15.320> where

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
incredibly impressed to the point where

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.210 
incredibly impressed to the point where
I<00:06:15.530> feel<00:06:15.979> like<00:06:16.039> Lord<00:06:16.520> mantis<00:06:17.030> bests<00:06:17.950> Indian<00:06:18.950> and

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
I feel like Lord mantis bests Indian and

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.980 
I feel like Lord mantis bests Indian and
not<00:06:19.580> even<00:06:19.820> on<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.180> track<00:06:20.450> where<00:06:20.630> Indians

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
not even on the track where Indians

vocalist<00:06:21.500> is<00:06:21.650> featured<00:06:22.039> on<00:06:22.160> here<00:06:22.370> that's

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
vocalist is featured on here that's

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.279 
vocalist is featured on here that's
actually<00:06:22.880> one<00:06:23.000> of<00:06:23.030> my<00:06:23.090> least<00:06:23.360> favorites<00:06:23.810> but<00:06:24.080> I

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
actually one of my least favorites but I

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.089 
actually one of my least favorites but I
also<00:06:24.470> have<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:24.800> say<00:06:25.010> this<00:06:25.160> record<00:06:25.580> is<00:06:25.760> terribly

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
also have to say this record is terribly

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.750 
also have to say this record is terribly
front-loaded<00:06:28.130> I<00:06:28.220> don't<00:06:28.400> think<00:06:28.520> there's<00:06:28.669> a

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
front-loaded I don't think there's a

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.460 
front-loaded I don't think there's a
single<00:06:29.000> song<00:06:29.419> in<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.720> second<00:06:30.110> half<00:06:30.289> of<00:06:30.349> this

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
single song in the second half of this

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.440 
single song in the second half of this
record<00:06:30.710> that<00:06:30.830> is<00:06:31.039> nearly<00:06:31.550> as<00:06:31.669> interesting<00:06:32.270> as

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
record that is nearly as interesting as

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.000 
record that is nearly as interesting as
any<00:06:32.690> of<00:06:32.870> the<00:06:32.930> material<00:06:33.380> in<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.560> first<00:06:33.770> half

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
any of the material in the first half

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.610 
any of the material in the first half
sure<00:06:34.580> it's<00:06:34.820> not<00:06:34.969> all<00:06:35.120> terrible<00:06:35.630> but<00:06:35.840> it<00:06:36.200> just

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
sure it's not all terrible but it just

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.110 
sure it's not all terrible but it just
doesn't<00:06:36.830> hold<00:06:37.039> my<00:06:37.219> interest<00:06:37.640> as<00:06:37.789> much<00:06:37.969> at

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
doesn't hold my interest as much at

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.980 
doesn't hold my interest as much at
least<00:06:38.270> up<00:06:38.510> until<00:06:38.599> the<00:06:38.900> very<00:06:39.200> final

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
least up until the very final

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.570 
least up until the very final
moments<00:06:40.290> of<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.470> closing<00:06:40.740> track<00:06:41.040> on<00:06:41.340> here

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
moments of the closing track on here

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.450 
moments of the closing track on here
where<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.270> riffs<00:06:42.600> and<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.410> walls<00:06:43.800> of<00:06:44.220> noise

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.240
