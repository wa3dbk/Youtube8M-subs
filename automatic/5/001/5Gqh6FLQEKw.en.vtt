okay<00:00:02.720> we're<00:00:02.930> into<00:00:03.170> lesson<00:00:03.830> for<00:00:04.160> our<00:00:04.370> beginners

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
okay we're into lesson for our beginners

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.999 
okay we're into lesson for our beginners
modules<00:00:05.870> for<00:00:06.230> this<00:00:06.379> lesson<00:00:06.620> we're<00:00:06.859> going<00:00:06.890> to

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
modules for this lesson we're going to

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.490 
modules for this lesson we're going to
be<00:00:07.129> taking<00:00:07.520> a<00:00:07.580> look<00:00:07.609> at<00:00:08.060> some<00:00:08.750> basic<00:00:08.960> bar

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
be taking a look at some basic bar

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400 
be taking a look at some basic bar
chords<00:00:09.980> now<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:10.910> idea<00:00:11.059> of<00:00:11.540> a<00:00:11.599> bar<00:00:11.870> chord<00:00:12.170> is

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
chords now the idea of a bar chord is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.720 
chords now the idea of a bar chord is
that<00:00:12.830> we<00:00:13.429> can<00:00:13.730> move<00:00:14.570> our<00:00:14.870> basic<00:00:15.589> open<00:00:16.309> position

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
that we can move our basic open position

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.960 
that we can move our basic open position
shapes<00:00:17.060> around<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.080> neck<00:00:18.340> changing<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.580> name

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
shapes around the neck changing the name

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.300 
shapes around the neck changing the name
of<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.270> chord<00:00:20.570> but<00:00:21.410> without<00:00:21.740> changing<00:00:22.189> the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
of the chord but without changing the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.009 
of the chord but without changing the
fingering<00:00:22.670> of<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.850> core<00:00:23.060> we<00:00:23.269> just<00:00:23.449> simply

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
fingering of the core we just simply

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.400 
fingering of the core we just simply
move<00:00:24.740> up<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.099> down<00:00:25.359> before<00:00:26.359> we<00:00:26.390> do<00:00:26.689> this<00:00:26.930> we

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
move up and down before we do this we

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.460 
move up and down before we do this we
need<00:00:27.439> to<00:00:27.740> be<00:00:27.949> able<00:00:28.429> to<00:00:28.880> hold<00:00:29.269> a<00:00:29.599> bar<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.170> in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
need to be able to hold a bar and in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.130 
need to be able to hold a bar and in
previous<00:00:30.949> lessons<00:00:31.670> we've<00:00:32.180> looked<00:00:32.420> at<00:00:32.689> holding

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
previous lessons we've looked at holding

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.560 
previous lessons we've looked at holding
partial<00:00:33.650> bars<00:00:33.890> borrowing<00:00:34.700> across<00:00:35.000> three

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
partial bars borrowing across three

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.260 
partial bars borrowing across three
strings<00:00:36.370> two<00:00:37.370> strings<00:00:38.380> for<00:00:39.380> this<00:00:40.000> approach<00:00:41.000> we

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
strings two strings for this approach we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.710 
strings two strings for this approach we
need<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:41.600> hold<00:00:41.870> either<00:00:42.670> five<00:00:43.670> or<00:00:44.000> six<00:00:44.450> strings

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
need to hold either five or six strings

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.640 
need to hold either five or six strings
let's<00:00:45.290> take<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> look<00:00:45.770> at<00:00:45.980> our<00:00:46.250> six<00:00:47.120> string<00:00:47.390> bar

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
let's take a look at our six string bar

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.400 
let's take a look at our six string bar
to<00:00:48.650> start<00:00:48.890> off<00:00:49.010> with<00:00:49.250> I'd<00:00:49.820> keep<00:00:50.420> my<00:00:50.660> thumb<00:00:51.200> and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
to start off with I'd keep my thumb and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.460 
to start off with I'd keep my thumb and
second<00:00:52.040> finger<00:00:52.310> in<00:00:52.430> line<00:00:52.640> with<00:00:52.820> each<00:00:52.940> other

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
second finger in line with each other

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.900 
second finger in line with each other
hold<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.590> thumb<00:00:54.830> on<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.280> back<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.490> the<00:00:55.700> neck

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
hold the thumb on the back of the neck

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.870 
hold the thumb on the back of the neck
and<00:00:56.210> then<00:00:56.720> add<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.140> bar<00:00:57.410> laying<00:00:58.130> it<00:00:58.340> slightly

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
and then add the bar laying it slightly

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.240 
and then add the bar laying it slightly
on<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.210> outer<00:00:59.450> edge<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.900> the<00:00:59.960> finger<00:01:00.410> now<00:01:01.040> make

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
on the outer edge of the finger now make

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.400 
on the outer edge of the finger now make
sure<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.730> apply<00:01:01.850> even<00:01:02.750> pressure<00:01:02.780> don't

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
sure that you apply even pressure don't

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.860 
sure that you apply even pressure don't
grip<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.189> push<00:01:04.699> down<00:01:04.729> too<00:01:05.239> hard<00:01:05.269> all<00:01:05.750> that

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
grip and push down too hard all that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.270 
grip and push down too hard all that
will<00:01:06.020> do<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.200> adjust<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.770> pitch<00:01:06.980> of<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
will do is adjust the pitch of the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.460 
will do is adjust the pitch of the
strings<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:08.270> lightly<00:01:08.630> lay<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.050> finger

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
strings just lightly lay the finger

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.180 
strings just lightly lay the finger
across

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.270 

and<00:01:13.460> then<00:01:14.030> pick<00:01:14.420> each<00:01:14.570> individual<00:01:15.500> string<00:01:16.070> to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
and then pick each individual string to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.830 
and then pick each individual string to
make<00:01:16.460> sure<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> notes<00:01:17.180> are<00:01:17.540> ringing

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
make sure that the notes are ringing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.430 
make sure that the notes are ringing
nice<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.260> clearly

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.370 

okay<00:01:25.440> before<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.979> move<00:01:26.670> our<00:01:26.880> cords<00:01:27.270> around<00:01:27.390> we

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
okay before we move our cords around we

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
okay before we move our cords around we
have<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.830> aware<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.570> one<00:01:30.570> note<00:01:30.840> in

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
have to be aware of one note in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
have to be aware of one note in
particular<00:01:31.350> which<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> root<00:01:32.280> note<00:01:32.520> now

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
particular which is the root note now

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
particular which is the root note now
the<00:01:33.450> root<00:01:33.690> note<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.110> name<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.009> note<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the root note is the name the note that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.180 
the root note is the name the note that
gives<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> cord<00:01:36.090> its<00:01:36.930> name<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.040> I'm

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
gives the cord its name so if I'm

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.920 
gives the cord its name so if I'm
playing<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.580> E<00:01:38.880> chord<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.420> major<00:01:41.540> root<00:01:42.540> note<00:01:42.750> of

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
a bar chords to do this we have to

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.930 
a bar chords to do this we have to
change<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.800> way<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.220> we<00:02:02.340> hold<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.729> chord

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
change the way that we hold the chord

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.820 
change the way that we hold the chord
change<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> fingers<00:02:03.780> instead<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.440> using<00:02:04.590> our

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
change the fingers instead of using our

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.859 
change the fingers instead of using our
first<00:02:05.130> second<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.580> third<00:02:05.880> fingers<00:02:06.179> we're

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
first second and third fingers we're

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.889 
first second and third fingers we're
going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.050> use<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.380> second<00:02:08.070> third<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> fourth

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
going to use our second third and fourth

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.500 
going to use our second third and fourth
fingers<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:11.100> gives<00:02:11.340> us<00:02:11.489> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.539 

now<00:02:16.510> what<00:02:16.689> I'm<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.439> shift<00:02:18.189> the

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
now what I'm going to do is shift the

in doing that I'm not moving the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.849 
in doing that I'm not moving the
distance<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.599> these<00:02:25.840> notes<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.499> I'm<00:02:26.620> holding

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
going to move these notes up i need to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.559 
going to move these notes up i need to
compensate<00:02:35.889> and<00:02:36.280> move<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.700> open<00:02:37.030> strings<00:02:37.389> up

then<00:05:25.999> e<00:05:27.129> so<00:05:28.129> from<00:05:28.309> our<00:05:28.429> one<00:05:29.289> chord<00:05:30.289> shape<00:05:30.649> we

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
then e so from our one chord shape we

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.719 
then e so from our one chord shape we
can<00:05:31.189> play<00:05:31.429> a<00:05:31.669> total<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.569> twelve<00:05:33.139> chords<00:05:33.800> so

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
can play a total of twelve chords so

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.580 
can play a total of twelve chords so
whereas<00:05:35.389> before<00:05:35.569> we<00:05:36.169> could<00:05:36.379> place<00:05:36.559> a<00:05:36.830> ad

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:49.650 

using<00:05:42.280> open<00:05:42.580> position<00:05:43.000> we<00:05:43.750> can<00:05:43.780> now<00:05:44.080> play<00:05:44.410> a

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.890 

the<00:05:50.440> progression<00:05:51.010> all<00:05:51.370> sounds<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.210> same<00:05:52.360> in

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
the progression all sounds the same in

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.480 
the progression all sounds the same in
the<00:05:52.960> sense<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.440> you're<00:05:53.650> playing<00:05:53.920> you<00:05:54.400> know

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
the sense that you're playing you know

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.310 
the sense that you're playing you know
the<00:05:54.610> same<00:05:54.820> chords<00:05:55.300> but<00:05:55.690> because<00:05:55.990> we're<00:05:56.140> using

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
the same chords but because we're using

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.040 
the same chords but because we're using
a<00:05:56.500> new<00:05:56.740> shape<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.850> order<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.420> the<00:05:58.780> notes

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
a new shape the order of the notes

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.170 
a new shape the order of the notes
within<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.590> shape<00:05:59.860> are<00:06:00.100> different<00:06:00.640> they're

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
within this shape are different they're

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.640 
within this shape are different they're
stacked<00:06:01.600> differently<00:06:02.050> they're<00:06:02.230> stacked<00:06:02.500> in

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
stacked differently they're stacked in

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.720 
stacked differently they're stacked in
the<00:06:02.680> way<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:03.040> they<00:06:03.100> would<00:06:03.340> be<00:06:03.370> if<00:06:03.580> you<00:06:03.610> were

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
the way that they would be if you were

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.790 
the way that they would be if you were
holding<00:06:03.910> an<00:06:04.150> E<00:06:04.480> chord<00:06:04.530> whereas<00:06:05.530> you<00:06:05.590> buy<00:06:05.770> a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
holding an E chord whereas you buy a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.130 
holding an E chord whereas you buy a
regular<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.310> chord<00:06:06.790> it<00:06:06.940> has<00:06:07.530> two<00:06:08.530> roots<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:11.110> a

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
regular a chord it has two roots to a

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.430 
regular a chord it has two roots to a
note<00:06:11.500> stewie<00:06:11.800> notes<00:06:12.160> and<00:06:12.790> one<00:06:13.000> C<00:06:13.270> sharp<00:06:13.600> if<00:06:13.870> I

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
note stewie notes and one C sharp if I

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.950 
note stewie notes and one C sharp if I
hold<00:06:14.710> an<00:06:15.010> ache<00:06:15.490> orbit<00:06:15.910> using<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.300> E<00:06:16.510> chord

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
hold an ache orbit using the E chord

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.040 
hold an ache orbit using the E chord
shape<00:06:17.710> it<00:06:18.340> will<00:06:18.490> have<00:06:18.700> 3<00:06:19.120> a's<00:06:19.300> two<00:06:22.920> E's<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:25.630> one

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
shape it will have 3 a's two E's and one

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.440 
shape it will have 3 a's two E's and one
C<00:06:26.320> sharp<00:06:26.650> so<00:06:26.890> it<00:06:26.980> has<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.280> voicing<00:06:27.880> or<00:06:28.180> the

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
C sharp so it has the voicing or the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.570 
C sharp so it has the voicing or the
order<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.020> notes<00:06:29.290> found<00:06:30.070> within<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:31.120> e<00:06:31.150> shape
