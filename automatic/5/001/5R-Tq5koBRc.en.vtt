00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.570 

so<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.930> Lexia<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> specific<00:00:02.280> learning

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so this Lexia is a specific learning

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.090 
so this Lexia is a specific learning
difficulty<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.570> not<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> disease<00:00:04.230> so

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
difficulty it's not a disease so

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.990 
difficulty it's not a disease so
students<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.270> not<00:00:06.299> disabled<00:00:07.170> but<00:00:07.919> they<00:00:08.670> have

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
students are not disabled but they have

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.690 
students are not disabled but they have
a<00:00:09.240> different<00:00:09.870> way<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> thinking<00:00:10.340> as<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> matter

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
a different way of thinking as a matter

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
a different way of thinking as a matter
of<00:00:11.790> fact<00:00:13.099> dyslexic<00:00:14.099> students<00:00:14.900> rely<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.320> on

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
of fact dyslexic students rely more on

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.400 
of fact dyslexic students rely more on
the<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.279> hemisphere<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.720> means<00:00:19.020> that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the right hemisphere which means that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
the right hemisphere which means that
for<00:00:19.980> instance<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.580> visual<00:00:20.939> students

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
for instance they are visual students

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.519 
for instance they are visual students
they<00:00:22.170> rely<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.369> visual<00:00:23.850> code<00:00:24.810> for

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
they rely on the visual code for

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
they rely on the visual code for
instance<00:00:26.010> pictures<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:27.000> very<00:00:27.300> useful<00:00:27.840> for

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
instance pictures are very useful for

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.160 
instance pictures are very useful for
them<00:00:28.250> they<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> specific<00:00:29.900> difficulty<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
them they have a specific difficulty in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.979 
them they have a specific difficulty in
crack<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> written<00:00:32.489> code<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.690> means

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
crack in the written code which means

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.889 
crack in the written code which means
that<00:00:34.520> reading<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:36.149> challenging<00:00:36.450> task

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that reading is a very challenging task

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
that reading is a very challenging task
but<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.640> comprehension

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but they do not have comprehension

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080 
but they do not have comprehension
problems<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> matter<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> fact<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.790> we

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
problems as a matter of fact if we

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.889 
problems as a matter of fact if we
pronounce<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> sentence<00:00:44.700> instead<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.360> just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pronounce the sentence instead of just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.100 
pronounce the sentence instead of just
writing<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:48.000> course<00:00:48.390> students<00:00:49.020> can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
writing it of course students can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
writing it of course students can
understand<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> meaning<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
understand the meaning so what are the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
understand the meaning so what are the
three<00:00:51.930> most<00:00:52.289> important<00:00:52.860> things<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
three most important things that a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.860 
three most important things that a
teacher<00:00:54.149> needs<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.699> well<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.120> instance<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
teacher needs to do well for instance a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
teacher needs to do well for instance a
teacher<00:00:58.649> an<00:00:59.039> English<00:00:59.460> language<00:00:59.820> teacher

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
teacher an English language teacher

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.009 
teacher an English language teacher
should<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:01.260> aware<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.789> multiple<00:01:03.690> codes

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
should be aware of the multiple codes

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.719 
should be aware of the multiple codes
that<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.979> use<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:06.290> enhance<00:01:07.729> comprehension

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that we can use to enhance comprehension

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
that we can use to enhance comprehension
for<00:01:09.420> instance<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.409> rely<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
for instance do not rely just on the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.440 
for instance do not rely just on the
written<00:01:12.150> code<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
written code but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.920

second<00:01:26.630> thing<00:01:27.369> activities<00:01:28.369> should<00:01:28.759> be

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
second thing activities should be

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.270 
second thing activities should be
structured<00:01:29.329> because<00:01:29.869> students<00:01:30.860> because<00:01:31.250> of

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
implies automatic skills when you read

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.999 
implies automatic skills when you read
you<00:01:38.869> automatized

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
you automatized

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.399 
you automatized
everything<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.240> automatize<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.110> written

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
everything you to automatize the written

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.100 
everything you to automatize the written
code<00:01:42.700> for<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:43.880> reason<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.509> activities

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
code for this reason the activities

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.240 
code for this reason the activities
should<00:01:45.619> be<00:01:46.599> structured<00:01:47.599> which<00:01:48.319> means<00:01:48.619> for

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
should be structured which means for

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.550 
should be structured which means for
instance<00:01:49.399> two<00:01:49.970> more<00:01:50.119> forms<00:01:50.560> multiple-choice

or<00:01:52.390> picture<00:01:53.390> word<00:01:53.689> matching<00:01:54.679> are<00:01:54.920> better

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
or picture word matching are better

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.740 
or picture word matching are better
third<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.530> activities<00:01:58.159> should<00:01:58.819> be<00:01:58.880> mono

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
third the activities should be mono
