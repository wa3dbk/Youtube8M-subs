00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
suppose it's a bit of a mythical thing

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.259 
suppose it's a bit of a mythical thing
where<00:03:56.220> people<00:03:56.250> were<00:03:56.669> concerned<00:03:56.909> about

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
where people were concerned about

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.939 
where people were concerned about
something<00:03:57.780> being<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.229> game<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:58.620> didn't

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
something being in the game and didn't

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.800 
something being in the game and didn't
really<00:03:59.190> want<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.489> there<00:03:59.729> and<00:03:59.940> now<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.720> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
really want it there and now that it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.449 
really want it there and now that it
isn't<00:04:01.139> there<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.620> think<00:04:01.949> people<00:04:02.190> are<00:04:02.280> kind<00:04:02.430> of

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
isn't there I think people are kind of

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.649 
isn't there I think people are kind of
looking<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.760> saying<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:03.000> wish<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.269> was<00:04:03.419> there

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
looking and saying I wish it was there

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.000 
looking and saying I wish it was there
because<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.049> don't<00:04:04.199> think<00:04:04.409> it<00:04:04.530> really<00:04:04.560> made

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
because I don't think it really made

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.979 
because I don't think it really made
that<00:04:05.159> much<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.579> difference<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.209> is

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
that much of a difference and that is

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.860 
that much of a difference and that is

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
been actually incorporated into the game

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.580 
been actually incorporated into the game
now<00:04:18.000> those<00:04:18.359> games<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.930> their<00:04:19.049> own<00:04:19.139> rights<00:04:19.409> were

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
now those games in their own rights were

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.620 
now those games in their own rights were
great<00:04:19.889> but<00:04:20.159> also<00:04:20.310> terrible<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.329> know<00:04:21.449> they

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
great but also terrible you know they

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.300 
great but also terrible you know they
had<00:04:21.659> good<00:04:22.049> points<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.590> very<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:22.950> bad

negative points now what people

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.120 
negative points now what people
generally<00:04:25.289> tended<00:04:26.219> to<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.550> was<00:04:26.789> to

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
generally tended to do was to

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.070 
generally tended to do was to
most<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.790> connection<00:04:28.570> issues<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
most of the connection issues and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.840 
most of the connection issues and
everything<00:04:29.380> else<00:04:29.590> I'm<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.430> fact<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.730> the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
everything else I'm the fact that the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.270 
everything else I'm the fact that the
theater<00:04:31.060> mode<00:04:31.270> was<00:04:31.510> causing<00:04:31.960> those<00:04:32.080> problems

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
theater mode was causing those problems

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.680 
theater mode was causing those problems
now<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.310> think<00:04:33.460> if<00:04:33.730> we<00:04:33.850> look<00:04:34.000> at<00:04:34.090> call<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.300> duty

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
now I think if we look at call of duty

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.600 
now I think if we look at call of duty

there I think people kind of a griever

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.560 
there I think people kind of a griever
they're<00:04:39.190> still<00:04:39.460> connection<00:04:39.910> problems<00:04:40.360> there

like him could benefit from something
like<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.210> but<00:06:07.360> other<00:06:07.510> people<00:06:07.870> as<00:06:07.960> well<00:06:07.990> you

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
like that but other people as well you

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.260 
like that but other people as well you

know I used ease theater mode every now
and<00:06:10.360> then<00:06:10.480> and<00:06:10.600> I<00:06:10.690> think<00:06:10.960> for<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.170> noob<00:06:11.440> of<00:06:11.590> the

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
and then and I think for the noob of the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.260 
and then and I think for the noob of the
week<00:06:11.890> series<00:06:12.310> when<00:06:12.520> it<00:06:12.610> comes<00:06:12.820> to<00:06:12.970> call<00:06:13.150> of

week series when it comes to call of
duty<00:06:13.510> ghosts<00:06:13.720> it's<00:06:14.410> kind<00:06:14.530> of<00:06:14.650> hard<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:14.890> grasp

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
duty ghosts it's kind of hard to grasp

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.790 
duty ghosts it's kind of hard to grasp
the<00:06:15.490> initial<00:06:15.910> I<00:06:16.030> suppose<00:06:16.390> lead-up<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.350> the

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
the initial I suppose lead-up to the

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.560 
the initial I suppose lead-up to the
particular<00:06:18.160> new<00:06:18.550> business<00:06:18.970> that<00:06:19.180> I'm<00:06:19.300> trying

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
particular new business that I'm trying

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.050 
particular new business that I'm trying
to<00:06:19.750> forecast<00:06:20.230> and<00:06:20.620> broadcast<00:06:21.160> to<00:06:21.340> you<00:06:21.370> when

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
to forecast and broadcast to you when

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.220 
to forecast and broadcast to you when
you<00:06:22.180> haven't<00:06:22.360> got<00:06:22.480> that<00:06:22.600> theater<00:06:23.110> mode

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
you haven't got that theater mode

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.330 
you haven't got that theater mode
because<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.710> can't<00:06:23.920> really<00:06:23.950> see<00:06:24.130> it

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
because you can't really see it

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.280 
because you can't really see it
happening<00:06:24.760> in<00:06:25.000> kind<00:06:25.390> of<00:06:25.480> like<00:06:25.630> not<00:06:25.780> real<00:06:26.050> time

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
happening in kind of like not real time

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.830 
happening in kind of like not real time
but<00:06:26.470> in<00:06:26.560> past<00:06:26.800> time<00:06:27.040> and<00:06:27.450> let's<00:06:28.450> just<00:06:28.510> face<00:06:28.780> it

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
but in past time and let's just face it

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.890 
but in past time and let's just face it
was<00:06:29.110> fun<00:06:29.500> even<00:06:30.220> if<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.760> game<00:06:30.970> sucked<00:06:31.360> it<00:06:31.540> was<00:06:31.660> fun

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
was fun even if a game sucked it was fun

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.480 
was fun even if a game sucked it was fun
having<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.380> theater<00:06:32.770> mode<00:06:32.860> because<00:06:33.100> people

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
having that theater mode because people

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.100 
having that theater mode because people
would<00:06:33.580> just<00:06:33.730> try<00:06:33.940> and<00:06:34.000> get<00:06:34.120> bank<00:06:34.450> shots<00:06:34.810> and

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
would just try and get bank shots and

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.530 
would just try and get bank shots and
use<00:06:35.350> the<00:06:35.919> theater<00:06:36.310> mode<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.669> our<00:06:36.850> to<00:06:37.150> capture

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
use the theater mode to our to capture

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.420 
use the theater mode to our to capture
that<00:06:37.690> so<00:06:38.140> yeah<00:06:38.320> I<00:06:38.530> think<00:06:38.710> they<00:06:39.040> need<00:06:39.160> to<00:06:39.190> bring

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
that so yeah I think they need to bring

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.890 
that so yeah I think they need to bring
theater<00:06:39.760> my<00:06:39.850> back<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.270> think<00:06:40.479> it's<00:06:40.630> something

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
theater my back I think it's something

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.300 
theater my back I think it's something
that's<00:06:41.139> desperately<00:06:41.620> missing<00:06:41.860> from<00:06:42.100> call<00:06:42.280> of

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
that's desperately missing from call of

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.860 
that's desperately missing from call of
duty<00:06:42.639> ghosts<00:06:42.880> and<00:06:43.120> I<00:06:43.330> think<00:06:43.540> it's<00:06:43.660> something

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
duty ghosts and I think it's something

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.300 
duty ghosts and I think it's something
that<00:06:44.169> should<00:06:44.380> have<00:06:44.470> been<00:06:44.500> added<00:06:44.740> in<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.009> first

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
that should have been added in the first

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.520 
that should have been added in the first
place<00:06:45.460> or<00:06:45.820> certainly<00:06:46.240> bought<00:06:46.870> back<00:06:47.110> in<00:06:47.320> some

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
place or certainly bought back in some

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.050 
place or certainly bought back in some
respects<00:06:47.919> to<00:06:48.100> try<00:06:48.280> and<00:06:48.400> give<00:06:48.490> it<00:06:48.520> some<00:06:48.790> bite

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
respects to try and give it some bite

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.090 
respects to try and give it some bite
again<00:06:49.240> because<00:06:50.169> it's<00:06:50.380> lost<00:06:50.620> a<00:06:50.740> lot<00:06:50.889> of<00:06:50.919> its
