and<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.049> story<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> went<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> Duke

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and my story know that I went to Duke

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.490 
and my story know that I went to Duke
and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> studied<00:01:42.240> game<00:01:42.420> theory<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.350> then

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and I studied game theory there and then

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.630 
and I studied game theory there and then
I<00:01:43.530> kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.220> angle<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
I kind of have a different angle on the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
I kind of have a different angle on the
whole<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> whole<00:01:45.299> poker<00:01:45.720> thing<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.290> at

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
whole on the whole poker thing look at

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.719 
whole on the whole poker thing look at
things<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.649> differently<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> my

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
things a little differently some of my

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.770 
things a little differently some of my
ideas<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.299> controversial

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
ideas are a little more controversial

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.170 
ideas are a little more controversial
but<00:01:49.680> i<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.950> i<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.520> i<00:01:50.759> have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
but i think i think that i have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.399 
but i think i think that i have
something<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> add<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
something to add to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.200 
something to add to
the<00:01:52.979> discourse<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.399> goes<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:53.909> poker

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the discourse that goes on about poker

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
the discourse that goes on about poker
theory<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> spend<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> time<00:01:55.710> designing

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
theory so spend a lot of time designing

this curriculum to take place July 4th
at<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.890> MGM<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.999> actually<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
at the MGM and it's actually going to be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950 
at the MGM and it's actually going to be
taught<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> game<00:02:01.859> unto<00:02:02.399> itself<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
taught as a game unto itself so it's a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
taught as a game unto itself so it's a
really<00:02:04.259> interactive<00:02:04.950> simulation<00:02:05.670> learn<00:02:05.880> by

makes those fantastic reads i'm actually
going<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> use<00:02:56.370> some<00:02:56.639> of<00:02:56.670> his<00:02:56.940> excellent<00:02:57.870> reads

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
going to use some of his excellent reads

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.559 
going to use some of his excellent reads
to<00:02:58.200> show<00:02:58.440> how<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.920> game<00:02:59.280> theorists<00:02:59.700> would<00:03:00.329> I

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
to show how a game theorists would I

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.759 
to show how a game theorists would I
mean<00:03:00.720> whether<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:00.959> not<00:03:01.019> Daniel<00:03:01.319> knows<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.650> he

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
mean whether or not Daniel knows that he

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.080 
mean whether or not Daniel knows that he
is<00:03:01.799> using<00:03:02.040> game<00:03:02.310> theory<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.639> make<00:03:02.760> those<00:03:02.910> rates

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
is using game theory to make those rates

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.629 
is using game theory to make those rates
he's<00:03:03.209> not<00:03:03.359> actually<00:03:03.569> clairvoyant<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:04.889> then

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
he's not actually clairvoyant but then

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.270 
he's not actually clairvoyant but then
so<00:03:05.910> things<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> also<00:03:07.290> some<00:03:07.859> cool<00:03:08.069> game

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
so things like that also some cool game

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.170 
so things like that also some cool game
