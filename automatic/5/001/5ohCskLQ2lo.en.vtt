older that has been on the ball and make

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.730 
older that has been on the ball and make
it<00:00:17.760> possible<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.630> again<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.320> stick

it possible for the again like to stick

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.660 
it possible for the again like to stick
to<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:21.090> candy<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:21.779> before<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.670> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
to the candy that was before and the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.269 
to the candy that was before and the
second<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.840> humidity<00:00:25.260> too<00:00:25.740> much

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
second you had some humidity too much

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.439 
second you had some humidity too much
and<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:29.029> much<00:00:30.029> easier<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and they that make it much easier to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.380 
and they that make it much easier to
work<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
work with

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.860

because it but in this case I'm going to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.979 
because it but in this case I'm going to
do<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> stone<00:00:43.800> ball<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:45.780> cannot

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
do it on the stone ball and you cannot

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
do it on the stone ball and you cannot
see<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.770> case<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:50.100> away<00:00:50.460> all

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.099 
see but in this case and most away all
dust<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> still<00:00:54.210> humid<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> also

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
dust and and it is still humid but also

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
dust and and it is still humid but also
but<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:59.210> important<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> eat<00:01:00.930> all

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
but it is important here to eat all

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.140 
but it is important here to eat all
water<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.160> run<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:03.830> before<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.280> also<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
water to run off before you also you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840 
water to run off before you also you
spray<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.720> water<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> wait<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.860> half

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
spray it with water and wait maybe half

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.830 
spray it with water and wait maybe half
an<00:01:09.030> hour<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:10.700> render<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
an hour and then render it and this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.760 
an hour and then render it and this
determines<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:14.010> usually<00:01:14.549> Portland<00:01:15.060> cement

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
determines a usually Portland cement

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
determines a usually Portland cement
sand<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.390> how<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.780> mix<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.409> am<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:21.240> course

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.680 

it<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.070> very<00:02:14.430> important<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> mix<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.100> or<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
it is very important to mix it or not to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.670 
it is very important to mix it or not to
add<00:02:19.340> too<00:02:20.340> much<00:02:20.460> water<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.200> too<00:02:22.290> bad

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
add too much water to it if it's too bad

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.200 
add too much water to it if it's too bad
it<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.400> going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.760> stick

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it is not going to stick

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.550 
it is not going to stick
although<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.050> how<00:02:26.960> area<00:02:27.960> should<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
although this is how area should be it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830 
although this is how area should be it
is<00:02:31.830> very<00:02:32.070> very<00:02:32.520> easy<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.000> work<00:02:33.270> with

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
is very very easy to work with

is very very easy to work with
as<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.710> see<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> video<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:38.120> sticks

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
as you can see on this video it sticks

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
as you can see on this video it sticks
very<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.080> store<00:02:40.350> no<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.010> any<00:02:41.280> surface

also to render using this it shouldn't
cost<00:03:42.200> much<00:03:43.200> more<00:03:43.440> than<00:03:43.680> three<00:03:43.950> you

and now what I'm doing I'm Creek Rd in

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.220 
and now what I'm doing I'm Creek Rd in
point<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.400> material<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:05.970> anyway<00:04:06.420> how

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
point a material and this is anyway how

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.940 
point a material and this is anyway how
material<00:04:07.800> should<00:04:08.040> good<00:04:08.670> material<00:04:09.240> should<00:04:09.420> be

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
material should good material should be

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.690 
material should good material should be
it<00:04:10.950> should<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:11.520> thick<00:04:11.910> as<00:04:12.360> this<00:04:12.600> one<00:04:13.700> to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
it should be just thick as this one to

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:46.450 
it should be just thick as this one to
make<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.030> easy

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.260 

and<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.260> when<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.350> I'm<00:04:48.650> just<00:04:48.710> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:50.090> this

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
and now when I I'm just going to in this

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.200 
and now when I I'm just going to in this
case<00:04:50.510> I'm<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:50.780> going<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:54.160> be<00:04:55.160> sure<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.640> ome

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
case I'm just going to be sure that ome

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.640 
case I'm just going to be sure that ome
hole<00:04:56.540> has<00:04:57.320> been<00:04:57.350> filled<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:59.510> any<00:05:00.110> God<00:05:00.410> I

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
hole has been filled in and any God I

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.400 
hole has been filled in and any God I
want<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.190> put<00:05:01.340> them<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:04.180> pool<00:05:05.410> coming

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
want to put them in a pool coming

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.240 
want to put them in a pool coming
through<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.770> ball

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
through the ball

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:15.280 
through the ball
so<00:05:08.060> now<00:05:08.270> all<00:05:08.450> gaps<00:05:08.930> are<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:13.360> now<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.600> don't<00:05:15.080> want

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
so now all gaps are and now I don't want

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.900 
so now all gaps are and now I don't want
to<00:05:15.410> keep<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.770> very<00:05:15.950> fine

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
to keep it very fine

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.680 
to keep it very fine
I<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.390> some<00:05:17.960> just<00:05:18.500> more<00:05:18.800> because<00:05:19.790> I'm<00:05:20.330> going

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
to I'm going to leave it very bumpy

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.620 
to I'm going to leave it very bumpy
because<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.860> could<00:05:25.540> make<00:05:26.540> it<00:05:26.750> fine<00:05:27.020> at<00:05:27.260> once

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
because I could make it fine at once

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.210 
because I could make it fine at once
okay<00:05:29.630> but<00:05:29.870> I'm<00:05:30.080> just<00:05:30.140> going<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.710> try<00:05:31.160> this

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
okay but I'm just going to try this

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
and I'm going to say leave it just like

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
and I'm going to say leave it just like
this<00:06:02.000> in<00:06:02.870> about<00:06:03.440> five<00:06:03.830> days<00:06:04.419> I'm<00:06:05.419> not<00:06:05.479> going<00:06:05.840> to

this in about five days I'm not going to

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.860 
this in about five days I'm not going to
make<00:06:06.110> energy<00:06:06.770> finer<00:06:07.340> than<00:06:07.610> this<00:06:07.759> and<00:06:08.090> I'm

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
make energy finer than this and I'm

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.060 
make energy finer than this and I'm
going<00:06:09.139> to<00:06:09.470> align<00:06:09.860> I'm<00:06:10.280> going<00:06:10.669> to<00:06:11.949> posture<00:06:12.949> it

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
going to align I'm going to posture it

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.830 
going to align I'm going to posture it
using<00:06:13.460> all<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.669> material<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:14.389> if<00:06:14.539> like<00:06:14.720> this

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
using all the material so if like this

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.779 
using all the material so if like this
is<00:06:15.080> excellent<00:06:15.500> because<00:06:15.710> all<00:06:16.100> the<00:06:16.220> material<00:06:16.699> is

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
is excellent because all the material is

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.470 
is excellent because all the material is
going<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.120> really<00:06:17.479> stick<00:06:18.169> to<00:06:18.380> it
