00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 when I meet Mr. horton bucks 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.629
 he tells me jose if you connect to the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.970
 system for 18 months you will never have to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.730
 return to worry about money now 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.370
 he asks me what he lived ok what is the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.770
 system I want to know that system and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 the goal organ system is a system 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
 simple that anyone can 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.230
 follow 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.410
 is something very simple is composed of 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.960
 four steps and the first one is to be 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 product product we have to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 consume all products consume 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.579
 black coffee mocha body art the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.920
 spores the mais and lyon to consume all 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 the products then something key be 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.510
 Product product to count 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.420
 our own testimony the second one is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.700
 set the correct auto shipping if 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 we are opening a business one of the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 coffee things one of the things 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 humanitarian coffee then we're going to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.840
 avoid setting the first of the month by 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.210
 at least 100 points 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.220
 in coffee then make sure 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 set the correct high shipping the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.700
 another thing that we are going to do is every time 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 that we write to a person we are going to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 deliver two boxes of coffee one of the black 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 and one ahead of how we're going to give it 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.540
 at the price of how we get it out is 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.270
 something key that we have to deliver 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.760
 those two boxes of coffee the same day as 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 it is written despite step number one 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.030
 step number 2 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.130
 to develop a contact list 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.490

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.500

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.500
 I can call you 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.199

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.629
 2 and 3 the easiest thing that I have met in 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.870
 my life the four products follows 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.659
 four questions four steps the way 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.220
 towards success when I already knew the 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.560
 Mr. Horton, I asked what is the 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.620
 objective that is what they want to achieve me 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.180
 He says the goal is to capture 1% 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.550
 the coffee drinkers and what 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.009
 means means are 255 million 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.080
 people no more from North America than 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.139
 they drink three to four cups of coffee 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.330
 daily if we capture in 1% all would be 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.210
 two and a half million people taking 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.340
 our coffee if each one buy 50 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.979
 dollars in healthy coffee every month not 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.009
 we would be selling 125 million 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.069
 dollars in sales every month now the 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.440
 company pays 50 percent the 50 goes 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.440
 to be for the company and 50 for 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.210
 us and that means 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.210
 that the next three years are going to 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.900
 be distributing 62.5 million in 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.150
 earnings every month and Mr. hold on me 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.150
 jose said this we are going to do with you 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.710
 or without you said if they are going to do it without me 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.930
 better that they do it with me I want to be 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.330
 part of that because I never had 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.370
 met a billionaire who 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.350
 was determined to carry a 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.350
 visionary company and that I was 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.120
 inviting to participate and I took the 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.180
 decision to join two and a half years ago 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.310
 and has changed my life financially 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.860
 but not only my life but has 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.860
 changed the lives of thousands of people 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.420
 thanks to the decision I made two 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.960
 years and a half I hope that the day from now 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.840
 you make a good decision to join 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.520
 to join this team because remember 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.110
 in the next three years we are going to 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.510
 capture 1 percent of the 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.820
 coffee drinkers and that means that 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.500
 we will be selling 125 million 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.560
 dollars in sales every month no more in 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.720
 North America now the company pays the 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.520
 50 percent of 50 for the company and 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.900
 50 for us 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.590
 that means they are going to be 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.759
 distributing 62.5 million dollars 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:12.479
 every month I hope you decide how much 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:14.970
 you want from those 62 points 5 million 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.099
 If you have ever dreamed of being part of something 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.919

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:22.879
