00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and this was an oxygen saturation

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.970 
and this was an oxygen saturation
oh<00:00:44.309> yeah<00:00:45.920> that's<00:00:46.920> his<00:00:47.100> near<00:00:47.820> spent<00:00:48.300> that

oh yeah that's his near spent that
monitors<00:00:49.980> his<00:00:50.070> oxygen<00:00:50.610> oxygen<00:00:50.940> saturation

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
monitors his oxygen oxygen saturation

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
monitors his oxygen oxygen saturation
his<00:00:52.890> neurovascular<00:00:53.550> his<00:00:53.910> brain<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.629> his
