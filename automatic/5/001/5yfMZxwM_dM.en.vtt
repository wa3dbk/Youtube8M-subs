00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 you went from last in line to being 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.230
 holder at a stage where salons or 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.710
 he ended up playing his destiny at first 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.980
 division 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.690
 in that moment of that of that summer there 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.009
 you can only give a silver plated by the head 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.610
 the fact of having to leave San 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.500
 lorenzo 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.020
 you will have thought and I am finished 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.630
 race where will I go to play what will happen 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.190
 my future is of several fears that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 you have and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:31.350
 and the worst thing you think there is like 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 you begin to doubt your death in no 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.210
 side but then you realize that no 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.130
 it's so like that and it works to say good if 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.320
 it's not here anywhere else they go 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 to play then you start to work more 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 because like the shoe is squeezing 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.470
 it's the last chance you're going to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.840
 have and sometimes it's good for you 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.820
 because in my case I saved myself and I had the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.129
 possibility of I do not think ever neighbor 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 ruined that same semester you're going to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.460
 give the opportunity to finish if you go 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 to speak something very crazy happened to me they call me 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.489
 to rescind and I did not attend because 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.489
 I knew it was for that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.570
 because I had the expectation of long month 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.570
 and I had nothing 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.540
 I will not reverse it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.680
 for those six months of contract 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.680
 because I had nothing I had a thing of 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.750
 Japan called me some of the types of 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.670
 Japan to send you like the people 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 copy of the passport so that the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.500
 steps and it is also not mandated why 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.329
 after two days in a store 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.100
 a kind of obviously are elections 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.350
 technicians but a kind of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.789
 remorse I say you have left to like 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 madelon as for any technician 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.070
 say but without even a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.580
 opportunity 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 and the truth that I am long ago and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.260
 leo madelon I think he did not even know me 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.000
 me and I did not know him and the truth that 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.710
 if he decided that I do not know why there will be 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 been but then we have an excellent 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.470
 relationship in fact I was the date that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.750
 was the juve and the truth that I try 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
 man, I feel a little short to the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.030
 adolescence of each were the cracks 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.420
 of the neighborhood was what from the bar of the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.340
 primary school from the secondary 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.020
 they were the ones that stood out from guys and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 that the whole group looks once and I'm 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.770
 sure they are going to French players 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 football or out there they were in a neighborhood 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.640
 where or in a group of guys where 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.390
 there was one that played barbarian and touched them 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 to you the fact of arriving 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 where I was raised there was pasture there was a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.220
 group where which 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.500
 today it continues to be one 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.400
 speaks and the truth that we were very 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.470
 soccer fan but I think of those who 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 I'm talking at this moment you know 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.530
 that they knew we said 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.849
 and always be there of the middle or of what 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.110
 he plays in the neighborhood playing something else 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.060
 another thing 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.400
 always forward of reality all 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.480
 we go up the last goal was more or 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.480
 less in the English invasions 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:23.790
 and I have about 5 in the last one raised a 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.790
 cup with the last alive 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.550
 is called 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.270
 Pablo Bosch 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.150
 with your company 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.019
 as if the zones were now 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.019
 neither 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:12.969
 but if he is here because we were few 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:18.440
 but there were many play while nothing of 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:20.359
 this was a final word from the two 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.099
 He was here Friday with us to 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.660
 for someone who at this moment 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.490
 surely missing within the group as 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.650
 Paul not millions 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.660
 and the truth that 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.569
 it's a bad grace what happened to 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.719
 Pablo what is living the truth 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.089
 the short time he was finding what 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:44.169
 I'm with colleagues I've known him very 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:46.779
 well you know the kind of person that good 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.020
 always gave his support to him as well as 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:52.360
 his family and unfortunately nobody 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.539
 I would like to live what he had to live 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.939
 and the truth is that it did not get very sad 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.490
 when he found out what he was 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.560
 living but we know it was a 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.099
 very very strong person today is with his 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.780
 family and will get ahead not if I 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.310
 to thank you for the time that 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.870
 it was the truth that was always offered 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.449
 100% for the club and with us 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.909
 also and now I hope he is happy in 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.419
 whatever it is in the club that is with your 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.900
 family or whatever it takes but that 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.900
 let's be us
