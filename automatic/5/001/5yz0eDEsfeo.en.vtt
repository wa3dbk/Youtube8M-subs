00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
cards are basic Pokemon so you can put

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
cards are basic Pokemon so you can put
them<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.130> into<00:00:23.340> play<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.390> only<00:00:24.600> bad<00:00:24.810> thing

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
them right into play the only bad thing

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.839 
them right into play the only bad thing
about<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.220> put<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.490> into<00:00:26.609> play

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
about it is when you put them into play

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.070 
about it is when you put them into play
you<00:00:26.880> cannot<00:00:27.359> evolve<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.949> Pokemon<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:30.080> other

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
you cannot evolve the Pokemon into other

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.100 
you cannot evolve the Pokemon into other
evolutions<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> had<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.000> chance<00:00:33.750> Iggy

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
evolutions like if you had a chance Iggy

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
evolutions like if you had a chance Iggy
X<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> couldn't<00:00:34.920> evolve<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> into

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
X out there you couldn't evolve it into

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
X out there you couldn't evolve it into
Blissey<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> let<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.680> some

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
Blissey at all and let there are some

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.380 
Blissey at all and let there are some
cards<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.250> specifically<00:00:38.730> state<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
cards that specifically state you can

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.200 
cards that specifically state you can
but<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:39.960> likely<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.410> can't<00:00:41.210> another

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
but more than likely you can't another

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
but more than likely you can't another
one<00:00:42.809> bad<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.620> cards<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one bad thing about these cards is that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
one bad thing about these cards is that
when<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> put<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.969> play<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.450> they're

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
when you put them in play if they're

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.389 
when you put them in play if they're
knocked<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.649> opponent<00:00:47.010> gets<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> take

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
knocked out your opponent gets to take

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.720 
knocked out your opponent gets to take
to<00:00:47.640> prize<00:00:47.940> cards<00:00:48.390> instead<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
makers of the gaze cards made up for

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
makers of the gaze cards made up for
this<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.739> making<00:00:52.949> these<00:00:53.250> e^x<00:00:53.610> cards<00:00:54.000> extremely

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this by making these e^x cards extremely

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610 
this by making these e^x cards extremely
powerful<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.199> were<00:00:58.260> knocked

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
powerful so that if they were knocked

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
powerful so that if they were knocked
out<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.399> should<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.699> been<00:00:59.789> able<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> knock

level of the e X cards in the set the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
level of the e X cards in the set the
easier<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> box<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
easier it is to get in the box now I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
easier it is to get in the box now I
have<00:01:52.229> open<00:01:52.470> boxes<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> I've<00:01:53.100> gotten<00:01:53.990> three

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have open boxes that I've gotten three

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
have open boxes that I've gotten three
or<00:01:55.110> four<00:01:55.320> e^x<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> I've<00:01:56.070> opened<00:01:56.219> boxes<00:01:56.700> that's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
or four e^x and I've opened boxes that's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
or four e^x and I've opened boxes that's
that<00:01:57.240> I've<00:01:57.360> gotten<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> just

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that I've gotten maybe one in so it just

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.240 
that I've gotten maybe one in so it just
depends<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.780> set<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
depends not on the set really so it's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.510 
depends not on the set really so it's
similar<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> level<00:02:03.119> access<00:02:03.479> cards<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
similar to the level access cards so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
similar to the level access cards so
there's<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> e<00:02:06.090> X<00:02:06.390> cards<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.079> any

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
there's the e X cards if you have any

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.760 
there's the e X cards if you have any
more<00:02:07.860> questions<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.629> definitely

Pokemon and that if you look at the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.810 
Pokemon and that if you look at the
number<00:02:46.440> they're<00:02:46.830> always<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.340> close<00:02:47.670> to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the end of the set like this is 112 out

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.880 
the end of the set like this is 112 out
of<00:02:49.739> 113<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.570> these<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.870> only<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.470> some<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
of 113 so these are only in some of the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.880 
of 113 so these are only in some of the
e^x<00:02:53.310> sets<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:55.320> didn't<00:02:55.590> appear<00:02:55.860> in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
e^x sets and then they didn't appear in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.729 
e^x sets and then they didn't appear in
the<00:02:56.040> diamond<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.459> pearl<00:02:56.670> sets<00:02:57.590> they<00:02:58.590> aren't

and the a rarity the odds are about one
in<00:03:08.430> two<00:03:08.700> boxes<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.269> they<00:03:09.390> are<00:03:09.480> quite<00:03:09.690> rare<00:03:10.819> and
