00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 inns 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.909
 I have chickens and this one has a body with tomatoes I want tomato if 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.579
 you have some 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:17.689
 an exchange 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.699
 a simple exchange for example the new contract more 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.739
 that's how things were at the beginning 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.890
 but of course sometimes their tomatoes were better and others worse 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.650
 or maybe I want to buy a cavallino I had very clear how many eggs 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.829
 needs to 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.519
 but if we are as a reference for example is a simple example a bit of 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.260
 gold 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.070
 but is pretty 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 and there is not too much is valuable 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.530
 so we can make a conversion batch 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.260
 if a dozen eggs are worth the same as a gold nugget and a horse 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 Synthetic slope is easy to know that a horse is worth the same as me 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 we wanted 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.450
 there are new simple 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 gold thus becomes a bargaining chip 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 you can not buy a horse but the rest also women by coins and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 is approaching 1 lazarov 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 beteta 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 That is the first step 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.190
 that is more or less the same as the beginning 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.720
 except that now we need gold to buy the things that we drive 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 lecce meat 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.100
 this person who invented the system has an establishment 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 a place where what we want was stored 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.410
 they do not want to give us the gold, besides, chacón, lend it to us 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.560
 for example waiting for power 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 thanks to the loan for a period of 12 months 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.499
 it only requires a modest logical interest let's say start percent 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.979
 that yes thanks to his roll did not risk anything 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.959
 so you need a guarantee to cover the chances that you do not 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.769
 fulfill my part of the traffic 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769
 that would export to hit more those knives 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.709
 in your case if you also want gold and publish your garden 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.259
 so the man lends to 19 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.059
 in return in their templates 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.209
 it does not follow with its tomatoes and its green areas 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.269
 you do not have to get rid of anything you have to keep trusting 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.959
 you just have to return a fearful goal to the bank after a year 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 that they lent him without interest 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.049
 when we are dead therefore your products 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.589
 if you have a whole year 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.429
 only if he does not meet the bank he is left with a dead 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:05.659
 the agreement 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.379
 juanjuí there are problems 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
 no problem 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.409
 imagine that the bank owns a total amount of dynamo its 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.589
 which is the total amount of gold that exists 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.459
 not one more 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.499
 besides the good man we exist other 10 people 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.479
 efe 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.059
 a blacksmith or maybe a couple of ranchers a seamstress 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.149
 ten people in total 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.639
 we all need gold to buy titles we have asked for a loan 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.449
 10 coins for each 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.449
 a total of seven stars 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.680
 the banker has given us all his savings 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.400
 with absolute generosity 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.789
 And in exchange for what 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.139
 a simple 10% 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.139
 one coin per person 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.469
 But that is 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.400
 According to Pythagoras we have a problem 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.470
 if after twelve months we have to pay 11 coins each 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.629
 while we are going to take out 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.590
 15 coins each are 110 coins that means that there are 10 coins in 

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:47.319
 interests 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.469
 that can never be paid 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.469
 whatever happens 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.069
 no problem 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.139
 the bank was invented to facilitate things not to complicate the there is a 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.949
 reasonable solution 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.949
 save me only interest one coin every second 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.819
 next year 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.819
 already told me will be the amount to be initially 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.069
 the first 10 coins in short 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.289
 but nevertheless 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.309
 however if we return a coin we have nine 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.210
 see each one 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.469
 so if still 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.009
 we must foot coins 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.009
 some year we will continue with the same problem and also 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.779
 we will have less money 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.879
 some coins less than the previous year 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.360
 if we repeat the operation for ten years and that whenever they let us pass 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.159
 only of interest 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.240
 at that time 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.150
 we are left with nothing 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.330
 all the money disappeared 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.610
 however we will continue to have in this province 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.479
 the bank will have recovered all the gold 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.699
 we will not have anything 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.349
 and we will still owe what they lent us the beginning 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.119
 time that passes between all that we can never return because simply 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.499
 does not exist 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.749
 so we will have the lands 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.590
 the animals the food we mortgage as collateral the prince 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.389
 ten years ago 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.210
 in ten years the bank will have what it had at the beginning plus all our 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.229
 possessions 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.110
 we will not have anything 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.550
 absolutely nothing 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.990
 with what practice 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.419
 we will have become slaves of the bank 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.839
 and because 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.909
 and for nothing
