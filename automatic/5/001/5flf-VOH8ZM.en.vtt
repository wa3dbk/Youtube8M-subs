battle cards here and I like the best

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
battle cards here and I like the best
strategy<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> use<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.650> card

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
strategy would be to use your for card

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.960 
strategy would be to use your for card
every<00:00:20.070> time<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> highest

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
every time because it's the highest

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.460 
every time because it's the highest
number<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.539> why<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.320> oh

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
castles because it's completely

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
castles because it's completely
ineffective<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.629> holding<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.260> hand

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
ineffective when holding it in your hand

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
ineffective when holding it in your hand
now<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.219> you're<00:00:59.340> zoom<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.670> close<00:00:59.789> here

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
now if you're zoom in really close here

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
now if you're zoom in really close here
you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.870> person<00:01:01.199> decided<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you can see that this person decided to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
you can see that this person decided to
use<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> crown<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.520> he's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> regal<00:01:03.629> looking

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
use a crown which he's a regal looking
 yeah<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.159> probably<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
 yeah which is probably the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010 
 yeah which is probably the
best<00:01:05.909> situation<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.510> when<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
best situation here when you have to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.750 
best situation here when you have to
open<00:01:07.380> castles<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> best<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
open castles the best thing to do is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
open castles the best thing to do is
avoid<00:01:08.790> both<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.229> notice

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
avoid both of them if you'll notice

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
avoid both of them if you'll notice
there<00:01:10.740> someone<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> fisting<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> ocean

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that's uh that's a very strategic naval

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's uh that's a very strategic naval
maneuver<00:01:16.140> I've<00:01:16.320> seen<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> done<00:01:16.670> America<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
maneuver I've seen it done America I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.929 
maneuver I've seen it done America I
