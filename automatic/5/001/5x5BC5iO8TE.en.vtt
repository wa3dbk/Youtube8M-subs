00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 5 in excel version 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 I'll give you a post by 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 show rockstar games in which many 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810
 we have new features in it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.180
 not yet knew what the gta 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
 5 next to the west but before that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 a little story about this post 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 and that has a gta 5 player in the social 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.070
 club forum asked what all new 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.810
 at the gta 5 next anderson is there 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 and rockstar games also has this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 post answered and just a lot of information 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.250
 rausgehauen actually still 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.870
 was to be kept secret because of that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.100
 this post also a few minutes after 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.290
 publish again 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 taken out but of course have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.050
 some user made screenshots of it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 is in any case really like times 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.059
 again really fat appeal from 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 rockstar games 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.149
 and yes I have it in any case 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.649
 pretty celebrated but i would say 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.629
 we'll just come to the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 Design of this post I will be you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 now a screenshot of the post 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 objections and as you can see was 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 to ask what if to see everything new 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.180
 get in the gta 5 next version 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 and as I said rockstar games 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.080
 just answered this post and have 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 their own of them listed as example 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.439
 I find a first person on everyone 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.610
 fall off a pretty cool thing because 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.560
 you do not have to clap anymore 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.630
 or tomorrow just to be in the first person 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 perspective to play but what else 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.600
 a lot cooler is when you're in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 this first person in a vehicle 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 then you can plug in as well 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 see a speedometer and that is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 really a cause of evil celebration then 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 switzerland does not care if it suits you 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 will we have at the very least so that it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 always wanted to know how 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 fast you actually travels in gta 5 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 and therefore a pretty cool thing 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 in my opinion, moreover, it will 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.490
 new easter eggs and events for the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.049
 Giving story mode is also a thing 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.549
 I think I'm pretty cool 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.200
 personally, an extreme is pretty 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 exciting also think it is new 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.850
 Animal species for going online and giving 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 then a little thing for the xbox 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 360 and ps3 players so the people the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.220
 now gta and play because 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 These will be on the next version 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 free weapons and free garages 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.829
 and then there will be another 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 to give new character selection screen 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.439
 is not such an exciting thing now 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.850
 but also good to know 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.079
 I think it's pretty cool anyway 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.219
 rockstar games like that again 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.110
 made a mistake 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.430
 and we would like to be in the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 Comments write what you mean 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.710
 I would be correct in any case 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.570
 interested and then I would like 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.680
 Of course I always hope that it will 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.300
 If you like it then you liked it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.560
 he beat one to the like button 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.330
 and then I would say until the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.330
 Next time, skin purely or creamy
