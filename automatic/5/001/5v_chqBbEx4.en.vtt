00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.210
 good morning to all friends and enemies 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.090
 Professor's channel readers today 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.200
 we review xy by sandro veronesi 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.540
 here it is fandango liters, that is fandango 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.550
 as the best informed know is saying 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.010
 Veronese founded it together with Domenico 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.920
 mixed food where it is not already mentioned 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.900
 several things I read the first book for 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.529
 where this cheerful train leaves a lot 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.570
 cute 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.890
 I must say I admit that I have a weakness 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.870
 for books that exhibit a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 hendecasyllable in the type title precisely 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.949
 for where part what you find cheerful or 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.559
 I do not know the literature of Italy united of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.900
 keep in mind something like this, in other words, nice and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.720
 the cute also come come b52 a 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.309
 another youthful book though 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.930
 unanimously felt like 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.659
 masterpiece the strength of the word a little 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.369
 big calm chaos of young people true in 19 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.019
 months and excuse me, calm chaos 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.720
 actually it's a nice book starts with 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.250
 a powerful scene of a rescue 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.890
 perhaps the effect that a little too long 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.809
 verbose word for word, however it is a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.659
 book that is worth reading too 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.670
 if it has already had its time in 2006 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.040
 but happy with calm chaos 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.140
 I gladly approached xy 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.110
 also attracted shovel aspects 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.720
 textual so to speak pretty in fact 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.510
 as you can see the cover is a field 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.420
 white with red xy these colors 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.920
 are also included in the back of the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.200
 full cover observe and 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.150
 would stretch the colors to a fact of 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.009
 blood because this is a yellow or 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.720
 at least he would like to be a mystery 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.130
 in the intention of the author who does not 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.890
 always correspond to reality as 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.740
 a well known fact of blood happens e 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.590
 not country of the trentino borgo san giuda è 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.770
 a really interesting thing about blood 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.530
 for readers a massacre and people do 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.720
 will find out then she died in the circumstances 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.210
 more disparate at the same time who 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 devoured by a shark who killed by a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.390
 who happened to cancer and others too 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.720
 to my back that centered thousand 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.130
 in short, the beginning therefore disappeared e 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 fascinating also because world 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.220
 cinematographic 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.049
 in the first pages we see 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.000
 of the inscription from the top of borgo san 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.880
 then the snowmobile leads to campolungo 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 arrives announces the massacre the pages 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.810
 description of the very beautiful massacre 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.370
 through the narrative voice of duty 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.530
 a priest among the village priest 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 post conciliate as it defines itself 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.170
 so far, so good 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.680
 pity that then nothing does not happen 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.959
 have nothing 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.090
 well you say but like he never read 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.709
 it will go even in the minimum not 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.720
 nothing will count 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.840
 also in the last of jacopo ortis alla 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 end tight nothing happens 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.079
 yes okay those are also in novels 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.660
 nothing to say but to do a 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.220
 anti-novel you must be a novelist 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.950
 so good to be able to deny the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.920
 novel and it does not seem the case we say 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.049
 veronesi the narrative structure that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.570
 are veronesi puts in feet and to the 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.650
 at the same time simple but very difficult to 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.489
 read there are two narrative voices 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.500
 proustianamente that in dialogue for so 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.260
 say tell from different points of 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.329
 given what happens the psychiatrist la 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.819
 dr. giovanna gassion discovered 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.300
 tribute to edith piaf is the real name 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.850
 of the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.410
 celebrated of course could not 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.250
 to refrain from saying gives us to remember 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.340
 the author and don ermete the priest among the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.340
 two there is obviously an envelope you know 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.490
 cruz is the sexual tension is resolved 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.930
 a bit like solving seksu at the sun 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.160
 a bit like the release is maybe a bit like 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.350
 it happens for example precisely for these 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.960
 of files and of course it doesn't happen 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.760
 nothing at least in the passion type harmony 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.980
 shark in the sense that is here instead 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 practically nothing 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.240
 but above all and here we are at point II 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.940
 yellow practically I say it immediately 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.220
 and so the book burns from the solution 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.880
 now for charity there may be gods 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.230
 yellows without solution but to produce 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.500
 a yellow without solution you have to be in 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.440
 leg must be camilleri must be 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.540
 sciascia hard pleasure however the mat 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.340
 quoted in the epigraph at the beginning that the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.320
 world did not make sense we already knew 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.020
 after all, after twenty years of government 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.710
 Berlusconi doesn't seem to have it 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.919
 so much sense and on the other hand the reader 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.570
 remains disappointed indeed I would like to say more 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.060
 enraged at having wasted time by 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.230
 psychic energy to then understand that not 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.919
 there is no solution or better the 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.440
 solution that is a miracle maybe 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.060
 belzebù hence the horns to review the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.100
 book 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.260
 well both the voices protagonists 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.460
 internal operators pursue the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.090
 their catharsis well but those dicks would remain 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.680
 to say now maybe there is a good reason 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.630
 actually to buy the book is 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.200
 free does not even have a particular one 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.180
 linguistic search for my calm chaos 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.100
 showed some work on the words that 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.960
 here, on the other hand, is definitely missing, if anything 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.919
 reason to buy the book is the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.050
 bonus track 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.880
 in fact in the last pages there is a 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.730
 wonderful story one of the most moments 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.860
 high of the Italian disheveled prose the 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.460
 story of arrigo of arrigo boito 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.720
 black luzier a great story and in 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.590
 this really central story 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.590
 well 3 nov
