00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.179

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.640

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.589

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.539

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.920

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 Well then to open the egg is what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.160
 what we have to do is remove this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.260
 super comfortable my friends are going to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.250
 many candies that are super good 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.650
 but I eat the indexes after the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 food is nothing to eat is the before 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.710
 then we go to hunger 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.710
 Well, I'm going to leave my super here 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.140

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.200
 open the 'dora the explorer' that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 there will be more candy then will 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.110
 often we will know we have to remove this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 let's see if I find where by here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.170
 example 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.670
 out the sticker 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.579
 and we press like this and see what will make us 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.439
 inside or the music in more candies and 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.959
 that returns our where colors and I 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.939
 I think in chocolate take it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.370
 Well, I'm going to leave you with the 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.849
 other candies I want to hope that more 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.849
 things 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.840
 walk like this is Dora's backpack you know 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.459
 what dora whenever you go to explore the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.860
 world does it accompanied by his backpack 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.040
 where you have everything you need 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.250
 How nice to see how nice she is 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.140
 here I leave the backpack and now I think that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.790
 I 'm going to stay eating two or three 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.730
 These balls have very good 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.680
 paints set with my angry bracelet 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.000
 birds that I loved and I think 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 that fits me really well and that is very 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.530
 comfortable so nothing I hope that I have 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.270

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.769
