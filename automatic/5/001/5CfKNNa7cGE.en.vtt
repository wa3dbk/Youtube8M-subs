you're going to be taken over to the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
you're going to be taken over to the
first<00:01:15.330> page<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> site<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> steel

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
first page of the site this is the steel

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.420 
first page of the site this is the steel
detailed<00:01:17.820> page<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.070> put

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
detailed page and you can see I have put

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.940 
detailed page and you can see I have put
pictures<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.450> detailed<00:01:21.930> diagrams<00:01:22.560> with

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
pictures out with detailed diagrams with

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
pictures out with detailed diagrams with
dimensions<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.659> believe<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.290> would

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
dimensions and I believe that this would

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
dimensions and I believe that this would
probably<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> best<00:01:27.240> place<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> go

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
probably be the best place for you to go

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
probably be the best place for you to go
if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> ran<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:28.710> trouble<00:01:29.189> while<00:01:29.579> watching

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
if you ran into trouble while watching

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
if you ran into trouble while watching
the<00:01:30.210> DVD<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.470> I've<00:01:34.770> diagrammed

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the DVD you can see that I've diagrammed

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670 
the DVD you can see that I've diagrammed
most<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.909> connections<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> log<00:01:37.290> splitter

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
most the connections in the log splitter

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.710 
most the connections in the log splitter
so<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.880> happen<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.509> some

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so if you do happen to have some

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
so if you do happen to have some
questions<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> first<00:01:40.950> place

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
questions this would be the first place

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:52.250 
questions this would be the first place
you<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.729> go
