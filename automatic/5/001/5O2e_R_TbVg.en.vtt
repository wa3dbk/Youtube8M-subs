device<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.920> once<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.150> need<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
device so once we do that you need to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.609 
device so once we do that you need to
make<00:01:36.479> sure<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.079> back<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.320> your

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
make sure that you actually back up your

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.780 
make sure that you actually back up your
device<00:01:37.680> information<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
device information and all of that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
device information and all of that
before<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.689> next<00:01:39.930> step<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.500> if

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
before you go to that next step and if

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
before you go to that next step and if
you're<00:01:41.009> comfortable<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> next

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you're comfortable with that the next

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
you're comfortable with that the next
thing<00:01:42.150> we're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> turn<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:42.930> our

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
thing we're going to do is turn off our

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.789 
thing we're going to do is turn off our
device

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.990 

will<00:01:50.799> feel<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> vibration<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.729> once<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
will feel a vibration and once the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.240 
will feel a vibration and once the
device<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.450> off<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:53.140> hold<00:01:53.350> volume<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.979> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
device is off you hold volume up and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.710 
device is off you hold volume up and
power<00:01:54.700> at<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.060> same<00:01:55.240> time<00:02:00.539> you'll<00:02:01.539> feel

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
power at the same time you'll feel

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120 
power at the same time you'll feel
slight<00:02:02.020> vibration<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:02.829> you're<00:02:02.979> going

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
slight vibration and then you're going

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.109 
slight vibration and then you're going
to<00:02:03.189> be<00:02:03.310> able<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.549> see<00:02:03.729> this<00:02:03.909> little

to be able to see this little

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.480 
to be able to see this little
CyanogenMod<00:02:05.020> logo<00:02:05.350> right<00:02:05.500> here<00:02:05.560> we'll<00:02:06.310> put

next thing we're going to do is actually

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.140 
next thing we're going to do is actually
go<00:02:10.630> into<00:02:10.810> our<00:02:10.989> device<00:02:11.200> itself<00:02:11.680> actually<00:02:12.150> back

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
go into our device itself actually back

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 
go into our device itself actually back
on<00:02:13.269> our<00:02:13.480> PC<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.989> we'll<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.250> able<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.459> actually

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
on our PC and we'll be able to actually

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.040 
on our PC and we'll be able to actually
unlock<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.150> bootloader<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.989> be

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050

unlock the bootloader it's going to be
the<00:02:17.140> first<00:02:17.290> thing<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:17.769> next<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.430> need<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
the first thing but next we need to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.370 
the first thing but next we need to
first<00:02:18.819> connect<00:02:19.090> our<00:02:19.209> device<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.900> your<00:02:26.080> drivers

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
first connect our device if your drivers

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.199 
first connect our device if your drivers
were<00:02:26.500> installed<00:02:26.799> correctly<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.489> wouldn't

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
were installed correctly you wouldn't

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.460 
were installed correctly you wouldn't
have<00:02:28.299> any<00:02:28.450> notification<00:02:29.049> your<00:02:29.140> system

have any notification your system

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.140 
have any notification your system
installs<00:02:29.769> all<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.099> drivers<00:02:30.310> next<00:02:31.030> we're

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
installs all the drivers next we're

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.610 
installs all the drivers next we're
going<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.299> go<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.810> actually<00:02:32.019> initiate<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
going to go in and actually initiate the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770 
going to go in and actually initiate the
command<00:02:32.920> says<00:02:33.099> unlock<00:02:33.400> bootloader<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.599> gives

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
command says unlock bootloader it gives

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.210 
command says unlock bootloader it gives
us<00:02:34.930> warning<00:02:35.200> message<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.709> basically<00:02:36.010> make

us warning message just basically make

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.770 
us warning message just basically make
sure<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.880> know<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.239> device<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.660> in

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
sure that you know the device is in

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.150 
sure that you know the device is in
fastboot<00:02:38.170> mode<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:38.769> your<00:02:38.920> information

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
fastboot mode and then your information

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.339 
fastboot mode and then your information
will<00:02:39.549> be<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.030> know<00:02:40.120> obviously<00:02:40.480> wiped<00:02:40.750> we'll

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
will be you know obviously wiped we'll

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
will be you know obviously wiped we'll
click<00:02:41.530> OK

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
click OK

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.670 
click OK
so<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.810> actually<00:02:43.840> unlock<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
so now that we actually unlock the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.050 
so now that we actually unlock the
bootloader<00:02:44.799> we<00:02:45.250> notice<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.760> giving<00:02:45.970> us

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
bootloader we notice that it's giving us

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.229 
bootloader we notice that it's giving us
the<00:02:46.180> options<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:46.810> through<00:02:48.030> what's<00:02:49.030> good

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
the options of going through what's good

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.720 
the options of going through what's good
we're<00:02:49.840> going<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.049> say<00:02:50.200> skip<00:02:50.560> go<00:02:51.190> say<00:02:51.370> Next<00:02:51.610> Next

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
we're going to say skip go say Next Next

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.220 
we're going to say skip go say Next Next
Next<00:02:51.849> magnetics<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.750> way<00:02:52.870> let<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
Next magnetics all the way let the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.539 
Next magnetics all the way let the
device<00:02:53.500> sets<00:02:53.769> itself<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:58.799> ok<00:02:59.799> we're<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.489> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
device sets itself up ok we're going to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.069 
device sets itself up ok we're going to
disconnect<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.000> device<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.450> more<00:03:01.600> time<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
disconnect the device one more time and

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.210 
disconnect the device one more time and
then<00:03:02.230> at<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.470> point<00:03:02.650> we're<00:03:02.859> going<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> shut

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
then at this point we're going to shut

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.840 
then at this point we're going to shut
it<00:03:03.250> down<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:03.940> back<00:03:04.090> into<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.450> bootloader

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.289 

wait<00:03:09.850> for<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.060> vibration<00:03:11.609> ok<00:03:12.609> now<00:03:13.030> we'll<00:03:13.180> do

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
wait for the vibration ok now we'll do

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.640 
wait for the vibration ok now we'll do
the<00:03:13.420> same<00:03:13.569> thing<00:03:13.630> again<00:03:14.579> up<00:03:15.579> power<00:03:16.560> feel<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the same thing again up power feel the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.720 
the same thing again up power feel the
vibration<00:03:18.420> leave<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.680> ok<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:20.859> we're<00:03:21.400> back<00:03:21.430> in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
vibration leave it ok so we're back in

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.830 
vibration leave it ok so we're back in
the<00:03:21.790> boot<00:03:21.940> into<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.720> fat<00:03:22.989> into<00:03:23.200> fastboot<00:03:24.840> we

the boot into the fat into fastboot we

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.569 
the boot into the fat into fastboot we
connected<00:03:26.230> our<00:03:26.290> device<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.980> device<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.430> still

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579

connected our device the device is still
sitting<00:03:27.850> in<00:03:27.910> fastboot<00:03:28.389> we're<00:03:28.630> going<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.810> go<00:03:28.900> in

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
sitting in fastboot we're going to go in

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.300 
sitting in fastboot we're going to go in
here<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.260> actually<00:03:29.410> change<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.010> actual

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
here and actually change the actual
