00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 So the engine 6g 7 ec2 do the replacement 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.179
 camshaft valve seals remove 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:20.539
 no, well, we have already removed the beam on 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.269
 which held hydrojacks and 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.779
 removed one spring 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.640
 here it is one spring without 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:37.260
 spring that is old gland stands 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 which will change shut up 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 all the extra holes with cloths 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 there was not a single detail since 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.149
 the details are very fly we decided 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 err and shut up all 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:03.469
 with rags here we have here 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.469
 axes themselves and rocker with 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.180
 hydrojacking one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.220
 hydrocompensator soaks our diesel fuel 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.930
 use when washing 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.890
 hydrocompensators on diesel only 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.759
 fuel as it is very details of them 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 Do not rinse with solvent. 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.960
 the metal will be dry and will bully 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.420
 when washing the diesel fuel is very 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.180
 soft and has the properties of lubrication and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.640
 so now we will produce 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.450
 eat old gland as very 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.980
 uncomfortable and no 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.880
 special pullers we use 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.450
 normal chisel 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.970
 it was used wood processing 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:11.290
 but we have adapted for removing oil seals 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:14.550
 valves you see weed very successful 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.240
 well removed under the chisel laid 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.430
 rag not to screw up the camshaft 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.600
 as if we take it will 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.650
 troubles here are the ballies removed there 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:40.660
 there is still rubbish now we remove it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 tweezers removed tweezers now 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:53.890
 fill new glands it with us 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:55.720
 the intake manifold itself take nicke for 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.980
 intake manifold 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.980
 here they are themselves prone in the original so 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.709
 recommends using oil seals 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 valves 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.709
 original so that there is no oil consumption 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 Now he salnichek we need it 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:33.150
 lubricate the engine oil so as not to lift 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:39.510
 the inner on the gum itself is not to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.080
 all well smeared with a finger missed 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.080
 now produce 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:55.070
 installation of the gland inlet valve 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.070
 collector so we dress neatly 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.890
 all the way with the sleeve 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:14.400
 In fact, the most important thing is to use the tube 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:17.060
 so that it is so that the edges are smooth 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:27.560
 without scoring so as not to tear 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:37.080
 gland need to use four more 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:41.039
 to conveniently insert the pin and 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 watch for a gland so we have it 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.780
 sits in the seat 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:24.760
 Well here's a new salnichek we sit 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:28.920
 everything turned out neatly but without 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.780
 using special tools 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:44.920
 raised valve will now wear 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:48.610
 spring and for rusk vat valve inserted 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:55.590
 the spring with the plate will now be 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.590
 use a special puller for 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:06.870
 valves here it is for VAZ 2112 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:09.310
 we took him a little bit finished shot 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.240
 put the usual bushings 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.770
 bolts since we have places uncomfortable we 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.790
 he turned a little 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:23.130
 so that the lever will be more comfortable now 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.130
 use it for this engine on
