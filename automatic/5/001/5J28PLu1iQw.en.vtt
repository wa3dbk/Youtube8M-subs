00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 How come no one has ever tried to be a Super-Hero? 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.400
 I do not know, probably because it's impossible. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.100
 Put on a mask and help people How can that be impossible? 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
 Dude, if you did that in real life they would kick your ass. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 Oh no, I'm just walking around here ... 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
 ...No I'm not! 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400
 I was a normal boy. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 -Hello beauty. -Hello! 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 My only superpower was to be invisible to girls. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.400
 The comics were wrong ... 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.900
 You do not need a power to be a Super-Hero! 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 - Leave him alone! -This is not your business. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.800
 Of course it is! 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.900
 There's a man dressed like a Superhero hitting a bunch of guys! 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 -Who you are? -I'm Kick-Ass. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 Kick-Ass has become the latest internet phenomenon. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.100
 Is incredible. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
 Actually, it's pretty good. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 It should be called "Rear kicked". 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.000
 It has inspired a series of real-life Super-Heroes. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
 Pay attention, honey. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.200
 It's time to catch the bad guys. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 -Do you want to fight crime a bit ?. -Let's see what you can do. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.100
 This guy came out of nowhere! 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.400
 He must be the guy who looks like Batman. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.400
 You're telling me that one man did all this. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.100
 I must send a public message: 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 "That being a Super-Hero is bad for your health." 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.900
 THEY CAN NOT SEE THROUGH THE WALLS 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 So you want to play. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.950
 -Who you are? -I'm Hit-Girl. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.200
 And that, it's Big-Dady. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.900
 THEY CAN NOT FLY 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 -Kick-Ass -Red-Mist! 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 Ahh, that's going to hurt. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500
 BUT YOU CAN KICK THE BACK 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.850
 Yes !, I think I'm in love with her friend. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.900
 I want this place closed ... 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.300
 No one enters and nobody leaves. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 She is just a little girl. 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 THIS YEAR 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.100
 THE SUPER 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.000
 Ahead! 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.800
 YOU CAN SUCK IT 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.200
 Oh yeah! You did not see that coming, right? 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 It's true, We're Super-Heroes! 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
