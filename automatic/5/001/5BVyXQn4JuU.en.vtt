alright<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.750> in<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.110> tutorial<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.800> going

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
alright guys in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.439 
alright guys in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:02.070> be<00:00:02.159> teaching<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.909> make<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> pickup

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
to be teaching you how to make a pickup

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.080 
to be teaching you how to make a pickup
item<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> have<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.620> add<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.580> inventory

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
item and have that add to the inventory

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
item and have that add to the inventory
so<00:00:09.090> first<00:00:09.360> we're<00:00:09.870> gonna<00:00:10.010> you<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:11.519> back

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
so first we're gonna you want to go back

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
so first we're gonna you want to go back
to<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:11.910> inventory<00:00:12.120> script<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.080> have

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to your inventory script and if you have

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.160 
to your inventory script and if you have
that<00:00:13.380> line<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.740> code<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:15.289> dash<00:00:16.289> goes<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:17.060> so

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
that line of code just dash goes out so

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.070 
that line of code just dash goes out so
we<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.350> test<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> script

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.919 

and<00:00:23.170> then<00:00:24.359> we're<00:00:25.359> going<00:00:25.449> to<00:00:25.539> be<00:00:25.660> adding<00:00:25.900> to

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
and then we're going to be adding to

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.710 
and then we're going to be adding to
this<00:00:26.199> is<00:00:26.439> ontriggerenter<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.359> when<00:00:28.599> the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
this is ontriggerenter so when the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.549 
this is ontriggerenter so when the
player<00:00:28.929> collides<00:00:29.679> with<00:00:29.890> this<00:00:30.160> object<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:32.410> are

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
player collides with this object we are

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.590 
player collides with this object we are
going<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.220> add<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:34.239> our<00:00:34.269> inventory<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.850> pretty

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
going to add to our inventory so pretty

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.270 
going to add to our inventory so pretty
much<00:00:37.780> what<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.079> code<00:00:38.290> does<00:00:38.320> is<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.860> checks

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
much what this code does is it checks

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.720 
much what this code does is it checks
the<00:00:39.670> inventory<00:00:39.909> script<00:00:40.870> right<00:00:41.620> here<00:00:41.650> that<00:00:42.610> we

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
the inventory script right here that we

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.689 
the inventory script right here that we
have<00:00:42.879> our<00:00:42.909> inventory<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:45.430> it

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
have our inventory on and then it

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.780 
have our inventory on and then it
checked<00:00:46.390> our<00:00:46.629> adds<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.769> inventory<00:00:48.250> array

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
checked our adds to the inventory array

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.700 
checked our adds to the inventory array
in<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.720> first<00:00:50.199> slot<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:52.050> inventory<00:00:53.050> right<00:00:53.350> and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
in the first slot so inventory right and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.610 
in the first slot so inventory right and
you<00:00:54.579> want<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.970> make<00:00:55.570> any<00:00:55.600> variable<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.469> you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
you want to make any variable that you

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.189 
you want to make any variable that you
want<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.859> transfer<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.699> any<00:00:58.300> other<00:00:58.539> script<00:00:58.989> a

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
want to transfer to any other script a

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.660 
want to transfer to any other script a
static<00:00:59.680> object<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.300> yeah<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.629> pretty<00:01:04.750> much

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
static object so yeah so pretty much

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.820 
static object so yeah so pretty much
when<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.880> player<00:01:07.119> collides<00:01:07.570> with<00:01:08.170> this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
when the player collides with this

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.900 
when the player collides with this
object<00:01:09.310> it'll<00:01:10.210> add<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.619> array<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.100> then

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
object it'll add to the array and then

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.999 
object it'll add to the array and then
it<00:01:13.240> will<00:01:13.479> destroy<00:01:13.990> itself<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.800> player

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
it will destroy itself so the player

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.400 
it will destroy itself so the player
can't<00:01:15.640> pick<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:15.910> up<00:01:16.060> anymore<00:01:16.330> so<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:17.259> pretty

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
can't pick it up anymore so it's pretty

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.190 
can't pick it up anymore so it's pretty
much<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.649> one-time<00:01:18.220> pickup<00:01:18.910> item

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.760 

so<00:01:23.159> next<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.549> we'll<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.770> create

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so next thing we'll want to do is create

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.690 
so next thing we'll want to do is create
a<00:01:26.130> cube<00:01:27.140> now<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> tried<00:01:28.500> doing<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a cube now I tried doing this with the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
a cube now I tried doing this with the
cubes<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> physics<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.399> them<00:01:32.610> but

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
cubes that have the physics on them but

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.660 
cubes that have the physics on them but
I<00:01:32.850> forgot<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.299> trigger<00:01:34.460> disables<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
I forgot that trigger disables the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
I forgot that trigger disables the
physics<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.330> they<00:01:36.509> fall<00:01:36.750> through<00:01:37.159> which<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
physics so they fall through which is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.690 
physics so they fall through which is
something<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.899> happen<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> I'm

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
something we don't want to happen so I'm

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.070 
something we don't want to happen so I'm
going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.270> figure<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.690> out<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
going to have to figure that out for a

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.810 
going to have to figure that out for a
different<00:01:43.409> tutorial<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.039> get<00:01:44.310> physics

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
different tutorial how to get physics

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
different tutorial how to get physics
and<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> pickup<00:01:46.710> item<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.310> well<00:01:48.979> I'm

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and have it be a pickup item as well I'm

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.539 
and have it be a pickup item as well I'm
guessing<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.789> just<00:01:51.030> attach<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.720> trigger

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
guessing I can just attach a trigger

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.109 
guessing I can just attach a trigger
around<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.420> physics<00:01:54.840> object<00:01:55.819> or<00:01:56.819> do

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
around the physics object or do

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.160 
around the physics object or do
something<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.869> matter<00:01:59.509> but<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.539> this<00:02:00.780> we'll

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
something that matter but for this we'll

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.350 
something that matter but for this we'll
just<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.490> set<00:02:03.179> is<00:02:03.450> trigger<00:02:04.429> and<00:02:05.429> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
just use this so set is trigger and then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.460 
just use this so set is trigger and then
what<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.929> want<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.679> is<00:02:08.330> make<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.810> pickup

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
what we want to do is make this a pickup

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.809 
what we want to do is make this a pickup
item

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.830 

so<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.629> here<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.349> set<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.640> two

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so you see here it's set for one and two

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.740 
so you see here it's set for one and two
but<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.019> we<00:02:20.290> walk<00:02:20.620> over<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:20.950> our<00:02:21.299> health<00:02:22.299> potion

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
but if we walk over it our health potion

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.860 
but if we walk over it our health potion
went<00:02:22.959> up<00:02:23.049> by<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.090> mean<00:02:25.329> you<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.569> scatter

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
went up by one so I mean you can scatter

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.630 
went up by one so I mean you can scatter
these<00:02:26.170> around<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.040> whatever<00:02:27.219> you<00:02:27.430> want

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
these around or do whatever you want

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.050 
these around or do whatever you want
with<00:02:27.790> them<00:02:27.969> and<00:02:28.230> uh<00:02:29.230> later<00:02:29.799> tutorials<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.730> am

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
with them and uh later tutorials I am

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.869 
with them and uh later tutorials I am
going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:32.159> talk<00:02:33.159> about<00:02:33.340> how<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> actually

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
going to talk about how to actually

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.599 
going to talk about how to actually
scroll<00:02:34.510> through<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.200> menu<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.920> select

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
scroll through this menu and select

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.080 
scroll through this menu and select
different<00:02:36.790> items<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:39.609> all<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.939> stuff<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
different items and all that stuff and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.819 
different items and all that stuff and
yeah<00:02:43.090> we'll<00:02:43.420> work<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.079> a<00:02:44.109> more<00:02:44.349> complex

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
yeah we'll work on a more complex

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.410 
yeah we'll work on a more complex
inventory<00:02:45.340> system<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.239> add<00:02:46.389> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
inventory system we can add a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.830 
inventory system we can add a
description<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.980> each<00:02:48.310> item<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> when<00:02:49.720> we

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
description to each item so when we

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.330 
description to each item so when we
scroll<00:02:50.079> through<00:02:50.139> it<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.799> tell<00:02:51.010> us<00:02:51.159> exactly

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
scroll through it can tell us exactly

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.929 
scroll through it can tell us exactly
what<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.030> item<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:54.340> we'll<00:02:54.549> be<00:02:54.700> able

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
what the item is and then we'll be able

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.379 
what the item is and then we'll be able
to<00:02:55.439> use<00:02:56.439> that<00:02:56.650> item<00:02:57.010> as<00:02:57.159> well<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.970> wanted<00:02:58.329> to

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
to use that item as well if we wanted to

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.190 
to use that item as well if we wanted to
so<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.129> just<00:03:00.400> another<00:03:00.720> basic<00:03:01.720> tutorial

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
so this is just another basic tutorial

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.199 
so this is just another basic tutorial
how<00:03:02.439> to<00:03:02.470> set<00:03:02.919> up<00:03:03.010> an<00:03:03.189> inventory<00:03:03.459> system<00:03:03.849> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
how to set up an inventory system and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.280 
how to set up an inventory system and
how<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.359> pick<00:03:04.569> up<00:03:05.189> items<00:03:06.189> around<00:03:06.459> your<00:03:06.669> scene

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
how to pick up items around your scene

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.479 
how to pick up items around your scene
so<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.650> don't<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:08.889> what<00:03:09.069> I'm<00:03:09.129> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.310> be

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
so I don't know what I'm going to be

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.589 
so I don't know what I'm going to be
doing<00:03:09.730> if<00:03:09.970> I'm<00:03:10.120> going<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.329> figure<00:03:10.419> out<00:03:10.540> how<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
doing if I'm going to figure out how to

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.759 
doing if I'm going to figure out how to
how<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.629> make<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.319> pick<00:03:14.500> up<00:03:14.590> these

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
how to make it so you can pick up these

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.500 
how to make it so you can pick up these
boxes<00:03:15.010> well<00:03:15.579> because<00:03:15.879> it's<00:03:16.060> kind<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.299> weird

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
boxes well because it's kind of weird

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.619 
boxes well because it's kind of weird
when<00:03:16.659> you're<00:03:16.810> working<00:03:17.079> with<00:03:17.109> physics<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:17.859> well

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
when you're working with physics as well

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.180 
when you're working with physics as well
but<00:03:19.629> yeah<00:03:19.810> stay<00:03:20.319> tuned<00:03:20.530> for<00:03:20.829> later<00:03:21.609> tutorials
