00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.070 
not from the drift mod um they don't
drift<00:01:45.830> really<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.640> well<00:01:46.909> as<00:01:47.180> these<00:01:47.540> cars<00:01:47.840> here

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
drift really as well as these cars here

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.210 
drift really as well as these cars here
I<00:01:48.140> don't<00:01:48.200> know<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.710> physics<00:01:49.130> that

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
I don't know if it's the physics that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.740 
I don't know if it's the physics that
are<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:50.170> models<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.470> um<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.750> really

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
are in these models but um I really

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.980 
are in these models but um I really
don't<00:01:53.900> know<00:01:54.140> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
don't know and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
don't know and
I<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.740> touch<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> little<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.460> later

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I will touch on that a little bit later

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149 
I will touch on that a little bit later
but<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> tune<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.899> run<00:01:58.159> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but this is the tune that I run for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
but this is the tune that I run for
majority<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.909> my<00:02:00.030> cars<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.720> standard

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
majority of my cars this is a standard

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.960 
majority of my cars this is a standard
tune<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> should<00:02:01.950> work<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> lot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
tune that should work on a lot of the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.330 
tune that should work on a lot of the
cars<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.330> are<00:02:03.390> from<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.320> project<00:02:04.830> D<00:02:05.009> drift

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
cars that are from the project D drift

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.690 
cars that are from the project D drift
lon

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
lon

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
lon
so<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.149> lot<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> 240s<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.740> skyline

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so a lot of the 240s on the skyline

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
so a lot of the 240s on the skyline
stuff<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.849> will<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.780> B

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
stuff like that will work right the so B

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.400 
stuff like that will work right the so B
is<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:12.030> yeah<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.420> whatever<00:02:12.750> reason<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
is but yeah so whatever reason like the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.370 
is but yeah so whatever reason like the
350s<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.459> Supra<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.209> rx-7<00:02:15.660> stuff<00:02:16.260> like

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
350s the Supra is the rx-7 stuff like

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.930 
350s the Supra is the rx-7 stuff like
that<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.709> don't<00:02:17.099> work

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
that they don't work

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.930 
that they don't work
with<00:02:18.660> my<00:02:19.349> setup<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.130> I'm<00:02:20.220> using<00:02:20.459> right<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.910> I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
with my setup that I'm using right so I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.070 
with my setup that I'm using right so I
don't<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.540> what<00:02:21.750> I'm<00:02:21.870> doing

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
don't know what it is what I'm doing

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.190 
don't know what it is what I'm doing
wrong<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.280> um<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.239> just<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> force

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
wrong but um I just like the force

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
wrong but um I just like the force
feedback<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.860> general<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.280> doesn't<00:02:26.670> feel

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
feedback in general it doesn't feel

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.380 
feedback in general it doesn't feel
right

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
right

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.880 
right
it<00:02:27.480> doesn't<00:02:27.870> feel<00:02:28.019> like<00:02:28.080> these<00:02:28.410> cars<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.860> I

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it doesn't feel like these cars do I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.210 
it doesn't feel like these cars do I
don't<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.120> um<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:31.319> mean<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
don't know what it is but um I mean I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640 
don't know what it is but um I mean I
