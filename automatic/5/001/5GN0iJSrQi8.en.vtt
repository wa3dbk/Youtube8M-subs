00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.760
 very good two kids that just like 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.550
 you are here on the ship of 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.830
 taiwan leave i'm a gameplay with the a 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.660
 in the beige 94 kilo with the search engine 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.290
 whites and the unsheathed the truth that 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.640
 I say good let's alternate a little bit 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.680
 the accessories to it seems that there are also 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.140
 challenges that have enough points for 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.029
 use and is looking good because we will 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 have a little bit of accessories and we're going to 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.199
 try the target finder that then 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.029
 you meet an uncle who has 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.449
 example the table the machine gun is 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.010
 fat and we go to the white finder and you 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.840
 you say but what do you do with that? 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.820
 has that I say good, well, I'm going to try it 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.070
 from there I put the unsheathed 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.230
 to aim fast since I say good if 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.489
 I've been in cashmere and that's it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.350
 it appears here that I carry a brick 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.790
 on top of the gun 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.040
 sure it points slowly so 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.940
 I say good defocused and so 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.060
 to point a lot and good kids are this 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.450
 and two was half past seven or so 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.250
 four minus twenty out there I guess 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.410
 yes I guess I know now while the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.760
 render just like you come out now and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.830
 I'm going to be telling serious uncle because 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.000
 about that video so late because 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.630
 you are fixed subscribers and we are on 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 984 985 subs and I say good because there will be 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.490
 make a special the shops and the truth 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.280
 that I am ready and I pulled and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.720
 all day and curing melo a lot of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.760
 a lot of time is living now 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.190
 same an image of sony vegas or 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.300
 all the things that you have to the tracks 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.520
 video all the audio pieces 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 when it is tv has few basically 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 texts and a lot of little things there like 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.820
 you see in the image the truth that threw me 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.520
 all day helping him even if it's not 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.119
 great thing because I'm not an expert in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.320
 this edit but well I also do not 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.150
 has been so bad so when 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.740
 we reach the 1000 its only sum 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.770
 charmed 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.560
 is saying someone who was wearing 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.630
 good what is saying and still not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.520
 had spoken that then took the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 death machine and then it is absorbed 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.130
 the chair to the rambo with the machine 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.110
 death code let's try the machine 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.729
 dead and the truth that is a whore 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.950
 fuck the death machine is a 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.269
 fuck you meet a guy in front 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.220
 With your rifle you will win with the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.420
 SMG and some times found me 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.860
 people with the death machine that I made 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.170
 it is but how it goes so much that it is there if not 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.989
 Well, I really do not know, I do not know 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.130
 I do not see anything about the death machine either 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.680
 for me the white one will be much better 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.680
 I do not want to touch what the guy is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 I was dying and I do not know, I'm not convinced 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.580
 this death machine 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.920
 other than that they look at the bullets or they have 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.110
 200 bullets that you fuse them before 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.840
 pay attention to what I have left 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 granada of the heavens god be who the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 he threw from his base but when the luck 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 is saying the aie seemed much better 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.430
 the tempering death machine of the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.569
 he really wants to touch him and the uncle was 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.640
 dead but is not scheming 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.130
 it shows no, it does not convince me 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.630
 besides that look, they're almost 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.720
 finishing spent bullets over 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.600
 half and here as it starts to shoot 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.190
 he has glued shots with the pw and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.710
 origin by payÃ¡ death machine shit 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.640
 and that I put it to test them and to 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.640
 rambo style 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.939
 and good since I've been doing 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:15.260
 special my subs I say logically 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.090
 I have put to play now I say come on let's go 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.439
 to take out a gameplay to explain what 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.359
 I've been doing all day and such and 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.170
 because I follow the video so late the truth 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:28.609
 that I do not know well taken out like that twenty-something 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.859
 3 things like this I say this is a 22 to 4 nothing 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.250
 of another world, far from it all 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.510
 days I will bring 81 3 not but good as 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.790
 I say they are not gameplay from another world but 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.099
 good for what's coming 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.739
 pretty pretty if I had played 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.959
 better I would have taken a weapon as if 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.159
 have to take us with the post 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.680
 whites for the best I would have pulled out 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.769
 a game where team dueling does not 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.549
 had time to do a lot of things had not 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.769
 one of the prestige level was of the level 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.750
 this one is uglier than the first levels 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.790
 also been with your friend's command 1 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.830
 and as I tell you if I had brought the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.350
 weapon so normal and is the truth that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360
 I got to take a game and everything 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.800
 although the game that I bring you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.150
 It's totally bad 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.560
 Well, well, I have to thank you 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.970
 I actively because you put a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.900
 comments that the truth motivates me jce 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.700
 butt or a few room comments 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.850
 ercilla mente cantata I love their 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.400
 videos I do not know what it is so the truth 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.500
 that you do not want us but you are motivated 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.810
 lots to follow and keep improving every 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.790
 day and good kids here the most 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.990
 shows the style of rambo you see that the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.340
 death machine has led to rambo era 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.190
 much better attention to this guy that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.770
 ago is a triple low with sml age 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.240
 until 23 22 4 as I said 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.460
 I hope you liked gameplay we are going to 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.540
 get fast to sleep subs and nothing we see 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.170
 in the next video goodbye 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.170
