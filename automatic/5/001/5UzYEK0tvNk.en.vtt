of Henry's creations see if you guys can
see<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.820> very<00:02:33.090> clearly<00:02:38.630> kinda<00:02:39.630> hard<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
see this very clearly kinda hard to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.260 
see this very clearly kinda hard to
differentiate<00:02:40.610> without<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> ton<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.300> light<00:02:44.270> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
differentiate without a ton of light so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.530 
differentiate without a ton of light so
that<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:46.820> light<00:02:47.820> toxic<00:02:48.570> green<00:02:50.180> regular<00:02:51.180> green

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that is light toxic green regular green

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.730 
that is light toxic green regular green
and<00:02:51.980> black<00:02:53.930> basically<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.960> made<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.350> black

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
and black basically I made it black

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.900 
and black basically I made it black
spacers<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:57.710> separate<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.860> two<00:02:59.010> greens<00:03:01.910> there

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
spacers to separate the two greens there

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.300 
spacers to separate the two greens there
you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.210> see<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.480> pretty<00:03:03.630> good<00:03:03.750> right<00:03:04.140> there<00:03:04.470> I

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.680 

thought<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.460> was<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> cool<00:03:08.910> cup<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.450> color

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
thought that was a cool cup of color

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.500 
thought that was a cool cup of color
combo<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.170> never<00:03:10.410> thought<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:11.070> one<00:03:14.510> so

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
combo I never thought about that one so

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.540 
combo I never thought about that one so

to show the flames cut your handles
shape<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.360> sides<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.050> don't<00:04:07.800> grind<00:04:08.220> on<00:04:08.459> this

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
shape the sides and don't grind on this

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.480 
shape the sides and don't grind on this
at<00:04:08.910> all<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.590> smooth<00:04:10.590> sand<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.130> little<00:04:11.370> bit

flames<00:04:13.410> off<00:04:13.680> really<00:04:14.040> good

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.610 

and<00:04:18.709> probably<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:20.069> think<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.819> coolest<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.620> he

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and probably I think the coolest one he

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.279 
and probably I think the coolest one he
came<00:04:22.860> up<00:04:23.039> with<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:24.889> digital<00:04:25.889> urban<00:04:26.400> camo<00:04:30.289> so

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
came up with was digital urban camo so

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.459 
came up with was digital urban camo so
you<00:04:32.189> can<00:04:32.340> see<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:33.020> couldn't<00:04:34.020> have<00:04:34.139> done<00:04:34.259> the

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:34.469 
you can see I couldn't have done the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.469 
you can see I couldn't have done the
whole<00:04:34.710> thing<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.939> really<00:04:36.060> wouldn't

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
whole thing in this it really wouldn't

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.629 
whole thing in this it really wouldn't
have<00:04:36.509> turned<00:04:37.349> out<00:04:37.530> well<00:04:37.770> plus<00:04:38.069> I<00:04:38.189> had<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.460> make

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
have turned out well plus I had to make

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.600 
have turned out well plus I had to make
this<00:04:38.819> myself<00:04:39.360> Assunta<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.860> can't<00:04:41.129> buy<00:04:41.280> paper

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
this myself Assunta you can't buy paper

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.529 
this myself Assunta you can't buy paper
like<00:04:41.969> that<00:04:42.409> so<00:04:43.409> that<00:04:43.620> would<00:04:43.770> be<00:04:43.949> not<00:04:44.310> very

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
like that so that would be not very

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.110 
like that so that would be not very
cost-effective<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:46.949> have<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:47.340> colors<00:04:47.789> of

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
cost-effective so we have the colors of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.129 
cost-effective so we have the colors of
the<00:04:48.569> urban<00:04:48.990> camo<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:49.500> there<00:04:49.909> you've<00:04:50.909> got<00:04:51.139> three

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
the urban camo in there you've got three

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.200 
the urban camo in there you've got three
shades<00:04:52.469> of<00:04:52.680> gray<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.659> black<00:04:54.659> and<00:04:55.409> it's<00:04:55.560> really

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
shades of gray and black and it's really

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:04.869 
shades of gray and black and it's really
hard<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:58.699> see<00:04:59.699> that<00:04:59.969> like<00:05:00.479> this<00:05:02.569> with<00:05:03.569> some

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
hard to see that like this with some

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.480 
hard to see that like this with some
further<00:05:06.289> carving<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.530> would<00:05:07.680> be<00:05:07.830> able<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.190> see

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
further carving you would be able to see

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.830 
further carving you would be able to see
