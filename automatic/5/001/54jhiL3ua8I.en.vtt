00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
couple designs first of all it's got to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
couple designs first of all it's got to
be<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> stable<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> seats<00:00:38.910> eight<00:00:39.260> maybe<00:00:40.260> ten

let me show you a first again I'll bring
this<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.119> closer<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
this in a little bit closer to the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.190 
this in a little bit closer to the
camera<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> table<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.170> ignore<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
camera this is the table and ignore the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
camera this is the table and ignore the
size<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> legs<00:01:14.159> those<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
size of the legs those are going to be

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.020 
size of the legs those are going to be
much<00:01:15.600> smaller<00:01:16.820> but<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.030> I've<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
much smaller but what I've got here is a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
much smaller but what I've got here is a
curved<00:01:21.030> Trussell<00:01:21.900> design<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.860> get

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
curved Trussell design we see don't get

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
curved Trussell design we see don't get
that<00:01:23.100> centered<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.580> camera<00:01:24.320> curved

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that centered in the camera curved

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.569 
that centered in the camera curved
Trussell<00:01:25.890> design<00:01:26.189> underneath<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:28.579> like

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
Trussell design underneath here I like

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
Trussell design underneath here I like
it<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:30.119> only<00:01:30.299> concern<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.810> after<00:01:31.350> putting<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it my only concern is after putting this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
it my only concern is after putting this
little<00:01:32.159> model<00:01:32.520> together<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
little model together was that if you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
little model together was that if you
get<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.220> three<00:01:36.030> people<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.509> each<00:01:36.689> side

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
get you know three people on each side

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.550 
get you know three people on each side
here<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> their<00:01:37.829> legs<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> hit

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
here is that their legs are going to hit

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
here is that their legs are going to hit
these<00:01:40.560> supports<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.509> nice<00:01:42.659> for

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
these supports it's going to be nice for

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
these supports it's going to be nice for
the<00:01:42.990> person<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> end<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.460> much

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the person on the end but not so much

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
the person on the end but not so much
for<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> people<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> sides<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.500> I've<00:01:46.590> got

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
for the people on the sides now I've got

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.300 
for the people on the sides now I've got
the<00:01:46.920> second<00:01:47.399> design<00:01:47.670> which<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the second design which I kind of like a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539 
the second design which I kind of like a
