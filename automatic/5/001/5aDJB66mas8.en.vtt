00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.139
 I have not the slightest 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.940
 have the city 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
 maybe a few days has the sewage 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.899
 after 4 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.899
 on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.240
 jel 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.489
 or use our anonymous access e-mail address 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.000
 of course easier 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.580
 they have it 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.390
 the singer of five years ago as himself 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 should escalate further 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.540
 would not it be better to have a high volatility for the decision 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.280
 Son was around him the mirror to suppress the steering system 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.060
 the Indian automaker Tata get 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 not with a 10 9-win bridging 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 it is very old 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.880
 there hangs 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.400
 then maybe she should get sick 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 but that's what she is for 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 I see no sign that this as a company with 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.300
 Euro 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.870
 where the duo came from 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.770
 I do not think that can be very realistic if you are already from 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.370
 table 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 after research 18 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.180
 hattingen / schwelm 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.249
 keep your eyes open is just a matter of time 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.360
 would you have done it for me for me 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.649
 I do not know how it was in Arizona 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.569
 it's about both sides wear his body 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.470
 These were not the way you tried to tell me 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.129
 what now I ask myself 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.060
 what you are there 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.060
 what else from their secrecy obligation 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.439
 that's how I got scanned for it
