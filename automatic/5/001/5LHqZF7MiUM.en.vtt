it<00:01:07.159> was<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.520> considered<00:01:08.299> an<00:01:08.450> experimental

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
it was just considered an experimental

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.800 
it was just considered an experimental
for<00:01:09.560> three<00:01:09.740> years<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.580> am<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:11.180> just<00:01:11.210> American

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
for three years the am is just American

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.870 
for three years the am is just American
motor<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.380> X<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:13.100> actually<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
motor so the X is actually the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.550 
motor so the X is actually the
designation<00:01:14.689> of<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.840> car<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.970> AMX<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> car

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560

that<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.799> saw<00:01:18.890> when<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:19.820> was<00:01:20.000> brand<00:01:20.390> new<00:01:20.659> when<00:01:21.140> I

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
that I saw when it was brand new when I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.560 
that I saw when it was brand new when I
was<00:01:21.350> 12<00:01:21.650> years<00:01:21.799> old<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:23.240> fell<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:23.540> love

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
was 12 years old and I just fell in love

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.139 
was 12 years old and I just fell in love
with<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.960> hood<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.950> way<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.250> car<00:01:25.460> looked<00:01:25.819> and

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
with the hood the way the car looked and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.349 
with the hood the way the car looked and
as<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:27.229> got<00:01:27.409> older<00:01:27.439> I<00:01:27.950> wanted<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.700> buy<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.149> but

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
as I got older I wanted to buy one but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.440 
as I got older I wanted to buy one but
1718<00:01:30.289> years<00:01:30.469> old<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:31.069> couldn't<00:01:31.759> find<00:01:32.030> any<00:01:32.270> of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
1718 years old I couldn't find any of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.389 
1718 years old I couldn't find any of
these<00:01:32.569> cars<00:01:32.929> that's<00:01:33.469> why<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.679> kind<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.039> got<00:01:34.219> into

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
these cars that's why I kind of got into

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.130 
these cars that's why I kind of got into
Mustangs<00:01:34.880> instead<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.689> know<00:01:35.780> because<00:01:36.020> they

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
Mustangs instead you know because they

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.340 
Mustangs instead you know because they
were<00:01:36.170> easier<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.619> find<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.429> took<00:01:37.850> me<00:01:38.090> over<00:01:38.780> four

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
were easier to find it took me over four

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.620 
were easier to find it took me over four
years<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:39.889> find<00:01:40.130> one<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.999> was<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.389> color

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
years to find one that was the color

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.410 
years to find one that was the color
that<00:01:41.929> I<00:01:41.960> wanted<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.770> was<00:01:43.069> Alamosa<00:01:43.670> aqua<00:01:44.210> which

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
that I wanted it was Alamosa aqua which

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.120 
that I wanted it was Alamosa aqua which
is<00:01:44.450> super<00:01:44.990> rare<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.469> happens<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.889> be<00:01:45.950> my

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
is super rare it happens to be my

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.190 
is super rare it happens to be my
favorite<00:01:46.520> color<00:01:46.549> there<00:01:47.299> were<00:01:47.389> only<00:01:47.569> special

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
favorite color there were only special

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.770 
favorite color there were only special
order<00:01:48.499> so<00:01:49.429> there<00:01:49.579> might<00:01:49.789> be<00:01:49.819> less<00:01:50.420> than<00:01:50.719> a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
order so there might be less than a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.999 
order so there might be less than a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
horsepower but it was usually higher

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.420

what it was intended it's not really
easy<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.180> restore<00:04:59.810> these<00:04:59.990> cars<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.919> was<00:05:01.100> very

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
easy to restore these cars it was very

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
easy to restore these cars it was very
difficult<00:05:01.669> to<00:05:01.940> find<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.510> was<00:05:02.600> clean

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
difficult to find and it was clean

16 years ago there weren't really any
reproduction<00:05:08.540> parts<00:05:08.780> for<00:05:09.200> it<00:05:09.230> you<00:05:09.950> know

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
reproduction parts for it you know

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.760 
reproduction parts for it you know
twenty<00:05:10.370> thousand<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.000> three<00:05:11.180> years<00:05:11.480> is

the other car that was manufactured
downtown<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.480> can<00:05:17.510> actually<00:05:17.900> build<00:05:18.170> a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
downtown you can actually build a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.500 
downtown you can actually build a
Mustang<00:05:18.680> from<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:18.980> ground<00:05:19.220> up<00:05:19.510> with

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
Mustang from the ground up with

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.350 
Mustang from the ground up with
reproduction<00:05:21.200> parts<00:05:21.410> but<00:05:21.920> these<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:23.270> know

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
reproduction parts but these you know

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.730 
reproduction parts but these you know
you<00:05:23.420> need<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.660> start<00:05:23.990> with<00:05:24.140> something<00:05:24.560> that's

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
you need to start with something that's
