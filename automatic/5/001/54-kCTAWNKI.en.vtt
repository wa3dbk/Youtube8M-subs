if you want to see the features let's go

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
if you want to see the features let's go
to<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> close-up<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.270> feature<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to the close-up and the first feature is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.490 
to the close-up and the first feature is
that<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.430> spiral<00:00:57.149> gear<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.840> which<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that there's a spiral gear here which is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.299 
that there's a spiral gear here which is
moving<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:58.949> gear<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:01.079> small<00:01:01.680> yard<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
moving this gear it's a small yard and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
moving this gear it's a small yard and
then<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> these<00:01:04.019> two<00:01:04.290> pieces<00:01:04.619> are

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
then when and these two pieces are

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
then when and these two pieces are
connected<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> hood<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
connected to the hood so when up and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
connected to the hood so when up and
this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.159> connected<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> giver<00:01:09.060> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this is connected to the giver so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.170 
this is connected to the giver so
whenever<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.869> wanted<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.369> hood<00:01:11.909> goes

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
whenever you wanted this the hood goes

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
whenever you wanted this the hood goes
up<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> wrote<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.680> way

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
up and when you wrote it the other way

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
up and when you wrote it the other way
it<00:01:14.280> goes<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it goes down the same thing with this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.910 
it goes down the same thing with this
the<00:01:17.400> tail<00:01:17.729> moves<00:01:18.180> when<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.540> were<00:01:18.890> when<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the tail moves when you were when you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
the tail moves when you were when you
are<00:01:20.869> crystal<00:01:21.869> clear<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> back<00:01:22.770> like

there to make a look bar like cooler and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.310 
there to make a look bar like cooler and
I<00:02:55.640> actually<00:02:56.060> changed<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.750> front<00:02:57.140> tires

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
use the bigger ones because I thought of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.770
