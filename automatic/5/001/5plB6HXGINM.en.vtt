or um you know if you drop it a lot or

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.790 
or um you know if you drop it a lot or
maybe<00:00:27.870> you<00:00:28.870> know<00:00:28.960> you<00:00:29.020> live<00:00:29.200> by<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.350> ocean<00:00:29.530> and

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
maybe you know you live by the ocean and

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.980 
maybe you know you live by the ocean and
you<00:00:29.860> just<00:00:30.010> constantly<00:00:30.520> drop<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.510> camera<00:00:31.780> into

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
you just constantly drop the camera into

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.660 
you just constantly drop the camera into
water<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.500> do<00:00:32.619> stuff<00:00:32.829> like<00:00:32.920> that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
water and do stuff like that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.730 
water and do stuff like that
it's<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.150> perfect<00:00:34.329> camera<00:00:34.690> for<00:00:34.930> that<00:00:34.960> because

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
it's the perfect camera for that because

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's the perfect camera for that because
it<00:00:35.950> is<00:00:36.160> fully<00:00:36.700> shockproof<00:00:37.150> and<00:00:37.540> waterproof

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
it is fully shockproof and waterproof

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.650 
it is fully shockproof and waterproof
it's<00:00:38.590> actually<00:00:38.890> waterproof<00:00:39.070> up<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.460> 16<00:00:40.239> feet

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
it's actually waterproof up to 16 feet

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.229 
it's actually waterproof up to 16 feet
which<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:40.870> really<00:00:41.290> pretty<00:00:41.980> deep<00:00:42.400> as<00:00:42.610> well<00:00:43.120> as

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
which is really pretty deep as well as

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.120 
which is really pretty deep as well as
it's<00:00:43.360> also<00:00:43.480> shock<00:00:43.810> absorbing<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.260> up<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.440> 6.6

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
it's also shock absorbing it's up to 6.6

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.790 
it's also shock absorbing it's up to 6.6
foot<00:00:45.670> drop<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.210> can<00:00:46.360> take<00:00:46.600> its<00:00:46.989> winterize<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
foot drop it can take its winterize and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.030 
foot drop it can take its winterize and
go-<00:00:48.130> 10<00:00:48.579> but<00:00:49.270> below<00:00:49.750> zero<00:00:50.020> Celsius<00:00:50.470> which<00:00:50.890> is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
go- 10 but below zero Celsius which is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.490 
go- 10 but below zero Celsius which is
really<00:00:51.460> really<00:00:51.550> cold<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.540> LED<00:00:52.989> can<00:00:53.170> absorb<00:00:53.410> up

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
really really cold the LED can absorb up

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.030 
really really cold the LED can absorb up
to<00:00:53.820> 220<00:00:54.820> pounds<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.329> impact<00:00:55.750> it's<00:00:56.170> absolutely

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
to 220 pounds of impact it's absolutely

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.430 
to 220 pounds of impact it's absolutely
incredible<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:58.239> got<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.390> 14<00:00:58.870> megapixel

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
incredible it's got a 14 megapixel

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.959 
incredible it's got a 14 megapixel
sensor<00:00:59.739> so<00:00:59.890> you<00:00:59.920> know<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.160> gonna<00:01:00.280> produce

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
sensor so you know it's gonna produce

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.690 
sensor so you know it's gonna produce
some<00:01:01.239> pretty<00:01:01.450> awesome<00:01:01.719> images<00:01:02.520> 5x<00:01:03.520> optical

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
some pretty awesome images 5x optical

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.450 
some pretty awesome images 5x optical
zoom<00:01:04.000> it's<00:01:04.269> actually<00:01:04.540> an<00:01:04.600> f3<00:01:04.989> point<00:01:05.229> 5<00:01:05.409> 2<00:01:05.619> F<00:01:05.740> 5.1

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
zoom it's actually an f3 point 5 2 F 5.1

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.090 
zoom it's actually an f3 point 5 2 F 5.1
it's<00:01:06.880> got<00:01:07.030> image<00:01:07.360> stabilization<00:01:07.720> in<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.890> lens

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
it's got image stabilization in the lens

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's got image stabilization in the lens
it<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.460> sensor<00:01:10.000> shift<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.360> it's<00:01:10.450> actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
it is a sensor shift so it's actually

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.510 
it is a sensor shift so it's actually
not<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.049> lens<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:11.680> actually<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.159> sensor

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
not the lens it's actually the sensor

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.890 
not the lens it's actually the sensor
but<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:12.729> kind<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.909> in-between<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.630> sensor

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
but it's kind of in-between the sensor

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.450 
but it's kind of in-between the sensor
will<00:01:14.049> actually<00:01:14.409> shift<00:01:14.620> up<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.040> down<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.400> if

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
will actually shift up and down so if

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.950 
will actually shift up and down so if
you're<00:01:15.520> shaking<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:15.940> camera<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.810> was

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
you're shaking the camera and that was

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.750 
you're shaking the camera and that was
gonna<00:01:17.080> produce<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.500> blurry<00:01:17.710> image<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.430> sensor

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
gonna produce a blurry image the sensor

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.950 
gonna produce a blurry image the sensor
is<00:01:18.820> gonna<00:01:18.970> shake<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.210> little<00:01:19.360> bit<00:01:19.479> too<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:19.840> that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
is gonna shake a little bit too so that

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.660 
is gonna shake a little bit too so that
it<00:01:20.049> matches<00:01:20.170> up<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.799> get<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.070> sharp<00:01:21.400> image

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
it matches up and you get a sharp image

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
it matches up and you get a sharp image
it's<00:01:22.510> got<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.990> very<00:01:23.409> very<00:01:23.619> nice<00:01:23.770> 2.7<00:01:24.549> inch
