00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
in which we were in and receive mobile
data<00:01:07.259> for<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.280> incur<00:01:08.549> high

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
data for which we would incur high

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
data for which we would incur high
charges<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.320> would<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> switch<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
charges so we would like to switch this

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.420 
charges so we would like to switch this
off<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.729> avoid<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:13.219> simply<00:01:15.049> press<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> icon

to return to your normal operation so
that<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.739> how<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.450> disable<00:02:38.950> data<00:02:39.950> for<00:02:40.880> roaming

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
that is how you disable data for roaming
