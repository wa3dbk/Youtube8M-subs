are actually starting to come out from
the<00:00:18.180> executives<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.810> Sony<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.310> would<00:00:20.460> seem

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the executives at Sony so it would seem

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.160 
the executives at Sony so it would seem
that<00:00:20.760> share<00:00:21.180> play<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.600> limited<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> maximum

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
that share play is limited to a maximum

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.040 
that share play is limited to a maximum
of<00:00:22.590> 16<00:00:23.100> minutes<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.519> any<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:23.939> session<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.930> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
of 16 minutes in any one session what we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
of 16 minutes in any one session what we
don't<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> whether<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.580> means<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
don't know is whether this means you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
don't know is whether this means you
will<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> fast<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.590> share<00:00:28.830> again

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
will then have to fast to share again

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
will then have to fast to share again
and<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.730> friend<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> accept<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and your friend will have to accept and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
and your friend will have to accept and
the<00:00:31.439> connection<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.759> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the connection will have to be we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.600 
the connection will have to be we
established<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.719> seems<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> case<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
established that seems to be the case so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
established that seems to be the case so
unfortunate<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> bad<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.690> us<00:00:36.840> for

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
unfortunate it's kind of bad on us for

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
unfortunate it's kind of bad on us for
having<00:00:37.620> assumed<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.460> Sony<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> do

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
having assumed that Sony was going to do

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
having assumed that Sony was going to do
something<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.620> awesome<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> not

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
something really awesome here and not

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.389 
something really awesome here and not
put<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> limit<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> why<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.340> think

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
put a limit on there so why do I think

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
put a limit on there so why do I think
Sony<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.180> done<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> reasons

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Sony have done this what are the reasons

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
Sony have done this what are the reasons
why<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> main<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
why well I think the main one is that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
why well I think the main one is that
they<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> upset<00:00:49.710> developers<00:00:50.550> too

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
they don't want to upset developers too

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
they don't want to upset developers too
much<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.090> essentially<00:00:51.480> giving<00:00:51.960> away<00:00:52.230> free

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
much by essentially giving away free

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
much by essentially giving away free
games<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.120> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.840> happen

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
games which is kind of what would happen

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
games which is kind of what would happen
if<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.410> wasn't<00:00:55.770> any<00:00:55.860> limit<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.520> there

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
if there wasn't any limit on that there

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
if there wasn't any limit on that there
wasn't<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.940> session<00:00:57.270> limit<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.140> sit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
wasn't a session limit you could sit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
wasn't a session limit you could sit
there<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.590> eight<00:00:58.649> hours<00:00:58.859> play<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> game

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
there for eight hours play the game

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
there for eight hours play the game
completely<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> never<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> pay<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
completely and never have to pay for it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.490 
completely and never have to pay for it
now<00:01:02.000> my<00:01:03.000> flip<00:01:03.300> side<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.080> my<00:01:04.170> friend

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
now my flip side on that is if my friend

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
now my flip side on that is if my friend
brings<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> disc<00:01:05.100> round<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.540> sit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
brings the disc round for me I can sit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
brings the disc round for me I can sit
there<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> play<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> game<00:01:07.530> until<00:01:07.979> I've

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
there and I can play the game until I've

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
there and I can play the game until I've
completed<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> developers<00:01:09.570> are

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
completed it and the developers are

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.410 
completed it and the developers are
never<00:01:09.810> getting<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> penny<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> me<00:01:10.680> anyway

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
never getting a penny out to me anyway

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.969 
never getting a penny out to me anyway
the<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:12.570> option<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.830> Sony

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the other option here is that Sony

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.820 
the other option here is that Sony
doesn't<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.000> effectively<00:01:15.930> remove<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
doesn't want to effectively remove the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
doesn't want to effectively remove the

grabbing the call of the games and then
just<00:01:42.450> being<00:01:42.630> shared<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.049> effectively

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
just being shared out effectively

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.889 
just being shared out effectively
through<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> streaming<00:01:44.280> service<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
through the streaming service and of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
through the streaming service and of
course<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> final<00:01:46.799> reason<00:01:47.070> Sony<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.729> doing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
course the final reason Sony are doing

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
course the final reason Sony are doing
this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.329> because<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:48.780> no<00:01:48.869> competition

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this is because there's no competition

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
this is because there's no competition
so<00:01:50.100> simple<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:50.970> put<00:01:51.090> whatever

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so simple as that they can put whatever

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
so simple as that they can put whatever
arbitrary<00:01:51.540> limit<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.560> it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
arbitrary limit on there they want it's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
arbitrary limit on there they want it's
not<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.369> Microsoft<00:01:53.850> has<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.119> answer<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
not like Microsoft has an answer that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
not like Microsoft has an answer that
would<00:01:54.990> say<00:01:55.200> mean<00:01:55.590> Microsoft<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.159> come<00:01:56.280> back

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
would say mean Microsoft and come back

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.039 
would say mean Microsoft and come back
and<00:01:56.549> say<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:57.180> gonna<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.689> hour<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and say we're gonna do an hour and a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
and say we're gonna do an hour and a
half<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.740> Sony<00:01:58.950> goes<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.549> they'll<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.820> two

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
half so Sony goes all they'll do two

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.240 
half so Sony goes all they'll do two
hours<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:00.869> 1<00:02:01.229> hour<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.530> 45<00:02:01.860> minutes

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
hours then or 1 hour and 45 minutes

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.219 
hours then or 1 hour and 45 minutes
essentially<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.880> no<00:02:03.030> competition<00:02:03.450> Sony<00:02:04.020> can

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
essentially with no competition Sony can

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.620 
essentially with no competition Sony can
say<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> 30<00:02:05.610> minutes<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.180> 60

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
say well it can be 30 minutes in 60

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.630 
say well it can be 30 minutes in 60
minutes<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.380> 35<00:02:07.799> seconds<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.459> feel<00:02:08.610> like

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
minutes to be 35 seconds if we feel like

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.419 
minutes to be 35 seconds if we feel like
it<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:09.810> any<00:02:09.929> calm

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
it it's not like there's any calm

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.509 
it it's not like there's any calm
in<00:02:10.670> there<00:02:10.909> to<00:02:11.299> kind<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.659> drive<00:02:12.230> us<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:13.040> make

in there to kind of drive us to make

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.250 
in there to kind of drive us to make
this<00:02:13.730> service<00:02:14.090> better<00:02:14.359> and<00:02:14.659> to<00:02:14.780> compete

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
this service better and to compete

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.369 
this service better and to compete
around<00:02:15.859> with<00:02:16.069> his<00:02:16.189> time<00:02:16.489> limit<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.260> do

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
around with his time limit so what do

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.630 
around with his time limit so what do
you<00:02:18.469> think<00:02:18.680> did<00:02:18.859> Sony<00:02:19.159> pull<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.459> wool<00:02:19.609> over

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you think did Sony pull the wool over

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.339 
you think did Sony pull the wool over
our<00:02:19.909> eyes<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.120> little<00:02:20.329> bit<00:02:20.629> or<00:02:20.780> were<00:02:21.200> they

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
our eyes a little bit or were they

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.619 
our eyes a little bit or were they
simply<00:02:21.650> keeping<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.519> negatives<00:02:23.030> away<00:02:23.390> from

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
simply keeping the negatives away from

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.929 
simply keeping the negatives away from
the<00:02:23.780> event<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.469> main<00:02:24.709> trench<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.310> mass

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
the event and the main trench of mass

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.670 
the event and the main trench of mass
journalism<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:26.900> going<00:02:27.139> on<00:02:27.230> at<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.379> time

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
journalism that was going on at the time

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.069 
journalism that was going on at the time
it<00:02:28.219> certainly<00:02:28.730> now<00:02:28.849> seems<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.209> Sony<00:02:29.870> has

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
it certainly now seems that Sony has

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.750 
it certainly now seems that Sony has
attempted<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:30.650> pull<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.829> bit<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.069> a<00:02:31.159> Microsoft

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
