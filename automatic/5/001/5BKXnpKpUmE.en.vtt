00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
still possible its have to get rid of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.680 
still possible its have to get rid of
them<00:04:46.260> before<00:04:46.440> they<00:04:46.680> end<00:04:46.860> up<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.250> position

them before they end up in that position
after<00:04:48.690> all<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.650> easier<00:04:50.010> matter<00:04:50.460> rivalry

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
after all it is easier matter rivalry

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
than it is to stop it however it is not
