00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.069

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.069
 Buy that I made I hope you like it 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.809
 well this is the seal of good 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.900
 says to be exempt 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 this is a purchase I made in exit 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.170
 to a girl who was 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.640
 I hope it's a mile I do not know 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:37.200
 This one was not selling and I thought 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 and they were calling at a very good price 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.590
 Y 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.590
 I had already seen 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.860
 others and others like other books equal 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.240
 let's get them out 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.240
 a hand is difficult 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.210
 is this book 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.680
 to make center figurines 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 do not 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.280
 in this other 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 also to do 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.520
 felt dessert 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.140
 I think these will be from her and the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.800
 and he wanted to put them up for sale 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.210
 and they cost me I think 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.260
 I do not remember well but I think they were 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.260
 and they came out at the end of the day 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.400
 150 each 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.400
 and I do not remember if 150 I think so 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.330
 and bring my little things 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 to do and here is explained 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.540
 how to do everything and I guess that around here 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.769
 become the patterns 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.769
 when I have a chance 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.080
 I will if here it is 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.570
 I'll try 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.840
 make them as they come out 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.840
 these are breads and cough 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.500
 and here they have also explained 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.460
 the material is in bourgeois 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.460
 of a pizza 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.380
