00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.889 

for<00:00:00.659> both<00:00:00.870> PEC<00:00:01.230> major<00:00:01.439> and<00:00:02.190> latissimus<00:00:02.760> dorsi

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
for both PEC major and latissimus dorsi

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.710 
for both PEC major and latissimus dorsi
so<00:00:03.899> we've<00:00:04.049> got<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> combined<00:00:04.620> test<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.190> do<00:00:05.370> that

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
so we've got a combined test to do that

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.450 
so we've got a combined test to do that
look<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.930> C<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.560> see<00:00:07.799> where<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> shortness

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
look at C and see where the shortness

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580 
look at C and see where the shortness
lies<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.910> those<00:00:09.059> particular<00:00:09.420> two<00:00:09.809> muscle

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
lies in those particular two muscle

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.740 
lies in those particular two muscle
groups<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.130> then<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.420> go<00:00:12.599> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
groups and then from there we can go on

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.600 
groups and then from there we can go on
and<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.049> some<00:00:13.259> PMF<00:00:13.650> techniques<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> try<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and do some PMF techniques to try and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.120 
and do some PMF techniques to try and
stretch<00:00:14.910> them<00:00:15.120> out<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.980> get

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
stretch them out so what we do is get

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.790 
stretch them out so what we do is get
your<00:00:17.220> client<00:00:17.520> lying<00:00:17.730> supine<00:00:18.240> position<00:00:18.990> arms

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
your client lying supine position arms

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
your client lying supine position arms
and<00:00:20.400> hands<00:00:21.029> down<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> side<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> body

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and hands down by the side of the body

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
and hands down by the side of the body
to<00:00:22.170> start<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.789> ask

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to start with and we're going to ask

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
to start with and we're going to ask
them<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> start<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.109> raising<00:00:25.800> their

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
them to start by just raising their

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
them to start by just raising their
hands<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:28.019> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
hands up like so so can you just do that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.470 
hands up like so so can you just do that
for<00:00:28.500> me<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.760> around<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> head<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
for me use down around the head of the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
for me use down around the head of the
couch<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.619> passively<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
couch and then just passively take the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630 
couch and then just passively take the
wrists<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.750> lower<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> position

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
wrists and lower them into that position

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.139 
wrists and lower them into that position
and<00:00:36.090> observe<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.850> there's<00:00:38.850> two

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and observe what is going on there's two

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.630 
and observe what is going on there's two
things<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:39.870> looking<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.680> one

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
things that we're looking for here one

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
things that we're looking for here one
how<00:00:42.059> much<00:00:42.270> space<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.079> between<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> arms

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
how much space there is between the arms

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
how much space there is between the arms
and<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> couch<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:45.899> indication

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and the couch and that's an indication

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.240 
and the couch and that's an indication
of<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:47.010> tight<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.840> PEC<00:00:48.840> major<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.410> okay

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of how tight or not PEC major is okay

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.939 
of how tight or not PEC major is okay
and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> second<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.289> wide<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and then the second is how wide the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.970 
and then the second is how wide the
elbows<00:00:53.340> come<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> elbows<00:00:55.379> come<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.770> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
elbows come so if the elbows come out in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.369 
elbows come so if the elbows come out in
that<00:00:56.190> fashion<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.750> indication<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that fashion that's an indication that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.590 
that fashion that's an indication that
the<00:00:58.500> stiffness<00:00:58.859> door<00:00:59.340> side<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.910> short<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.390> well

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the stiffness door side is short as well

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.670 
the stiffness door side is short as well
okay<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> instance<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
okay so in this instance you can see and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
okay so in this instance you can see and
make<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:05.040> own<00:01:05.070> conclusions<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.119> certainly

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
make your own conclusions here certainly

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
make your own conclusions here certainly
no<00:01:07.020> shortness<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.710> latissimus<00:01:08.250> dorsi<00:01:08.630> tiny

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
no shortness in latissimus dorsi tiny

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.760 
no shortness in latissimus dorsi tiny
bit<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> PEC<00:01:10.290> major

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
bit in PEC major

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.149 
bit in PEC major
okay<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.240> lats<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.320> responsible

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
okay so lats as we know do responsible

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
okay so lats as we know do responsible
for<00:01:14.310> adduction<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> lat<00:01:15.270> pulldown

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
for adduction in a lat pulldown

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
for adduction in a lat pulldown
they<00:01:16.470> insert<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> front<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
they insert around the front of the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
they insert around the front of the
humerus<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> therefore<00:01:19.320> responsible<00:01:20.100> for

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
humerus and therefore responsible for

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
humerus and therefore responsible for
internal<00:01:20.880> rotation<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.259> internal

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
internal rotation and it's that internal

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
internal rotation and it's that internal
rotation<00:01:23.280> tightness<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.210> pulls<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> elbows

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
rotation tightness that pulls the elbows

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
rotation tightness that pulls the elbows
out<00:01:25.490> okay<00:01:26.990> we've<00:01:27.990> gotta<00:01:28.170> clear<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.729> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
out okay we've gotta clear on that so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
out okay we've gotta clear on that so
protect<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> arms<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.070> start<00:01:32.070> with

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
protect the arms back and start with

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.319 
protect the arms back and start with
first<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.090> PEC<00:01:33.420> major<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> best<00:01:35.909> action

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
first of all PEC major the best action

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.429 
first of all PEC major the best action
to<00:01:36.900> stretch<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.829> horizontal<00:01:38.189> abduction

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
to stretch that is horizontal abduction

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
to stretch that is horizontal abduction
so<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.490> sure<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> don't<00:01:42.060> put

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so to do that to make sure I don't put

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
so to do that to make sure I don't put
any<00:01:42.360> pressure<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.350> anterior<00:01:43.710> capsule<00:01:44.159> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
any pressure on the anterior capsule I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
any pressure on the anterior capsule I
need<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> shoulder<00:01:46.020> over<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.680> side

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
need to get the shoulder over this side

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
need to get the shoulder over this side
of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.159> couch<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:48.270> make<00:01:48.479> sure<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> stay

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of the couch to make sure you stay

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
of the couch to make sure you stay
stable<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> couch<00:01:50.009> we'll<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
stable on the couch we'll have them at a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
stable on the couch we'll have them at a
diagonal<00:01:51.119> angle<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.930> complete<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.619> over

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
diagonal angle so complete think over

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
diagonal angle so complete think over
their<00:01:53.030> shoulder<00:01:54.030> over<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.360> side<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
their shoulder over this side that's it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.580 
their shoulder over this side that's it
it's<00:01:55.590> great<00:01:56.659> then<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.899> I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.350> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's great then what I'm going to do is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.069 
it's great then what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> arm<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.570> as<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.659> say<00:02:00.869> into

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
take the arm out as I say into

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
take the arm out as I say into
horizontal<00:02:01.530> abduction<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.670> I've<00:02:02.820> got<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
horizontal abduction and I've got to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
horizontal abduction and I've got to
judge<00:02:03.560> exactly<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.740> angle<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
judge exactly what angle is going to be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.859 
judge exactly what angle is going to be
best<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.420> target<00:02:06.899> most<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> fibers<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.910> we

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
best to target most of the fibers now we

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
best to target most of the fibers now we
should<00:02:10.080> recognize<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> origins<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
should recognize where the origins of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280 
should recognize where the origins of
PEC<00:02:12.150> major<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.690> around

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
PEC major are around

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.070 
PEC major are around
and<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.860> clavicle<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.209> you've<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.480> fibers

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and the clavicle so you've got fibers

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.229 
and the clavicle so you've got fibers
coming<00:02:16.349> out<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.010> inserting<00:02:17.909> on<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
coming out and inserting on the

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.440 
coming out and inserting on the
bicipital<00:02:18.629> groove<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.560> humerus<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:21.060> we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
bicipital groove on the humerus if we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.080 
bicipital groove on the humerus if we
adjust<00:02:22.409> that<00:02:22.620> angle<00:02:23.099> at<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.310> moment<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.909> go

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
adjust that angle at the moment if I go

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.780 
adjust that angle at the moment if I go
for<00:02:24.269> an<00:02:24.329> absolute<00:02:24.810> horizontal<00:02:25.560> angle<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.579> can

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
for an absolute horizontal angle you can

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.759 
for an absolute horizontal angle you can
see<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.150> line<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> pull<00:02:27.840> through<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> humerus

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
see the line of pull through the humerus

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.949 
see the line of pull through the humerus
is<00:02:29.189> directly<00:02:29.760> onto<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> clavicle<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.870> not

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
is directly onto the clavicle so I'm not

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.350 
is directly onto the clavicle so I'm not
going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> get<00:02:31.290> much<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.739> stretch<00:02:32.040> there<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to get much of a stretch there the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.500 
going to get much of a stretch there the
more<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.599> move<00:02:33.989> up<00:02:34.200> into<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.129> position<00:02:35.510> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
more I move up into that position and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.110 
more I move up into that position and
then<00:02:36.810> take<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.290> arm<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.489> more<00:02:38.730> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
then take the arm down the more you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.740 
then take the arm down the more you
should<00:02:39.359> feel<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.659> stretch<00:02:39.780> yeah<00:02:40.739> across<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
should feel a stretch yeah across a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.179 
should feel a stretch yeah across a
broader<00:02:42.750> sort<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.200> spread<00:02:43.530> within<00:02:44.040> that

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
broader sort of spread within that

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.849 
broader sort of spread within that
muscle<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.720> negotiate<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.590> with

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
muscle now you can negotiate that with

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.860 
muscle now you can negotiate that with
your<00:02:47.040> client<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.879> by<00:02:48.030> them<00:02:48.269> feeling<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
your client but just by them feeling it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.160 
your client but just by them feeling it
so<00:02:49.079> just<00:02:49.349> move<00:02:49.650> around<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.190> few<00:02:50.370> degrees<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.209> go

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
so just move around a few degrees and go

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
so just move around a few degrees and go
into<00:02:52.319> horizontal<00:02:52.650> abduction<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:54.090> actually

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
into horizontal abduction and actually

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.449 
into horizontal abduction and actually
find<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.139> best<00:02:55.409> position<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:56.129> get<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
find the best position to get that

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.180 
find the best position to get that
stretch<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:58.290> next<00:02:58.560> thing<00:02:58.709> we've<00:02:58.829> got<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.099> do

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
stretch the next thing we've got to do

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.610 
stretch the next thing we've got to do
is<00:02:59.340> establish<00:02:59.599> position<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.079> sure<00:03:01.409> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
is establish position to make sure that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.649 
is establish position to make sure that
origins<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.250> insertions<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:03.090> move<00:03:03.329> further

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
origins and insertions do move further

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.220 
origins and insertions do move further
apart<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.230> stretch<00:03:04.530> phase<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.569> if<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.840> lower

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
apart and stretch phase and if I lower

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.440 
apart and stretch phase and if I lower
the<00:03:07.440> arm<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.010> he's<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> start

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the arm like so he's going to start

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.599 
the arm like so he's going to start
rolling<00:03:09.690> towards<00:03:10.290> me<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.129> what<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.579> to

can stop him rolling towards me
it<00:03:25.560> also<00:03:25.739> helped<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:26.519> I'm<00:03:26.760> dealing<00:03:27.199> or<00:03:28.199> working

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it also helped if I'm dealing or working

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.409 
it also helped if I'm dealing or working
with<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.799> female<00:03:29.160> client<00:03:29.459> obviously<00:03:29.940> that's

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
with a female client obviously that's

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.629 
with a female client obviously that's
not<00:03:30.599> going<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.750> be<00:03:30.840> too<00:03:31.109> obtrusive<00:03:31.379> if<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.430> put

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
not going to be too obtrusive if I put

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.400 
not going to be too obtrusive if I put
my<00:03:32.790> hand<00:03:33.090> over<00:03:33.389> hers<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.019> middle<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
my hand over hers in the middle of the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.530 
my hand over hers in the middle of the
chest<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.129> okay<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:37.650> hand<00:03:38.090> moves<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.480> to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
chest like so okay this hand moves on to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.449 
chest like so okay this hand moves on to
the<00:03:39.870> biceps<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:41.010> moment<00:03:41.340> he's

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
the biceps because in a moment he's

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.280 
the biceps because in a moment he's
going<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.669> push<00:03:41.879> up<00:03:42.120> towards<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.690> ceiling<00:03:42.959> so

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
going to push up towards the ceiling so

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.979 
going to push up towards the ceiling so
his<00:03:44.069> hand<00:03:44.340> doesn't<00:03:44.639> just<00:03:45.180> flop<00:03:45.419> around<00:03:45.629> he

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
his hand doesn't just flop around he

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.210 
his hand doesn't just flop around he
doesn't<00:03:46.109> know<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.739> with<00:03:46.919> it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
doesn't know what to do with it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.860

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
to go on to latissimus dorsi for that

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.520 
to go on to latissimus dorsi for that
we're<00:05:11.390> going<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.540> turn<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.930> client<00:05:12.260> on<00:05:12.410> the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
we're going to turn the client on the

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.800 
we're going to turn the client on the
side<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.190> if<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.669> turn<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.540> side

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.640 
that that's it so we don't want too much
side<00:05:26.479> flexion<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.050> head<00:05:27.290> make<00:05:27.620> sure

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
side flexion of the head make sure

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.040 
side flexion of the head make sure
they're<00:05:27.979> nice<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.130> comfortable<00:05:28.930> stable<00:05:29.930> in

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
they're nice and comfortable stable in

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.450 
they're nice and comfortable stable in
the<00:05:30.140> leg<00:05:30.320> region<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:30.890> he's<00:05:31.010> got<00:05:31.130> his<00:05:31.220> knees

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
the leg region so he's got his knees

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.580 
the leg region so he's got his knees
slightly<00:05:31.790> bent<00:05:31.970> here<00:05:32.419> so<00:05:32.690> that's<00:05:32.870> okay<00:05:33.350> and

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
slightly bent here so that's okay and

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.090 
slightly bent here so that's okay and
the<00:05:34.250> torso<00:05:34.580> should<00:05:35.090> be<00:05:35.380> fairly<00:05:36.380> vertical<00:05:36.950> in

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
the torso should be fairly vertical in

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.450 
the torso should be fairly vertical in
that<00:05:37.610> plane<00:05:37.880> okay<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:39.289> stretch<00:05:39.650> position<00:05:39.919> is

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
that plane okay the stretch position is

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.670 
that plane okay the stretch position is
for<00:05:40.910> them<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.120> take<00:05:41.510> their<00:05:41.690> arm<00:05:41.930> over<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:42.560> top

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
for them to take their arm over the top

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.750 
for them to take their arm over the top
like<00:05:43.190> so

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
like so

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.590 
like so
and<00:05:43.850> just<00:05:44.810> lower<00:05:45.200> into<00:05:45.740> that<00:05:45.890> position<00:05:46.600> we've

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
and just lower into that position we've

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.760 
and just lower into that position we've
then<00:05:47.810> got<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:48.110> control<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.560> stretch<00:05:49.039> and<00:05:49.370> this

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
then got to control the stretch and this

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.740 
then got to control the stretch and this
position<00:05:51.770> will<00:05:51.950> depend<00:05:52.400> on<00:05:52.700> your<00:05:53.270> relative

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
position will depend on your relative

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.320 
position will depend on your relative
size<00:05:54.020> as<00:05:54.320> a<00:05:54.350> practitioner<00:05:54.850> in<00:05:55.850> relation<00:05:56.300> to
