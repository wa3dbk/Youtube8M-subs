illustration<00:01:07.490> markers<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:08.690> these<00:01:09.530> are<00:01:09.590> very

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
illustration markers it's these are very

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
illustration markers it's these are very
comparable<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:11.200> those<00:01:12.200> markers<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.430> marks

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
comparable to those markers the marks

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.390 
comparable to those markers the marks
that<00:01:14.000> they<00:01:14.210> make<00:01:14.480> they're<00:01:15.080> blendability<00:01:15.860> but

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
that they make they're blendability but

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.280 
that they make they're blendability but
the<00:01:16.520> biggest<00:01:16.820> benefit<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.540> instead<00:01:18.230> of

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
the biggest benefit is that instead of

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.830 
the biggest benefit is that instead of
using<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.740> blender<00:01:19.130> pen<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.300> always<00:01:20.540> just

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
using a blender pen you can always just

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.260 
using a blender pen you can always just
use<00:01:20.960> water<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.800> blend<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> Windsor

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
use water to blend it so the Windsor

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.360 
use water to blend it so the Windsor
Newton<00:01:23.420> watercolor<00:01:24.260> sticks<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:25.100> sort<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
Newton watercolor sticks they sort of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.910 
Newton watercolor sticks they sort of
remind<00:01:25.580> me<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.270> hybrid<00:01:26.510> between<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:27.500> water

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
remind me of a hybrid between a water

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.399 
remind me of a hybrid between a water
soluble<00:01:28.360> crayon<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.800> pan<00:01:31.159> sets<00:01:32.000> of

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
soluble crayon and like the pan sets of

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.710 
soluble crayon and like the pan sets of
watercolors<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.400> either<00:01:34.550> like<00:01:35.180> wet

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
watercolors so you can either like wet

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.990 
watercolors so you can either like wet
your<00:01:35.900> brush<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.710> take<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.430> straight<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.760> the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
your brush and take it straight to the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.750 
your brush and take it straight to the
stick<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.479> just<00:01:38.630> think<00:01:39.020> from<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.470> or<00:01:39.770> you

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
stick and just think from that or you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.930 
stick and just think from that or you
can<00:01:41.000> take<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.020> directly<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.680> paper<00:01:42.940> draw

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
can take it directly to the paper draw

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.910 
can take it directly to the paper draw
whatever<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.420> want<00:01:44.690> on<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.170> paper<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.710> then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
whatever you want on the paper and then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.969 
whatever you want on the paper and then
re<00:01:46.549> wet<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.970> with<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.270> brush<00:01:47.540> or<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:48.650> could<00:01:48.830> wet

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
re wet it with a brush or you could wet

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.010 
re wet it with a brush or you could wet
your<00:01:49.159> paper<00:01:49.370> first<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.150> then<00:01:50.240> draw<00:01:50.600> with<00:01:50.840> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
your paper first and then draw with it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.610 
your paper first and then draw with it
you

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.130 
you
got<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> similar<00:01:52.040> effect<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:53.510> with<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.870> pool

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
