00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 and welcome to franzi bakes 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.219
 and I want to cook again today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 cook it and do it with this super 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.470
 delicious fruits that are not put 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 and I would then zwetschge today 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 Jam with the man behind 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.350
 also button can or just like that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.429
 can smear on bread the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.349
 most important in the simple of murders 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.210
 of course the fruits and the must 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 Firstly, afford nicely but also 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.160
 do not be over rich so do not allow 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 be finished 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 important is we have to get out of it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 you can make one once here 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.879
 and as you can see if it's really good 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.300
 then they are great to solve 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.460
 By the way, just on the plums are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 organic plums were not 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.370
 injected 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.180
 therefore you can use them completely 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.180
 with a bowl 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 I make a jam with the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.470
 thermomix that's a mixa too 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.170
 may need 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.120
 and also weigh and there I have now 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.910
 here again function employed 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.760
 and give me a bed around that 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.190
 should now be 700 grams it comes 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.320
 also there 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.200
 and now I will the first one 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.550
 Let's celebrate a little bit here now 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.560
 can be the smaller if plum 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.210
 you could do all this in the pot now 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.050
 Of course there with a blender already 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.580
 successor 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:50.619
 now come the Südzucker of it 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.619
 we need 350 km 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.420
 this could be a bit more 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.130
 go for lemon juice or citric acid 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.900
 to the point of everyone 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 have asked what it actually cinnamon 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.030
 will be out of these cinnamon sticks here 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 grated 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.230
 since I have a little bit more now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.520
 nation the whole is supposed to be the thermomix 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.020
 now again briefly stir 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.540
 now all this is beautifully mingled 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.650
 and from that the thermomix can now 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.720
 Cook Marmelade 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.510
 I think the thermomix needs it 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.700
 about 15 minutes at 100 degrees 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.370
 important is that the Südzucker 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.950
 cook at least four minutes 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.239
 to study properly 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.800
 if you do it on the wall you have to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.720
 of course stir again and again 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.209
 she does not burn you to load 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 while the jam is cooking you can 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.530
 maybe hear that in the background 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.420
 I prepare the glasses before we get there 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.070
 to introduce the hot jam 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.520
 I have a kettle in the kettle 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.360
 water is boiling and the water i feel 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.360
 now in the glasses 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.580
 I would like to prevent that from happening 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.070
 glasses afterwards while filling the hot ones 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.590
 jam burst and everything should 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.170
 of course nice and clean and sterile 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.180
 the thermomix is ​​now finished with 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 jam and I cook one more 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.290
 lesson to watch 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.290
 on the areal is already test correctly 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.580
 from it and to the here on a shell 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:36.630
 or on the plate and wait around plaster 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.290
 easy to determine if sitting is yes 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.660
 that cool saying off then I can 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.060
 the whole thing now with her mix again 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.310
 for her now that the jam 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.710
 cured and I can the hot ones 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.930
 pour jam into the glasses beforehand 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.760
 Of course, the hot water must come out of me 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.260
 have a bowl of hot water here 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.960
 I can go there later 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.580
 use flower casting to touch the 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.050
 I use a kitchen 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:10.750
 glove because we are already 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:14.410
 pretty circle pouring out a glass 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.410
 and individually 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:33.520
 nice full and the lid on it go 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.390
 he has to sit really well and tight 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.710
 so that there is no dirt there 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.350
 that will be durable too 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.730
 then turn the blowers upside down 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.370
 that 's it for today again 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.710
 our jam is ready i got here 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.540
 I still have that for this jam 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.030
 I made a little pretty 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.430
 tinkered labels have all that 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.480
 just there for the rare sticker 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.710

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.890

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.510
 fabric girl got he has leftovers 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.340
 you can just cut out a lot of vinegar 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.830
 and then with a little wall 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.320
