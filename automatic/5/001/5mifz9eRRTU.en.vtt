00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
options at this point

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
beginning that affected the quarters

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
beginning that affected the quarters
sales<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.110> profitability<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:26.070> missed<00:01:26.280> our

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
sales and in profitability we missed our

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
sales and in profitability we missed our
number<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.150> strong<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.630> forward

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
number but we're strong going forward

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.130 
number but we're strong going forward
now<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.570> they<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> fight

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
now they can do that or they can fight

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
now they can do that or they can fight
tooth<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> nail<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.729> sure<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.150> hit

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
tooth and nail to make sure they hit

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
tooth and nail to make sure they hit
their<00:01:33.540> numbers<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.290> think<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.680> what

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
their numbers and I think that's what

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.200 
their numbers and I think that's what
they're<00:01:34.950> doing<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
they're doing here I don't think it's a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
they're doing here I don't think it's a
coincidence<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:38.159> last<00:01:38.400> month

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
coincidence that in the very last month

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
coincidence that in the very last month
of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.030> quarter<00:01:39.390> you've<00:01:39.990> seen<00:01:40.350> these

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
aggressive promotions okay because what

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
aggressive promotions okay because what
they're<00:01:44.189> doing<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.640> pulling<00:01:45.030> sales

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
they're doing is they're pulling sales

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
they're doing is they're pulling sales
into<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> current<00:01:46.140> quarter<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.250> expense
