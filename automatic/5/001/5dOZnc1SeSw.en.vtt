00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
fast-moving fun space the sliding rack

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.950 
fast-moving fun space the sliding rack
allows<00:00:59.350> us<00:00:59.410> to<00:01:00.030> truly<00:01:01.030> change<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.540> look<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
allows us to truly change the look and

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.990 
allows us to truly change the look and
feel<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.170> studio<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.920> then<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.700> see<00:01:03.880> the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
feel the studio and then you see the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.609 
feel the studio and then you see the
jitter<00:01:04.210> cam<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.900> hangs<00:01:05.140> from<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.530> ceiling

jitter cam that hangs from the ceiling

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.410 
jitter cam that hangs from the ceiling
that<00:01:05.979> allows<00:01:06.250> us<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.700> completely<00:01:07.210> different

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
that allows us a completely different

in between you have this array of

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.040 
in between you have this array of
screens<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.880> carry<00:01:16.270> some<00:01:16.570> really<00:01:16.870> beautiful
