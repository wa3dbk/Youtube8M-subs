your death thing in that situation too

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
your death thing in that situation too
basically<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.410> we<00:01:31.560> were<00:01:31.650> thinking

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
basically what when we were thinking

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890 
basically what when we were thinking
about<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.220> death<00:01:32.430> themes<00:01:32.730> and<00:01:33.060> implementing

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
about the death themes and implementing

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.110 
about the death themes and implementing
that<00:01:33.990> feature<00:01:34.430> we<00:01:35.430> realized<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:35.850> they

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
that feature we realized that they

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.700 
that feature we realized that they
needed<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.480> do<00:01:36.600> had<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> lot<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.410> potential

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
needed to do had a lot more potential

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
needed to do had a lot more potential
than<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.640> explore<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.120> ways

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
than that you know to explore the ways

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
than that you know to explore the ways
that<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:39.540> could<00:01:39.720> let<00:01:40.130> talented<00:01:41.130> musicians

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that you could let talented musicians

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.000 
that you could let talented musicians
express<00:01:42.030> themselves<00:01:42.360> even<00:01:42.600> further<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.320> we've

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
express themselves even further so we've

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.040 
express themselves even further so we've
let<00:01:44.220> people<00:01:44.610> create<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.120> whole<00:01:45.330> full-length

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050
