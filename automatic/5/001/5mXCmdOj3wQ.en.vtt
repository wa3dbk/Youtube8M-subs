five different countries but first let's

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
five different countries but first let's
talk<00:00:59.609> about<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.059> pure<00:01:00.270> principles<00:01:00.480> behind<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
talk about the pure principles behind it

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
talk about the pure principles behind it
again<00:01:02.100> since<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:02.760> background<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> electrical

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
again since my background is electrical

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
again since my background is electrical
engineering<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> psychophysiology<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
engineering and psychophysiology and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.719 
engineering and psychophysiology and
measuring<00:01:07.020> life<00:01:07.229> electrically<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.520> come

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
measuring life electrically we have come

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
measuring life electrically we have come
to<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.030> significant<00:01:09.750> insights<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.619> what

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to some significant insights about what

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000 
to some significant insights about what
it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:12.210> empower<00:01:12.659> architecture<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it is that could empower architecture to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.149 
it is that could empower architecture to
really<00:01:14.340> serve<00:01:14.610> biology<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.409> begins<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
really serve biology and it begins with

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.280 
really serve biology and it begins with
a<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.549> simple<00:01:17.970> idea<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:20.400> idea<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
a very simple idea and that idea is that

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.310 
a very simple idea and that idea is that
everything<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.770> wishes<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.939> alive<00:01:24.330> needs

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
everything that wishes to be alive needs

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.340 
everything that wishes to be alive needs
to<00:01:25.619> store<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.640> information<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> life

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to store the information that is life

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
to store the information that is life
electrically<00:01:29.390> effectively<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
electrically effectively it's just a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
electrically effectively it's just a
model<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> say<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.060> been<00:01:33.210> talking

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
essentially doing is suppose you're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.310 
essentially doing is suppose you're

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the moment it first germinates what

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.610 
the moment it first germinates what
would<00:02:31.860> actually<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.640> seed<00:02:33.060> alive<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.870> if

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
would actually make the seed alive is if

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 
would actually make the seed alive is if

so<00:03:11.790> life<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.570> death<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:14.370> electric<00:03:15.060> field

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
so life or death is that electric field

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.039 
so life or death is that electric field
is<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.440> complicated<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:18.480> not<00:03:18.510> Airy<00:03:18.840> it's

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
is that complicated it's not Airy it's

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.190 
is that complicated it's not Airy it's
not<00:03:19.230> difficult<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.510> where<00:03:21.510> did<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.780> electric

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
not difficult so where did that electric

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.530 
not difficult so where did that electric
field<00:03:22.350> yep<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> scene<00:03:23.430> how<00:03:23.790> did<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.209> seed

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
field yep in the scene how did that seed

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.530 
field yep in the scene how did that seed
get<00:03:25.170> an<00:03:25.440> electric<00:03:26.070> field<00:03:26.310> strong<00:03:26.790> enough<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
get an electric field strong enough to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.970 
get an electric field strong enough to
change<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.019> angle<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.470> coming<00:03:28.769> water

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
change the angle of a coming water

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.509 
change the angle of a coming water
molecule<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.870> drama<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.380> if<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:32.130> look<00:03:32.250> at<00:03:32.370> some

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
field compressed so it can radiate and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.770 
field compressed so it can radiate and
that<00:04:15.979> electric<00:04:16.979> field<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:18.000> secret<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
that electric field is the secret of

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.159 
that electric field is the secret of
life

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
life

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.170 
life
now<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.280> has<00:04:20.519> implications<00:04:21.120> for

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
now that has implications for

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.239 
now that has implications for
architecture<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:23.009> mentioned

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:23.249 
architecture so you just mentioned

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:25.790 
architecture so you just mentioned
something<00:04:23.719> compression<00:04:24.719> and<00:04:25.199> specifically

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
something compression and specifically

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.769 
something compression and specifically
charge<00:04:26.159> compression<00:04:26.550> maybe<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.419> could<00:04:27.599> talk

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:27.779 
charge compression maybe you could talk

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.420 
charge compression maybe you could talk
a<00:04:27.810> little<00:04:28.050> bit<00:04:28.229> about<00:04:28.259> what<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.340> then

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
a little bit about what that is and then

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.059 
a little bit about what that is and then
how<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.580> plays<00:04:30.029> into<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.710> way<00:04:31.860> that

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
how that plays into the way that

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.219 
how that plays into the way that
architecture<00:04:32.759> is<00:04:33.029> structured<00:04:33.509> so<00:04:33.689> that<00:04:34.139> it

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
architecture is structured so that it

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.920 
architecture is structured so that it
could<00:04:34.349> effectively<00:04:34.800> compress<00:04:35.340> chart<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:36.659> is

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
could effectively compress chart that is

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.989 
could effectively compress chart that is
the<00:04:36.960> right<00:04:37.110> question<00:04:37.800> thank<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:38.189> absolutely

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:38.999 
the right question thank you absolutely

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.089 
the right question thank you absolutely
so<00:04:39.270> we're<00:04:39.689> talking<00:04:40.169> about<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.620> fact<00:04:40.889> that

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
so we're talking about the fact that

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.149 
so we're talking about the fact that
everything<00:04:41.909> that<00:04:42.749> you<00:04:43.020> consider<00:04:43.499> the<00:04:43.770> memory

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
everything that you consider the memory

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.809 
everything that you consider the memory
of<00:04:44.219> who<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.699> you<00:04:44.999> is<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.259> fact<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:47.340> shape<00:04:47.639> of

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
of who is you is in fact the shape of

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.999 
of who is you is in fact the shape of
electric<00:04:48.449> fields<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.199> compressed<00:04:49.710> in

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
electric fields that have compressed in

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.429 
electric fields that have compressed in
your<00:04:50.400> body<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:50.879> your<00:04:50.909> cells<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.719> your<00:04:51.810> DNA<00:04:52.259> in

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
your body in your cells in your DNA in

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.040 
your body in your cells in your DNA in
your<00:04:52.590> blood<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.210> ability<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.599> have<00:04:54.779> life

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
your blood so the ability to have life

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.189 
your blood so the ability to have life
and<00:04:55.409> survival<00:04:56.189> and<00:04:56.610> memory<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.659> even<00:04:57.960> maybe

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
and survival and memory and even maybe

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.129 
and survival and memory and even maybe
memory<00:04:58.710> after<00:04:59.069> death<00:04:59.360> depends<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.509> whether

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
memory after death depends on whether

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.339 
memory after death depends on whether
electric<00:05:01.680> fields<00:05:02.250> are<00:05:02.400> compressed

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
electric fields are compressed

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.320 
electric fields are compressed
efficiently<00:05:04.349> inside<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:05.219> inside<00:05:05.969> your<00:05:06.120> blood

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
efficiently inside you inside your blood

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.110 
efficiently inside you inside your blood
inside<00:05:06.689> your<00:05:06.870> DNA<00:05:07.050> inside<00:05:07.620> your<00:05:07.800> cells<00:05:08.039> so<00:05:08.340> the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
inside your DNA inside your cells so the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.820 
inside your DNA inside your cells so the
trick<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.680> compression<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:12.330> if<00:05:13.139> we<00:05:13.289> look<00:05:13.560> at

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
trick is compression and if we look at

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.219 
trick is compression and if we look at
the<00:05:14.520> history<00:05:14.819> of<00:05:14.909> computing<00:05:15.449> what's<00:05:15.810> that

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
the history of computing what's that

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.309 
the history of computing what's that
computers<00:05:16.889> are<00:05:17.129> the<00:05:17.189> discovery<00:05:17.819> of

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
computers are the discovery of

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.129 
computers are the discovery of
non-destructive<00:05:19.430> compression<00:05:20.749> if<00:05:21.749> we<00:05:21.990> look

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
non-destructive compression if we look

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.350 
non-destructive compression if we look
at<00:05:22.259> isodyne<00:05:22.620> he<00:05:23.009> said<00:05:23.250> what<00:05:23.610> is<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.879> secret<00:05:24.180> of

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
at isodyne he said what is the secret of

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.050 
at isodyne he said what is the secret of
the<00:05:24.419> unified<00:05:24.839> field<00:05:24.919> his<00:05:25.919> words<00:05:26.159> but<00:05:26.969> a

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
the unified field his words but a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.619 
the unified field his words but a
non-destructive<00:05:27.770> compression<00:05:28.770> or<00:05:29.069> simply

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
non-destructive compression or simply

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.230 
non-destructive compression or simply
constructive<00:05:30.629> compression<00:05:31.409> of<00:05:31.500> charge<00:05:31.770> so

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
constructive compression of charge so

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.379 
constructive compression of charge so
could<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.539> be<00:05:33.839> the<00:05:34.439> secret<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.389> architecture

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
could that be the secret to architecture

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.179 
could that be the secret to architecture
don't<00:05:37.110> know<00:05:38.599> so<00:05:39.599> essentially<00:05:40.439> compression<00:05:41.069> is

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
don't know so essentially compression is

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.730 
don't know so essentially compression is
about<00:05:41.460> weather<00:05:42.289> information<00:05:43.289> which<00:05:43.560> is

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
about weather information which is

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.969 
about weather information which is
charge<00:05:44.129> can<00:05:44.819> be<00:05:44.969> squeezed<00:05:45.710> efficiently<00:05:46.710> and

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
charge can be squeezed efficiently and

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.570 
charge can be squeezed efficiently and
constructively<00:05:48.500> so<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.680> all<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.039> waves<00:05:50.279> of

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
constructively so that all the waves of

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.129 
constructively so that all the waves of
charge<00:05:50.849> that<00:05:51.029> contain<00:05:51.300> all<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.599> valuable

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
charge that contain all that valuable

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.019 
charge that contain all that valuable
survival<00:05:52.740> information<00:05:53.279> get<00:05:53.669> compressed

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
survival information get compressed

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.290 
survival information get compressed
efficiently<00:05:54.750> and<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.589> turns<00:05:55.889> out<00:05:56.189> that<00:05:56.909> in

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
efficiently and it turns out that in

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.779 
efficiently and it turns out that in

fractal

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
can be compressed perfectly can be

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.100 
can be compressed perfectly can be

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
compressed infinitely can be compressed

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.260 
compressed infinitely can be compressed
non-destructively<00:06:36.920> it's<00:06:37.700> just<00:06:37.940> like<00:06:38.090> there's

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
non-destructively it's just like there's

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.910 
non-destructively it's just like there's
somebody<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.660> love<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.170> you<00:06:39.500> want<00:06:39.680> to<00:06:39.770> give

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
somebody you love and you want to give

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.100 
somebody you love and you want to give
them<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.250> perfect<00:06:40.430> squeeze<00:06:40.970> it<00:06:41.630> turns<00:06:41.930> out

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
them the perfect squeeze it turns out

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.300 
them the perfect squeeze it turns out
that<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.410> perfect<00:06:42.800> squeeze<00:06:43.040> is<00:06:43.280> fractal<00:06:43.900> so

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
that the perfect squeeze is fractal so

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.040 
that the perfect squeeze is fractal so
there's<00:06:46.310> another<00:06:46.640> secret<00:06:47.000> about<00:06:47.540> perfect

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
there's another secret about perfect

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.260 
there's another secret about perfect
squeezing<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:49.130> perfect<00:06:49.550> compression<00:06:50.060> and

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
squeezing and perfect compression and

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.700 
squeezing and perfect compression and
guess<00:06:50.930> what<00:06:51.140> that<00:06:51.170> is

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
guess what that is

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.910 
guess what that is
what's<00:06:52.100> that<00:06:52.340> hint<00:06:52.760> it's<00:06:53.270> golden<00:06:53.720> the<00:06:54.530> golden

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
what's that hint it's golden the golden

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.840 
what's that hint it's golden the golden
mean<00:06:55.070> race<00:06:55.310> yeah<00:06:55.580> golden<00:06:56.150> mean<00:06:56.390> ratio<00:06:57.200> yes<00:06:57.850> so

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
mean race yeah golden mean ratio yes so

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.630 
mean race yeah golden mean ratio yes so
it<00:06:59.240> turns<00:06:59.540> out<00:06:59.780> that<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.530> golden<00:07:00.920> mean<00:07:01.070> ratio

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
it turns out that the golden mean ratio

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.270 
it turns out that the golden mean ratio
because<00:07:02.090> this<00:07:02.630> number<00:07:02.900> point<00:07:03.710> six<00:07:03.920> one<00:07:04.070> eight

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
because this number point six one eight

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.370 
because this number point six one eight
oh<00:07:04.340> three<00:07:04.490> three<00:07:04.910> nine<00:07:04.940> eight<00:07:05.120> nine<00:07:05.330> is<00:07:05.930> the

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
oh three three nine eight nine is the

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.250 
oh three three nine eight nine is the
only<00:07:06.560> ratio<00:07:07.370> that<00:07:07.880> allows<00:07:08.270> a<00:07:08.750> sequence<00:07:09.170> of

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
only ratio that allows a sequence of

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.130 
only ratio that allows a sequence of
numbers<00:07:09.470> to<00:07:09.860> both<00:07:10.100> add<00:07:10.490> and<00:07:10.910> multiply<00:07:11.180> it's

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
numbers to both add and multiply it's

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.680 
numbers to both add and multiply it's
called<00:07:12.350> a<00:07:12.470> sacred<00:07:12.890> cut<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.670> golden<00:07:14.090> mean<00:07:14.270> and

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
called a sacred cut the golden mean and

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.070 
called a sacred cut the golden mean and
it<00:07:15.620> is<00:07:15.830> literally<00:07:16.550> the<00:07:16.790> geometry<00:07:17.480> also<00:07:18.050> a

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
it is literally the geometry also a

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.490 
it is literally the geometry also a
perfect<00:07:18.920> compression<00:07:19.990> so<00:07:21.730> all<00:07:22.730> of<00:07:23.420> biology<00:07:24.260> is

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
perfect compression so all of biology is

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.330 
perfect compression so all of biology is
based<00:07:24.920> almost<00:07:25.450> entirely<00:07:26.450> upon<00:07:27.170> this<00:07:27.410> golden

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
based almost entirely upon this golden

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.760 
based almost entirely upon this golden
mean<00:07:28.550> ratio<00:07:29.150> and<00:07:29.450> for<00:07:30.050> anybody<00:07:30.380> that's

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
mean ratio and for anybody that's

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.260
