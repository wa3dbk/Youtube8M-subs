exhausting<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> figured<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.759> doing<00:00:15.089> pretty

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
enjoyable but it doesn't matter what car

enjoyable but it doesn't matter what car
you<00:00:40.230> drive<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> pitch<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.550> matters

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you drive on the pitch all that matters

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
you drive on the pitch all that matters
it's<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> football<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.590> match<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's the football so the first match is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's the football so the first match is
against<00:00:44.309> Philadelphia<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.210> guys<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
against Philadelphia and guys this is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.799 
against Philadelphia and guys this is
actually<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> MLS<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> US<00:00:48.360> Open

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.130 
actually not in the MLS it's the US Open
Cup<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.260> obviously<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> goes<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.640> cup

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
Cup so obviously it goes by the cup
match<00:00:52.140> system<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.800> means<00:00:53.039> early

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
match system which means early

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
match system which means early

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
elimination so I was hoping that I could

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.610 
elimination so I was hoping that I could

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there but that opportunity is not taken

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
there but that opportunity is not taken
because<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.460> had<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.760> hit<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> post<00:01:09.240> good

first goal here and I actually had

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.380 
first goal here and I actually had
something<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
something to do with that in in that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
something to do with that in in that
move<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.840> uh<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.409> didn't<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.180> wasn't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
move I uh I didn't really like it wasn't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
move I uh I didn't really like it wasn't
crucial<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.920> damn<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
crucial but I was there damn it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.910 
crucial but I was there damn it
and<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.150> yeah<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.110> nil<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> front<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and but yeah we are one nil in front and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.820 
and but yeah we are one nil in front and
then<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.900> something<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.710> different

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
then this this something was different

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
then this this something was different
this<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.189> around<00:01:26.340> look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> break

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this time around look at here I break

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.830 
this time around look at here I break
away<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.790> pace<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.509> strength

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
away I just use my pace was my strength

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
away I just use my pace was my strength
I<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> shot<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> goalkeeper<00:01:32.549> saves

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I take the shot in the goalkeeper saves

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
I take the shot in the goalkeeper saves
it<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.110> different<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it so what was different was that this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.600 
it so what was different was that this
became<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.750> quest<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.409> goal<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.950> did<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
became the quest for a goal I did the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
became the quest for a goal I did the
ball<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.970> after<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> mistake<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.869> cannot

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
ball here after the mistake and I cannot

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.490 
ball here after the mistake and I cannot
