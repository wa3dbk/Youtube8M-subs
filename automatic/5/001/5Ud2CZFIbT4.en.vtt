I<00:01:36.990> figure<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.439> probably<00:01:37.500> okay<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I figure it's probably okay and on to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.719 
I figure it's probably okay and on to
the<00:01:40.920> pants

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.770 

see<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.759> thought<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.030> pants<00:01:52.360> were<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.509> little

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
see I thought the pants were a little

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.969 
see I thought the pants were a little
bit<00:01:52.869> on<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.369> wide<00:01:54.369> side<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.600> an<00:01:55.840> a3<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.770> I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
bit on the wide side this is an a3 and I

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.520 
bit on the wide side this is an a3 and I
thought<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.909> they<00:01:58.720> were<00:01:58.780> whiter<00:01:59.050> than<00:01:59.320> some

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
thought that they were whiter than some

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.930 
thought that they were whiter than some
of<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.649> other<00:01:59.830> ones<00:02:00.070> I've<00:02:00.280> seen

they<00:02:01.479> have<00:02:01.600> hyper<00:02:01.869> fly<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.619> along<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> sides

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
they have hyper fly here along the sides

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.729
