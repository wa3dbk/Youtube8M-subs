00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the problem is sometimes this doesn't

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.599 
the problem is sometimes this doesn't
work<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> auto<00:00:15.900> EQ<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.980> does<00:00:17.130> some<00:00:17.250> funky

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
work with the auto EQ it does some funky

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.450 
work with the auto EQ it does some funky
things<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:18.570> won't<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:19.590> soon<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.130> click<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
things it won't as soon as you click it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
things it won't as soon as you click it
on<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.730> automatically<00:00:21.090> thinks<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.840> know<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
on it automatically thinks you know the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
on it automatically thinks you know the
e<00:00:22.140> breaks<00:00:22.590> off<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.670> problem<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> or

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
e breaks off and the problem is is it or

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.439 
e breaks off and the problem is is it or
you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.529> vice<00:00:25.859> versa<00:00:26.340> whatever<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you know vice versa whatever and when I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.849 
you know vice versa whatever and when I
was<00:00:27.599> trying<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> audio<00:00:28.410> EQ

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
was trying to get into the audio EQ

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.050 
was trying to get into the audio EQ
settings<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> wouldn't<00:00:29.490> let<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
settings it wouldn't let me so what I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060 
settings it wouldn't let me so what I
did<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.080> popped<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.439> deck<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> bit

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
did is I just popped my deck out a bit

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.860 
did is I just popped my deck out a bit
and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.759> take<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.329> green<00:00:33.510> wires

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and then you take one of the green wires

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
and then you take one of the green wires
I<00:00:33.989> can't<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.520> hook<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
I can't one of them if you hook it up to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
I can't one of them if you hook it up to
the<00:00:36.149> hook<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.660> hook<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> ground<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the hook out hook it up to ground it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
the hook out hook it up to ground it
will<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.149> cut<00:00:39.510> your<00:00:39.660> music<00:00:39.960> out

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
will actually just cut your music out

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
will actually just cut your music out
and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.160> disconnect<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and then so you disconnect from that and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
and then so you disconnect from that and
then<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.340> parking

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
then this one which is your parking

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.290 
then this one which is your parking
break<00:00:45.149> ground<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.730> once<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> put<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> wire

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
break ground it is once you put the wire

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
break ground it is once you put the wire
to<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.200> won't<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.980> won't<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.280> any

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to it it won't do it won't have any

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
to it it won't do it won't have any
change<00:00:50.789> really<00:00:51.030> you'll<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:52.320> able<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
change really you'll just go be able to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
change really you'll just go be able to
go<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.890> auto<00:00:53.039> EQ<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:54.329> stuff<00:00:54.600> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
go into your auto EQ and do stuff so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.869 
go into your auto EQ and do stuff so
we're<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> turn<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> radio

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
we're just going to turn the radio

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.020 
we're just going to turn the radio

measurement you just click on it it's
going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> fold<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
know anything else it'll do that and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350 
know anything else it'll do that and
then<00:01:19.650> you'll<00:01:19.770> plug<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> auto<00:01:20.490> EQ<00:01:21.180> mic

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
then you'll plug it into the auto EQ mic

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
then you'll plug it into the auto EQ mic
the<00:01:21.840> best<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.740> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the best is to put it right there on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.870 
the best is to put it right there on
your<00:01:23.070> headrest

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your headrest

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
your headrest
now<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.600> auto<00:01:24.780> EQ<00:01:25.140> mic<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
now this auto EQ mic actually is the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.760 
now this auto EQ mic actually is the
same<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.520> used<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:27.770> amplifiers

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
same one they used for amplifiers

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
same one they used for amplifiers
they're<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.640> cheap<00:01:29.850> mics<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.299> you've<00:01:30.479> got

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
they're really cheap mics if you've got

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
they're really cheap mics if you've got
an<00:01:30.900> amplifier<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.100> could<00:01:32.220> probably<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.610> use

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
an amplifier you could probably just use

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
an amplifier you could probably just use
that<00:01:32.939> mic<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> might<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.380> able

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that mic or you know you might be able

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
that mic or you know you might be able
to<00:01:34.619> purchase<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.220> somewhere<00:01:35.520> for

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
