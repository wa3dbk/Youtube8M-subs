00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
boat moving around this is gonna work

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.230 
boat moving around this is gonna work
out<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.260> lot<00:02:27.440> better<00:02:27.710> than<00:02:27.980> trying<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.310> just<00:02:28.610> fry

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
