00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
of that for some reason but that's just

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
of that for some reason but that's just
my<00:02:02.579> own<00:02:02.729> preference<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.680> side<00:02:05.040> has<00:02:06.110> gold

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
my own preference and the side has gold

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.559 
my own preference and the side has gold
stitching<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.340> can't<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
stitching you can't really see it in the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.120 
stitching you can't really see it in the
video<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.950> bottom

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
video and the bottom

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.210 
video and the bottom
it's<00:02:12.490> gum<00:02:13.090> sole<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:14.320> like<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:15.040> any

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's gum sole but like it's not just any
