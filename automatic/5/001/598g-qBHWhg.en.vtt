is that resolution it will be running

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
is that resolution it will be running
right<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.300> screen<00:02:09.599> resolution

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that they are correct and change these

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.000 
that they are correct and change these
values<00:02:50.990> depending<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.860> be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
values depending on that if I would be

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.980 
values depending on that if I would be
running<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:56.330> 1920<00:02:57.530> pixels<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:59.480> 1080<00:03:00.480> pixels
