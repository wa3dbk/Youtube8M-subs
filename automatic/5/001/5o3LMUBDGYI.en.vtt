is over twice as long and thicker and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
is over twice as long and thicker and
thus<00:01:52.860> keeps<00:01:53.849> the<00:01:54.030> door<00:01:54.179> from<00:01:54.390> coming<00:01:54.689> off<00:01:54.840> the

thus keeps the door from coming off the
hinge<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.500> splitting<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.719> splitting
