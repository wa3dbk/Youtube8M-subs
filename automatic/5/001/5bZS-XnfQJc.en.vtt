00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
through our past meters i think the last

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.030 
through our past meters i think the last
two<00:05:17.960> times<00:05:18.139> we<00:05:18.290> played<00:05:18.380> them<00:05:18.680> back<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:18.950> the

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
two times we played them back in the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.590 
two times we played them back in the
world<00:05:19.220> windsor<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:19.700> local<00:05:20.000> city<00:05:20.210> final

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
world windsor on the local city final

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.810 
world windsor on the local city final
and<00:05:20.690> then<00:05:20.810> we<00:05:21.350> lost<00:05:21.530> some<00:05:21.800> reducing<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.520> i

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
and then we lost some reducing so i

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.190 
and then we lost some reducing so i
think<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.450> good<00:05:23.600> team<00:05:23.810> that's<00:05:24.020> there's<00:05:24.169> a

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
think it's a good team that's there's a

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.900 
think it's a good team that's there's a
lot<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.380> progress<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.919> they<00:05:25.729> had<00:05:25.820> to

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
lot of progress and they had to

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.219 
lot of progress and they had to
continuing<00:05:26.360> progress<00:05:26.570> i'm<00:05:26.870> really<00:05:27.050> going<00:05:27.169> to

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
continuing progress i'm really going to

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.390 
continuing progress i'm really going to
make<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> difficult<00:05:27.530> for<00:05:27.830> us<00:05:28.010> here<00:05:28.160> at<00:05:28.190> home

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
make it difficult for us here at home

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.810 
make it difficult for us here at home
but<00:05:28.639> if<00:05:29.180> we<00:05:29.570> do<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.840> we<00:05:29.990> know<00:05:30.139> we<00:05:30.320> can<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:30.820> you

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
but if we do it we know we can and you

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.070 
but if we do it we know we can and you
know<00:05:31.940> we're<00:05:32.090> sound<00:05:32.360> defensively<00:05:32.840> than<00:05:32.990> I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
know we're sound defensively than I

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.820 
know we're sound defensively than I
think<00:05:33.260> usual<00:05:33.860> it's<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.490> very<00:05:34.850> experienced<00:05:35.419> team

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
think usual it's a very experienced team

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.230 
think usual it's a very experienced team
you<00:05:36.830> know<00:05:36.950> and<00:05:37.130> it's<00:05:37.250> also<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.520> team<00:05:37.790> that<00:05:38.060> a

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
you know and it's also a team that a

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.510 
you know and it's also a team that a
number<00:05:38.540> of<00:05:38.690> guys<00:05:38.960> have<00:05:39.169> either<00:05:39.320> seen<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.800> MLS

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
number of guys have either seen in MLS

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.100 
number of guys have either seen in MLS
or<00:05:40.760> playing<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.600> know<00:05:41.690> CONCACAF

qualifiers<00:05:44.240> for<00:05:44.479> a<00:05:44.780> number<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.080> guys<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:45.680> it's

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
qualifiers for a number of guys so it's

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.770 
qualifiers for a number of guys so it's
an<00:05:46.400> experienced<00:05:46.970> group<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.330> very<00:05:47.540> technical

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
an experienced group a very technical

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.050 
an experienced group a very technical
group<00:05:48.320> and<00:05:48.590> it's<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.070> confident<00:05:49.580> side<00:05:49.760> most

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
group and it's a confident side most

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.210 
group and it's a confident side most
importantly<00:05:50.630> so<00:05:50.990> definitely<00:05:51.800> nothing<00:05:51.979> to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
importantly so definitely nothing to

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.680 
importantly so definitely nothing to
take<00:05:52.370> for<00:05:52.610> granted<00:05:52.820> they've<00:05:53.090> gotten<00:05:53.330> some<00:05:53.510> big

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
take for granted they've gotten some big

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.650 
take for granted they've gotten some big
results<00:05:54.400> in<00:05:55.400> their<00:05:55.580> last<00:05:55.729> couple<00:05:56.090> games<00:05:56.240> so

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
results in their last couple games so

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.510 
results in their last couple games so
right<00:05:57.320> now<00:05:57.350> it's<00:05:57.590> such<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.770> tight<00:05:58.039> race<00:05:58.250> any

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
right now it's such a tight race any
