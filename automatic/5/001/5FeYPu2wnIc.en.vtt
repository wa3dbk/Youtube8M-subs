00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello guys today from the pender blog 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.119
 link we will learn how to prepare 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.920
 Wet food for dogs with 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.599
 natural ingredients so you 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.160
 pets may vary a bit from 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.230
 I think we give them every day of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 dry cookies and those things 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.039
 look at these are the ingredients I'm going 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.150
 to teach and now I tell you the amounts 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.110
 they are pot chickpeas , pot vegetables 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 beef and pork 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
 and we're also going to use liver from 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.530
 chicken 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.510
 a couple of cans of tuna 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 fresh cheese type of burgos or the one that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.660
 have raw eggs and potatoes on hand 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.489
 it already have the overview in 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 mind now we go one by one with all 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.430
 the ingredients 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.430
 800 grams of minced pork is 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.280
 meat and we will cook it after others 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 800 grams of ground beef and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.350
 we're going to leave it raw for 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.940
 save your vitamins and more properties 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.370
 a kilo of boiled potatoes 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.290
 You see that I have left the skin and 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.630
 then we will sting them 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.140
 well let's add two eggs 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.409
 raw 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.300
 more tidbits two cans of tuna I've 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.100
 chosen tuna in olive oil that is 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.900
 very healthy but if your dog is 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.510
 obese or is very sedentary can you use 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.360
 Natural tuna also half a cup of 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.220
 chickpeas from the pot half a bowl of 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 vegetables also from pot that has been 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.680
 taught before and a half bowl of liver 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 chicken that is equivalent to about 200 grams more 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.299
 or less 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.890
 You can see all these quantities in 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.330
 the link that I have put you below that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.280
 is a link to the blog and there it is 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.049
 exactly everything detailed and for 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.540
 finish with the ingredients I will 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.009
 add a fresh cheese from burgos if not 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.450
 you have burgos because what you have in 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.119
 your region has to be simply 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.340
 fresh cheese and just need a bucket where 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.039
 make the mixture of the ingredients and a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.200
 glass jar or film paper for the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.939
 conservation if you have seen other 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
 our recipes as we are going to follow the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.190
 same process to preserve it we are going to 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.739
 Start by cutting the cheese into squares 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.800
 or in tiny little pieces you know that 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.510
 Fresh milk is not good for 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.430
 dogs because they can not digest well the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.500
 lactose can then give them diarrhea 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.140
 but yogurt or this type of cheese 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.299
 cool so they can digest it well and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.700
 experience suits you well 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.060
 Regarding the total recipe this does not arrive 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.280
 or 7% of ingredients since only 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.540
 you can give perfectly has proteins 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.030
 and calcium 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.099
 then let's take the meat from 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.799
 pork and we're going to fry it 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.269
 I am using a non-stick pan 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.459
 why not add anything else oil 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.170
 so that the flesh of 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.590
 pork already has a little fat here 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.319
 incorporated 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.620
 this meat is providing proteins 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.750
 fats vitamins and other nutrients 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.959
 essentials you see what I'm going to do 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.730
 is to cook it little I do not want to look for the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.160
 cook it too much so you do not lose 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.170
 properties 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.730
 now we repeat the process with the liver 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.920
 of chicken to which he has not added 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 Veis oil is only with the pan 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.470
 non-stick the liver is very good 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.550
 because it has therefore taurine vitamin a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.810
 omega 3 omega 6 and from here it is already 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.790
 all super easy in the recipe 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.220
 we just have to apply all 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.110
 the ingredients and as we pick them 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.820
 we're going to put that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.010
 plastic that I have taught you before to 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.760
 make the mixture let's start to stay 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.799
 chopping the potatoes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.380
 you must remember that it was a kilo of 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.990
 boiled potatoes 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.580
 ok as far as you have already go for 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.580
 the bowl to make the mixture 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 the same with chicken liver not 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.560
 we have to crush a little with the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.770
 knife does not need to be perfect 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.770
 and also look at the bowl of the mix 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.370
 now let's take the half cup of 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.079
 chickpeas and before putting it in 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.540
 mix we're going to crush it a bit with 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.400
 I do not recommend a fork 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.370
 put more than half a cup even though 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.170
 could because you may die gassed 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.880
 for your bitch especially if 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.579
 So you have a type of English translation 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.970
 scrambled French easy if friends some 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.190
 dogs have no stone 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.910
 ok now let's add the vegetables 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.100
 they were about 200 grams or so 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.710
 and then the two cans of tuna 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.290
 I 'm not even going to add the juice that was 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.630
 olive oil because it also has 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.090
 vitamins and fats that are healthy and 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.190
 beneficial but I told you that you could 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.740
 do it also with tuna to the natural 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.960
 ok we also add the pork 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.600
 cooked that you see is still steaming 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.610
 and on top of the two raw eggs that 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.340
 this own heat that derives from the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.770
 meat are going to cook a little and already 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.230
 last the beef minced meat that I 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.450
 in my case I prefer not to cook it because 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.390
 This meat allows you to do it like this and 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.130
 will keep more nutrients some me 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.530
 you ask if you can cook the meat 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.510
 Well of course you can put it like me in the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.360
 Non-stick pan or even boil it 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.100
 If you prefer, look after mixing it 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.440
 everything and stir it well has remained this 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.980
 consistency like pasta with with 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.360
 tripping 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.770
 the truth that I have tried it and is 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.080
 super good that is for dogs 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.070
 it has to be valid and now the time has come 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.050
 of conservation 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.270
 you can either put it in jars of 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.670
 crystal and save it a few days in the 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.640
 refrigerator or freeze it and use it when 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.640
 I need you either with the paper 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.860
 cellophane make small sized balls 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.160
 of individual ration according to the large or 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.020
 small that is your dog 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.449
 and for that you put it in the palm of 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.150
 hand 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.819
 you try to get the air out of the inside of 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.159
 pack and turn and so it's already closed 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.779
 then the stuff in a big bag and 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.779
 keep it in the freezer 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.580
 and to look at the result, they marked 35 kilos of 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.490
 food that cost us about 15 euros 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.830
 and this is about 4.5 euros per kilo 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.090
 of a meal of the highest quality and 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.440
 And now I will show that the 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.440
 dogs love this recipe 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.730
 to eat 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.560
 You already know that the Chihuahuas and others 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.540
 small dogs like york size by 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.130
 example are pretty gourmets at the time 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.450
 to eat but I already tell you that with this 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.450
 recipe does not resist anyone 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.910
 because as we have been caught infraganti them 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.800
 I'm going to give a bit of data, although 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.500
 you know we have a specific recipe 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.680
 for cats hanging also in our
