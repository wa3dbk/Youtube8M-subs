 breakpoint to come back to the race 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.110
 also falls under the first half hour 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.400
 and then it must then not be sure if you still want to play football for the benefit 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.709
 of the investigation 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.070
 that is normally a fantastic mine a serious one 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.110
 but in it is stupid that brings 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.220
 I am in the Zuidbroek district that companies must play like a game 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.509
 the suspect resisted the man annoyingly in the culture, I mean that 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.289
 then a fun way of playing football 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 but then have to get it back ten years 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.350
 you are going to explore 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.600
 they play but it is now up to them 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.610
 everything 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.200
 but I really broke everything in old man proud of my pants from 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 smokers about football and handball 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.220
 the consultation was then resumed arib all those trees on the plot 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660
 the 28 year old sahar 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 all the space completely from coach frank is still there 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420
 but there are moments bayern 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.440
 bit stupid mistake but very good business with 40 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 while the ball is in play that companies employees and the government 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.659
 that is already position the solar impulse oscar on 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.800
 if you have two stepping surgery bone fractures on another part of the core 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.220
 it is a drawing against villarreal thought it was a bit too 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.020
 yes but I liked playing football the first half hour 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.900
 I don't imagine anyone being wrong 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.530
 but again if someone is to see what's going on i'll have a look around 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 m 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.660
 whether it also gets there is we still have to go in consultation now we can 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.530
 finally good enough even though it doesn't take me to know what's going on 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.690
 well i have but i still have confidential data 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 The Jan debate also says incredibly much and lots of talent but we refuse 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.640
 are certain moments in which you do yes 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.320
 too easy to handle and ryan babel the water level in the entertainment center then 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.090
 he still has a problem of having a stroke 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.800
 regularly 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.170
 to decide what is going on in the group I think you can also blame it on the boys 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 the bank that could play its position in the rush hour they never signal wrong 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.580
 the zeppelin the viewer feel that i like 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.150
 he may be more than welcome 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
 because that is how you should not be, then you should not see it 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.769
 at least I think that's m 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.760
 the other writers and poets at that time put everything to everything that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.099
 is not bad at all I agree it is better 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.030
 i can imagine that those that are both real madrid i can see now 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.449
 less good for them I don't know if they are there 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.759
 I would not have decided a bit more in the supermarket in Almelo as an interim 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.700
 government under pressure 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.860
 It also means that his choices you make he thinks he's a very good one 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.969
 made preparations 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.180
 I also made two caps in the IJssel, but I can't keep it that way 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.709
 At that level in 2013 it is a bookcase told that they are the creator 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.329
 must be the nothing one that the Norwegian our northern neighbors duels a part of one 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.120
 Samples would be less at that time, saying everyone is natural 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 but is submerged livestock that is more for it 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.379
 the buildings to date have just done very well their own buildings 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.179
 Account there sharper on a duel in Ukraine that in some Turkish 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.409
 top club real again brings high score in the match 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.469
 added value 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.909
 they go up by 93 percent
