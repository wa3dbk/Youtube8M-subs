so<00:04:27.320> many<00:04:27.560> children<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.400> world<00:04:28.580> don't<00:04:29.030> have

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
so many children in the world don't have

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.260 
so many children in the world don't have
access<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:30.230> education<00:04:30.950> because<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.460> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
access to education because of the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.180 
access to education because of the
remote<00:04:32.540> area<00:04:32.960> they<00:04:33.110> live<00:04:33.290> in<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.530> poor<00:04:33.830> ever

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
remote area they live in the poor ever

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.840 
remote area they live in the poor ever
can<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.730> see<00:04:35.030> how<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.830> leaves<00:04:37.070> have<00:04:37.370> dropped

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
can you see how the leaves have dropped

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.050 
can you see how the leaves have dropped
from<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.390> trees<00:04:38.900> that's<00:04:39.650> very<00:04:40.220> near<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.850> where

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
from the trees that's very near to where

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.870 
from the trees that's very near to where
I<00:04:41.120> live<00:04:41.630> but<00:04:41.960> through<00:04:42.500> technology<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.700> can

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
I live but through technology you can

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.600 
I live but through technology you can
get<00:04:44.090> through<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.020> porous<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:46.010> children

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
get through to the porous of children

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.570 
get through to the porous of children
and<00:04:47.480> so<00:04:47.810> garters<00:04:48.200> new<00:04:48.470> teaching<00:04:48.950> methods<00:04:49.280> have

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
and so garters new teaching methods have

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.870 
and so garters new teaching methods have
now<00:04:49.760> also<00:04:50.060> arrived<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:50.870> these<00:04:51.230> shores<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
now also arrived on these shores the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.280 
now also arrived on these shores the
lessons<00:04:53.240> learned<00:04:53.480> from<00:04:53.660> his<00:04:53.840> very<00:04:53.960> first

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
children enjoy it the right answer

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.080 
children enjoy it the right answer
always<00:06:27.140> comes<00:06:27.560> back<00:06:27.770> what<00:06:28.550> is<00:06:28.700> it<00:06:28.850> really

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
always comes back what is it really

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.450 
always comes back what is it really
learning<00:06:29.590> that<00:06:30.590> slaughter<00:06:30.920> that's<00:06:31.220> a<00:06:31.310> lot<00:06:31.430> of

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
learning that slaughter that's a lot of

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.000 
learning that slaughter that's a lot of
stuff<00:06:31.760> I<00:06:31.880> had<00:06:32.060> I<00:06:32.420> wouldn't<00:06:33.140> touch<00:06:33.320> I<00:06:33.680> wouldn't

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
stuff I had I wouldn't touch I wouldn't

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.800 
stuff I had I wouldn't touch I wouldn't
have<00:06:34.130> been<00:06:34.280> able<00:06:34.370> to<00:06:34.520> get<00:06:34.730> this<00:06:34.880> much<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.300> in

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
have been able to get this much in in

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.580 
have been able to get this much in in
such<00:06:36.020> a<00:06:36.050> short<00:06:36.320> time<00:06:36.910> really<00:06:38.170> so<00:06:39.170> I<00:06:39.200> waited<00:06:39.410> for

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
such a short time really so I waited for

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.290 
such a short time really so I waited for
two<00:06:39.830> or<00:06:39.950> three<00:06:39.980> months<00:06:40.130> I<00:06:40.580> went<00:06:40.880> back<00:06:41.090> to<00:06:41.210> the

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
two or three months I went back to the

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.760 
two or three months I went back to the
children<00:06:41.720> asked<00:06:42.110> them<00:06:42.320> the<00:06:42.440> same<00:06:42.470> question

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
children asked them the same question

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.520 
children asked them the same question
this<00:06:43.250> time<00:06:43.330> saying<00:06:44.330> you<00:06:44.600> cannot<00:06:44.930> discuss<00:06:45.350> with

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
this time saying you cannot discuss with

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.780 
this time saying you cannot discuss with
anybody<00:06:45.740> you<00:06:46.040> have<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.310> answer<00:06:46.430> it<00:06:46.730> to

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
anybody you have to answer it to

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.750 
anybody you have to answer it to
yourself<00:06:47.150> and<00:06:47.800> notice<00:06:48.800> very<00:06:48.980> quickly<00:06:49.310> that

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
yourself and notice very quickly that

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.250 
yourself and notice very quickly that
they<00:06:49.940> were<00:06:50.060> answering<00:06:50.420> that<00:06:50.570> everybody<00:06:51.080> was

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
they were answering that everybody was

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.290 
they were answering that everybody was
answering<00:06:51.680> it<00:06:51.800> correctly<00:06:52.160> and<00:06:52.460> they<00:06:53.240> were

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
answering it correctly and they were

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.940 
answering it correctly and they were
answering<00:06:53.690> it<00:06:53.900> with<00:06:54.460> something<00:06:55.460> akin<00:06:56.150> to

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
answering it with something akin to

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.420 
answering it with something akin to
photographic<00:06:57.950> recall<00:06:58.670> so<00:06:59.240> I<00:06:59.440> would<00:07:00.440> tend<00:07:01.250> to

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
photographic recall so I would tend to

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.510 
photographic recall so I would tend to
believe<00:07:02.080> that<00:07:03.080> what<00:07:03.320> we<00:07:03.440> are<00:07:03.530> seeing<00:07:03.770> here<00:07:04.250> is

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
believe that what we are seeing here is

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.120 
believe that what we are seeing here is
deep<00:07:04.850> learning<00:07:05.380> happening<00:07:06.380> through<00:07:06.770> a

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
deep learning happening through a

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.940 
deep learning happening through a
mechanism<00:07:07.960> which<00:07:08.960> is<00:07:09.110> very<00:07:09.290> different<00:07:09.530> from
