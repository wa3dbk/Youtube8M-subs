mirror that I had laying around and I

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.840 
mirror that I had laying around and I
just<00:00:57.230> really<00:00:57.949> liked<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.249> way<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.399> looks<00:00:58.730> I

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
just really liked the way it looks I

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.989

these<00:01:01.999> are<00:01:02.300> completely<00:01:02.749> optional<00:01:03.050> but<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:03.559> also

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
these are completely optional but I also

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.770 
these are completely optional but I also
went<00:01:04.370> ahead<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.700> added<00:01:05.120> some<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.600> these

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
went ahead and added some of these

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.840 
went ahead and added some of these
little<00:01:06.290> rubber<00:01:06.560> feet<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.310> bottom<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.700> my

little rubber feet to the bottom of my
mirror<00:01:08.120> just<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.870> mirror<00:01:09.080> doesn't

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
mirror just so the mirror doesn't

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.320

and here it is I'll finish up with the
mirror<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.990> said<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.500> really

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

give<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:42.960> vanity<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.440> little<00:01:43.830> bit<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
give your vanity a little bit of a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.719 
give your vanity a little bit of a
makeover<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.950> also<00:01:46.950> thought<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.430> quickly

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
makeover I also thought I would quickly

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
makeover I also thought I would quickly
show<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.000> guys<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.690> inside<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> drawer

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
show you guys the inside of the drawer

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
show you guys the inside of the drawer
so<00:01:49.710> basically<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.210> stayed

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so basically the one on the right stayed

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
so basically the one on the right stayed
the<00:01:51.600> same<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:51.960> did<00:01:52.200> change<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the same but I did change up the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
the same but I did change up the
organization<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:53.940> drawer<00:01:54.179> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> left

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
organization of the drawer on the left

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.180 
organization of the drawer on the left
so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.929> thought<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.319> just<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.740> ahead<00:01:55.830> and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
so I thought I would just go ahead and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.719 
so I thought I would just go ahead and
show<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:56.490> guys<00:01:58.069> this<00:01:59.069> is<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> looks

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
before so basically I just decided that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
before so basically I just decided that
I<00:02:04.740> wanted<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.369> drawer<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.850> match<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> drawer

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
I wanted this drawer to match the drawer

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
I wanted this drawer to match the drawer
on<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.720> right<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.710> using<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.220> of

the acrylic storage trays just like the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.949
