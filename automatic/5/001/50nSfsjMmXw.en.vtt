the last four years and we believe that

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.640 
the last four years and we believe that
it's<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.450> be<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.200> for

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Graham Bank in England you can see it is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.980 
Graham Bank in England you can see it is
a<00:01:16.380> flat<00:01:16.860> panel<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:17.940> dinner<00:01:18.240> plate

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.840 

this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> only<00:01:22.500> speaker<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> amplifier

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this is the only speaker the amplifier

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
this is the only speaker the amplifier
has<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.470> covers<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.100> entire

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
has in it this covers the entire

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.570 
has in it this covers the entire
frequency<00:01:26.910> range<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.720> 50<00:01:28.110> cycles<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.770> 20,000

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
frequency range from 50 cycles to 20,000

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.359 
frequency range from 50 cycles to 20,000
cycles<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.960> big<00:01:31.170> news<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.950> reason<00:01:32.280> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
cycles and the big news the reason that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.670 
cycles and the big news the reason that
we<00:01:32.490> chose<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:33.960> has

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
we chose this is because it has has

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
we chose this is because it has has
great<00:01:35.070> off-axis<00:01:35.640> response<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
great off-axis response so it it has it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.880 
great off-axis response so it it has it
does<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.220> hundred<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> forty<00:01:39.300> degrees<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
does a hundred and forty degrees to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.760 
does a hundred and forty degrees to
10,000<00:01:41.820> cycles<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.660> fills<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.229> room<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
10,000 cycles so it fills the room in a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.290 
10,000 cycles so it fills the room in a
new<00:01:43.950> sort<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.759> never<00:01:44.970> been<00:01:45.240> done

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
new sort of way that's never been done

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.919 
new sort of way that's never been done
before<00:01:45.679> so<00:01:46.679> you'll<00:01:46.979> find<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:48.390> amp<00:01:48.750> will

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
before so you'll find that this amp will

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.139 
before so you'll find that this amp will
carry<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.410> much<00:01:49.679> larger<00:01:50.190> venue<00:01:50.610> than<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.910> think

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
carry a much larger venue than you think

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.109 
carry a much larger venue than you think
it<00:01:51.330> normally<00:01:51.840> would<00:01:52.100> now<00:01:53.100> we've<00:01:53.310> paired<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it normally would now we've paired this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.800 
it normally would now we've paired this
great<00:01:54.479> loudspeaker<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:57.259> two<00:01:58.259> channels<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
great loudspeaker with two channels of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.940 
great loudspeaker with two channels of
equalization<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.289> been<00:02:01.440> based<00:02:01.740> on

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
equalization here that has been based on

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.840 
equalization here that has been based on
the<00:02:02.100> parody<00:02:02.550> i<00:02:02.580> eq<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:04.380> entire<00:02:04.920> signal<00:02:05.399> path

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the parody i eq the entire signal path

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.109 
the parody i eq the entire signal path
in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.780> EQ<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.619> upper<00:02:07.979> end<00:02:08.190> stuff<00:02:08.490> is<00:02:08.789> all

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
in the EQ and upper end stuff is all

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.110 
in the EQ and upper end stuff is all
discrete<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.860> quiet<00:02:11.340> very<00:02:11.550> sweet

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
discrete so it's very quiet very sweet

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.770 
discrete so it's very quiet very sweet
sounding<00:02:12.660> very<00:02:12.930> clean<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.850> we've<00:02:14.850> also<00:02:15.090> spent

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
sounding very clean and we've also spent

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.170 
sounding very clean and we've also spent
a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.680> making<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.160> very<00:02:17.370> ergonomic

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
a lot of time on making a very ergonomic

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.880 
a lot of time on making a very ergonomic
enclosure<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.770> handle<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.890> it's
