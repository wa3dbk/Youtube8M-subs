00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.060 

finally<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> welder<00:00:27.869> wedding<00:00:28.259> weld<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.680> good<00:00:28.949> as

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
finally a welder wedding weld as good as

anybody<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:32.129> great<00:00:32.400> welder<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> also

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
anybody a great welder but it also

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.180 
anybody a great welder but it also
duplicates<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> way<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> factory<00:00:34.980> did

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
duplicates the way the factory did

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
duplicates the way the factory did
things<00:00:35.430> real<00:00:35.670> important<00:00:36.150> when<00:00:36.239> you're<00:00:36.360> doing

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
things real important when you're doing

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
things real important when you're doing
a<00:00:36.629> restoration<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.610> spot

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
a restoration there's a lot more to spot

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.140 
a restoration there's a lot more to spot
welding<00:00:39.330> than<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.570> might<00:00:39.839> think<00:00:40.199> a<00:00:40.910> spa<00:00:41.910> well

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
welding than you might think a spa well

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.939 
welding than you might think a spa well
this<00:00:42.480> actually<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.019> ingredients<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.589> a<00:00:43.680> spot

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
this actually the ingredients of a spot

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.040 
this actually the ingredients of a spot
weld<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.629> squeeze<00:00:45.629> pressure<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> current<00:00:47.699> and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
weld is squeeze pressure the current and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.780 
weld is squeeze pressure the current and
the<00:00:49.050> duration<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.309> weld

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
the duration of the weld

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.030 
the duration of the weld
we<00:00:50.970> call<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.989> such<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.739> other

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
we call it the well time such as other

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.220 
we call it the well time such as other
well<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.820> mink<00:00:54.120> weld<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.690> use

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
well there's like mink weld as we use

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.930 
well there's like mink weld as we use
gas<00:00:55.590> wires<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.510> build<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> weld<00:00:58.350> with

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
gas wires and so to build the weld with

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.889 
gas wires and so to build the weld with
resistant<00:00:59.940> spot<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.719> actually

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
resistant spot well that we actually

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.830 
resistant spot well that we actually
only<00:01:01.469> use<00:01:01.789> electricity<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.940> apply<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
only use electricity we apply this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.050 
only use electricity we apply this
current<00:01:04.589> through<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> mantles<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
current through the mantles and the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
current through the mantles and the
coast<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> resistance<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.800> metal<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
coast of the resistance of the metal and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
coast of the resistance of the metal and
it<00:01:08.430> heats<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.630> quickly<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it heats it up very very quickly so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
it heats it up very very quickly so
therefore<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
therefore that we need to have the right

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.080 
therefore that we need to have the right
amount<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.720> current<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.259> at<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.550> very<00:01:14.789> short

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
amount of current and at a very short

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
amount of current and at a very short
time<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> pressure<00:01:16.830> after<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
time and also the pressure after the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.359 
time and also the pressure after the
current<00:01:17.910> is<00:01:18.660> is<00:01:19.110> heating<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.860> panel<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
current is is heating up the panel it's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.040 
current is is heating up the panel it's
extremely<00:01:20.940> important<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> high

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
extremely important to to have a high

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.529 
extremely important to to have a high
pressure<00:01:22.350> applied<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.490> fuses<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
pressure applied that actually fuses the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.719 
pressure applied that actually fuses the
two<00:01:24.570> metals<00:01:25.110> together<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:26.280> applying<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
two metals together to applying the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.570 
two metals together to applying the
current<00:01:27.179> we<00:01:27.330> use<00:01:27.509> copper<00:01:27.810> cables<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.709> we<00:01:29.340> use

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
current we use copper cables and we use

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.580 
current we use copper cables and we use
aluminum<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.979> copper<00:01:31.979> tips<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.959> to<00:01:34.440> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
aluminum and copper tips to to to the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.589 
aluminum and copper tips to to to the
metal<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.099> that<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.789> because<00:01:36.149> they<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.569> a

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
metal and that is because they have a

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.139 
metal and that is because they have a
very<00:01:37.020> low<00:01:37.410> resistance<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:38.190> electricity<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
very low resistance to electricity and

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.669 
very low resistance to electricity and
because<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> copper<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.229> such<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> good

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
because of the copper is such a good

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.469 
because of the copper is such a good
conductor<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.849> not<00:01:41.970> stick<00:01:42.300> together

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
conductor you will not stick together

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
conductor you will not stick together
you<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.050> weld<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.530> copper<00:01:44.069> tips

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you can't weld the two copper tips

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
you can't weld the two copper tips
together<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> resistance<00:01:45.959> well<00:01:46.349> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
together with the resistance well that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.999 
together with the resistance well that
we<00:01:46.739> showing<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.830> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
we showing you here is we we have a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.300 
we showing you here is we we have a
shunt<00:01:50.580> already<00:01:51.500> existing<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.739> metals<00:01:53.069> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
shunt already existing in the metals so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.990 
shunt already existing in the metals so
when<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.910> apply<00:01:54.080> current<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.039> non

conductive area such a you know primer
or<00:02:01.500> paint<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.130> ecoute<00:02:02.610> even<00:02:02.970> in<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.390> case

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
or paint or ecoute even in this case

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.210 
or paint or ecoute even in this case
we're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.959> to<00:02:04.050> look<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> real

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
we're going to look at actually a real

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.639 
we're going to look at actually a real
plastic<00:02:05.520> how<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.569> can<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:06.989> through<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.410> but

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
plastic how we can well through that but

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.669 
plastic how we can well through that but
it<00:02:07.770> shunts<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:08.509> existing<00:02:09.509> weld<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it shunts through existing weld or a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.030 
it shunts through existing weld or a
vise<00:02:11.129> grip<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.670> any<00:02:11.819> other<00:02:12.030> mechanical

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
vise grip or any other mechanical

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.199 
vise grip or any other mechanical
connection<00:02:14.040> between<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.459> two<00:02:14.580> panels<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
connection between the two panels and

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.780 
connection between the two panels and
that<00:02:16.200> way<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.890> confused<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.760> through

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that way we confused it right through

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.610 
that way we confused it right through
and<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:20.730> non-conductive<00:02:21.730> material<00:02:22.599> since<00:02:23.470> we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and on non-conductive material since we

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.250 
and on non-conductive material since we
started<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.220> actually<00:02:24.819> started<00:02:25.209> soir<00:02:25.840> welding

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
started we actually started soir welding

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.789 
started we actually started soir welding
back<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.640> late<00:02:28.299> 80s<00:02:28.659> early<00:02:29.019> 90s<00:02:29.049> but<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.769> a

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
back in the late 80s early 90s but we a

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.530 
back in the late 80s early 90s but we a
lot<00:02:30.189> of<00:02:30.340> things<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:30.670> happen<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.150> use<00:02:31.299> now

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
lot of things that happen we use now

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.539 
lot of things that happen we use now
inverter<00:02:31.959> type<00:02:32.349> technology<00:02:33.040> where<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.370> use

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
inverter type technology where we use

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.630 
inverter type technology where we use
square<00:02:33.819> waves<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.540> high<00:02:35.470> frequency<00:02:36.069> welders

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
square waves and high frequency welders

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
square waves and high frequency welders
but<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.720> also<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.730> prepared<00:02:39.730> data

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
but we also have prepared data

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.390 
but we also have prepared data
automatically<00:02:41.140> right<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> screen

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
automatically right there on the screen

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.309 
automatically right there on the screen
that<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.940> upgradable<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:44.049> flashcard

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
that is upgradable with flashcard

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.880 
that is upgradable with flashcard
technology<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.780> technicians<00:02:47.379> out<00:02:47.650> there

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
technology so the technicians out there

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.559 
technology so the technicians out there
can<00:02:48.099> actually<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.909> information

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
can actually get the information

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.410 
can actually get the information
directly<00:02:50.079> on<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> screen<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.310> that

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
directly on the screen of that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.380 
directly on the screen of that
particular<00:02:52.420> vehicle<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.319> get<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> weld<00:02:53.829> data

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
particular vehicle and get the weld data

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.970 
particular vehicle and get the weld data
you<00:02:55.390> know<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.170> procedures<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.799> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
you know and the procedures that the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.440 
you know and the procedures that the
manufacturers<00:02:57.639> recommend<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:58.329> that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
manufacturers recommend for that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.199 
manufacturers recommend for that
particular<00:02:58.750> panel<00:02:59.260> or<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.709> particular

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
particular panel or that particular

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.900 
particular panel or that particular
particular<00:03:01.209> repair
