00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.360
 brewery goes we bought it with 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.980
 papa michel chabran there are more than seven 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.810
 years and a half now so was at 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.160
 the time a gourmet restaurant where 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.850
 we developed it into a very 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.430
 nice brewery 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.220
 so we turn a brewery 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.510
 in the heart of tain-l'hermitage center 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.610
 behind us are you going to chapel 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.559
 with the hermitage is before us at the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.059
 hills of saint joseph with the castle 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.620
 laps but here and then 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.570
 terraces that are gorgeous all at 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.940
 edge of the rhône then a small fan 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.610
 just for my taste buds of dishes or 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.300
 specialties that you propose it's true 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.739
 that throughout the year 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.540
 we are lucky to have products 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.220
 wonderful and all seasons 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.080
 it is true that at that time we have 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.699
 full summer I really like the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.500
 sharing the little frying that new 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.390
 blow we work at the small bend 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 work after you have the dumplings 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.890
 winter pike truffle well 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.690
 obviously the French toast at the tip of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.740
 novel and the sublime apricot jam 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.680
 that we currently have 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.180
 the apricot shepherd drug question 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.070
 a little jaded what are the little more 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.689
 from the brewery then the most before 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.340
 very low I think it's the landscape 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.649
 that's a life panning panels 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
 which sublimates on the rhone as I 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.070
 told you on the hillsides of the saint 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.869
 Joseph on the castle of Tournon 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.049
 beautiful bridge that crosses the other 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.460
 time and tournon and then a good one 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.189
 everything is said panoramic on the on the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 rhône then the michelin 2014 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.240
 I will only quote his last sentence 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.770
 it's a good table your reaction to 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.600
 the blonde listened was very touched because 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 we received the greedy bib hong has already 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.289
 two years now it's true like a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.670
 foreign and then local customers 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.109
 also that is very important 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.359
 so we're glad it's true we do 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.950
 our maximum we work products 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.030
 wonderful I have a chef in the kitchen who 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.509
 is called emmanuel who is who is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.399

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.359
 a very nice kitchen here is my 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.450
 last question you are the daughter of 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.060
 michel chabran cuisine is that we do not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.920
 presents more chief is there a spirit 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.200
 shops of course she's heartbroken 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 with the breweries for the disert already 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.990
 the gourmet restaurant the bistro 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.420
 declares to valence the ephemeral 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.490
 the tapas side too that was developed 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.410
 for the isère drive chabrot and the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.750
 first and foremost respect for products 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.810
 really seasonality and then the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.770
 customer friendliness 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.720
