00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
account this year and a little bit of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880

last<00:00:36.030> year<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.690> much<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.290> played<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
last year not as much time played but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
last year not as much time played but
still<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.460> still<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:38.730> high<00:00:38.969> 10<00:00:39.540> days<00:00:39.719> or

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
still it's still pretty high 10 days or

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
still it's still pretty high 10 days or
10<00:00:40.260> 1/2<00:00:40.500> days<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> 2.19<00:00:41.879> KD<00:00:42.239> pretty

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
10 1/2 days when the 2.19 KD pretty

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
10 1/2 days when the 2.19 KD pretty
solid<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.320> 1.5<00:00:43.770> winter<00:00:44.219> loss<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.489> thought

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
solid and a 1.5 winter loss I thought

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
solid and a 1.5 winter loss I thought
that'd<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> lot<00:00:45.180> less<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.899> rock<00:00:46.350> solo

there's<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.750> 22<00:01:16.200> Bruegel's<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.680> bet<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:16.890> 50

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
there's like 22 Bruegel's I bet about 50

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
there's like 22 Bruegel's I bet about 50
into<00:01:17.580> those<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.270> 28<00:01:18.990> 29<00:01:19.409> kills<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> excite

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
into those like 28 29 kills to excite

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
into those like 28 29 kills to excite
chokes<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> lot<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> nucleus<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.330> did<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
chokes a lot of nucleus I really did and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
chokes a lot of nucleus I really did and
then<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> pay<00:01:22.920> attention<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
then there will you pay attention to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
then there will you pay attention to
kill<00:01:23.640> chains<00:01:23.909> ultra<00:01:24.299> kills<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
kill chains ultra kills all that kind of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.870 
kill chains ultra kills all that kind of
stuff<00:01:25.020> I've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.409> eight<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.490> 24

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stuff I've got eight there and then 24

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.690 
stuff I've got eight there and then 24
2008<00:01:27.330> pretty<00:01:27.750> solid<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.770> quite<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> few<00:01:29.549> men

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
2008 pretty solid then quite a few men

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
2008 pretty solid then quite a few men
also<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:30.030> 272<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> people<00:01:31.439> want

to see those see how many I've got so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
to see those see how many I've got so
there<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.020> 272<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.070> sure<00:01:35.310> how

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
there you go 272 I'm not really sure how

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
there you go 272 I'm not really sure how
many<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> had<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.060> sprite<00:01:36.299> account<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.259> like

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
many I had on my sprite account but like

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.810 
many I had on my sprite account but like
I<00:01:37.590> said<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.920> check<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> video<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I said go check out the video if you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.170 
I said go check out the video if you
want<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:41.130> stats<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
want in to see see stats on that now the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.340 
want in to see see stats on that now the
score<00:01:42.479> streaks<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.229> think

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
score streaks I don't really think

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.010 
score streaks I don't really think
people<00:01:43.860> care<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.250> those<00:01:44.520> ones<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.119> well<00:01:45.299> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
people care about those ones as well so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.120 
people care about those ones as well so
a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.259> people<00:01:46.350> care<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> weapons

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
a lot of people care about the weapons

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.719 
a lot of people care about the weapons
though<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> ballista<00:01:49.130> 36,000<00:01:50.130> kills<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.490> start

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
though so ballista 36,000 kills I start

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.080 
though so ballista 36,000 kills I start
to<00:01:50.880> bad<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.509> 10<00:01:51.810> days<00:01:51.990> played<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.770> 56<00:01:53.460> point<00:01:53.729> 42

to bad in 10 days played as 56 point 42
percent<00:01:54.390> accuracy<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
percent accuracy that's pretty good and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.929 
percent accuracy that's pretty good and
2.06<00:01:57.149> KD<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:59.340> enjoyed<00:01:59.610> using<00:01:59.790> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
2.06 KD so I really enjoyed using this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
2.06 KD so I really enjoyed using this
gun<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> first<00:02:01.170> got<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> game

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
gun a lot more when I first got the game

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
gun a lot more when I first got the game
I<00:02:01.890> barely<00:02:02.310> used<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> didn't<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.479> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I barely used it I didn't like it all I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
I barely used it I didn't like it all I
was<00:02:03.719> working<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> DSR<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> tell

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
was working the DSR and you can tell

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
was working the DSR and you can tell
that<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.610> use<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> account<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.290> more<00:02:07.469> after

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that I use this account a lot more after

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.609 
that I use this account a lot more after
the<00:02:07.829> patch<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.819> DSR<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the patch because the DSR was way at the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.350 
the patch because the DSR was way at the
top<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.069> other<00:02:11.340> account<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
top on my other account and this one is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.960 
top on my other account and this one is
third

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
third

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.670 
third
so<00:02:13.090> pretty<00:02:13.660> strange<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.110> me<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.560> up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so pretty strange for me to see it up

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.340 
so pretty strange for me to see it up
but<00:02:14.860> obviously<00:02:15.570> Vonderhaar<00:02:16.570> he<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.020> just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
but obviously Vonderhaar he just just

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.840 
but obviously Vonderhaar he just just
destroyed<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.190> destroyed<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.610> gun

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
destroyed it it just destroyed the gun

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.090 
destroyed it it just destroyed the gun
but<00:02:19.360> if<00:02:19.420> we've<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> xpr<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.320> 54<00:02:20.830> percent

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
but if we've got the xpr here 54 percent

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.080 
but if we've got the xpr here 54 percent
accuracy<00:02:21.370> I'm<00:02:21.550> pretty<00:02:21.730> happy<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.030> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
accuracy I'm pretty happy with that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
accuracy I'm pretty happy with that
actually<00:02:22.480> because<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.840> semi-auto

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
actually because it's semi-auto

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.260 
actually because it's semi-auto
and<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.370> easy<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.820> miss<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.210> of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
and it's just so easy to miss a lot of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.450 
and it's just so easy to miss a lot of
shots<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.320> with<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.530> KD<00:02:26.920> when

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
shots as you can see with the KD when

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.040 
shots as you can see with the KD when
you<00:02:27.580> do<00:02:27.730> use<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.030> well<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.720> get<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> pretty

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
you do use it well and you get a pretty

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.020 
you do use it well and you get a pretty
accurate<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> pretty<00:02:30.280> good<00:02:30.430> KD<00:02:30.700> so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
accurate you get a pretty good KD so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.700 
accurate you get a pretty good KD so
better<00:02:31.330> one<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.470> it's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
better one with that and then it's

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.800 
better one with that and then it's
better<00:02:32.890> than<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.130> DSR<00:02:33.580> as<00:02:33.730> well<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.120> accuracy<00:02:34.720> is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
better than a DSR as well so accuracy is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.840 
better than a DSR as well so accuracy is
pretty<00:02:34.900> solid<00:02:35.140> with<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.560> 57%<00:02:36.250> pretty<00:02:36.670> much

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
pretty solid with that 57% pretty much

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.540 
pretty solid with that 57% pretty much
on<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.090> 2.08<00:02:37.510> KD<00:02:38.260> now<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.100> guys<00:02:39.280> know<00:02:39.520> I

gonna roll through this pretty quickly

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.280

so<00:03:20.800> combat<00:03:21.430> record<00:03:21.640> time<00:03:22.450> played<00:03:22.720> 15<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
so combat record time played 15 and a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.800 
so combat record time played 15 and a
half<00:03:23.410> days<00:03:23.709> not<00:03:24.400> too<00:03:24.610> bad<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:25.120> think<00:03:25.450> I'd<00:03:25.570> maybe

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
half days not too bad I think I'd maybe

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.449 
half days not too bad I think I'd maybe
three<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.290> half<00:03:26.380> days<00:03:26.620> before<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.070> came<00:03:27.280> back

three and a half days before I came back

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.400 
three and a half days before I came back
to<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.760> game<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.330> we're<00:03:29.050> gonna<00:03:29.170> come<00:03:29.380> back

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
to this game in we're gonna come back

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.770 
to this game in we're gonna come back
March<00:03:29.860> or<00:03:30.190> April<00:03:30.610> or<00:03:30.970> whenever<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.510> came<00:03:31.600> back

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
March or April or whenever it came back

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.540 
March or April or whenever it came back
to<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.019> game<00:03:32.200> how<00:03:32.739> do<00:03:32.800> you<00:03:33.010> don't<00:03:33.160> put<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> lot

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
to this game how do you don't put a lot

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.890 
to this game how do you don't put a lot
of<00:03:33.670> time<00:03:33.820> into<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.180> especially<00:03:34.510> when<00:03:34.720> making

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
of time into it especially when making

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.050 
of time into it especially when making
example<00:03:35.380> 5<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.950> making<00:03:36.250> videos<00:03:36.820> on<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.030> regular

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
example 5 and making videos on a regular

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.940 
example 5 and making videos on a regular
basis<00:03:37.690> I'll<00:03:37.959> put<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.470> link<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.860> description

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
basis I'll put a link in the description

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.410 
basis I'll put a link in the description
for<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.550> sprite<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.820> can't<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.180> hopefully<00:03:40.390> I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
for the sprite you can't and hopefully I

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.670 
for the sprite you can't and hopefully I
can<00:03:40.570> find<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.989> video<00:03:41.200> because<00:03:41.470> that's

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
can find that video because that's

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.020 
can find that video because that's
probably<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.980> few<00:03:42.130> years<00:03:42.160> old<00:03:42.489> down<00:03:42.670> there

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
probably a few years old down there

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.280 
probably a few years old down there
we've<00:03:43.120> got<00:03:43.239> winter<00:03:43.450> laughs<00:03:43.720> there's<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.080> one

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
we've got winter laughs there's a one

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.570 
we've got winter laughs there's a one
that<00:03:44.470> probably<00:03:44.799> should<00:03:44.980> be<00:03:45.010> negative<00:03:45.489> because

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
that probably should be negative because

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.150 
that probably should be negative because
I've<00:03:45.760> got<00:03:45.910> 12<00:03:46.209> more<00:03:46.840> losses<00:03:47.110> but<00:03:47.410> whatever<00:03:47.739> I'm

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
I've got 12 more losses but whatever I'm

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.650 
I've got 12 more losses but whatever I'm
not<00:03:48.220> gonna<00:03:48.489> jam<00:03:48.790> not<00:03:49.090> gonna<00:03:49.180> judge<00:03:49.450> the

not gonna jam not gonna judge the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.750 
not gonna jam not gonna judge the

31<00:03:52.330> don't<00:03:53.110> really<00:03:53.290> remember<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.709> game<00:03:53.890> might

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
have him from years ago I have no idea

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.509 
have him from years ago I have no idea
because<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.860> probably<00:03:57.010> changed<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.400> game

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
because I probably changed the game

screwed<00:04:02.500> out<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.799> 29th<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.549> was<00:04:03.700> going

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
screwed out the 29th when I was going

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.610 
screwed out the 29th when I was going
for<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.060> headshot<00:04:04.690> only<00:04:05.049> free<00:04:05.230> throw<00:04:05.470> whole

for that headshot only free throw whole

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.170 
for that headshot only free throw whole
challenge<00:04:05.860> but<00:04:06.519> I'll<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:06.640> scroll<00:04:06.970> through

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
challenge but I'll just scroll through

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.640 
challenge but I'll just scroll through
these<00:04:07.330> don't<00:04:07.600> run<00:04:07.720> think<00:04:07.959> people<00:04:08.260> care<00:04:08.440> too

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
these don't run think people care too

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.650 
these don't run think people care too
much<00:04:08.680> about<00:04:08.830> those<00:04:09.220> onto<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.120> weapons<00:04:10.450> though

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
much about those onto the weapons though

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.410 
much about those onto the weapons though
I<00:04:10.959> have<00:04:11.320> got<00:04:11.500> 2.3<00:04:11.950> 1kd<00:04:12.549> pretty<00:04:12.910> nice<00:04:13.120> pretty

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
I have got 2.3 1kd pretty nice pretty

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.750 
I have got 2.3 1kd pretty nice pretty
nice<00:04:13.630> I'll<00:04:13.900> take<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.320> accuracy<00:04:15.220> overall<00:04:15.670> is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
nice I'll take it accuracy overall is

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.789 
nice I'll take it accuracy overall is
thirty<00:04:16.060> four<00:04:16.330> and<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.540> half<00:04:16.570> percent<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:17.320> guess

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
thirty four and a half percent I guess

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.110 
thirty four and a half percent I guess
that's<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.040> lot<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.250> regular<00:04:18.549> stuff<00:04:18.790> there<00:04:18.970> as

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
that's a lot of regular stuff there as

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.330 
that's a lot of regular stuff there as
well<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.600> best<00:04:20.320> kill<00:04:20.530> streak<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.830> 40<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.190> might

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
well and best kill streak is 40 I might

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.950 
well and best kill streak is 40 I might
even<00:04:21.459> still<00:04:21.760> have<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.060> gameplay<00:04:22.479> I<00:04:22.510> remember

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
even still have that gameplay I remember

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.600 
even still have that gameplay I remember
just<00:04:23.050> picking<00:04:23.349> up<00:04:23.440> loads<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.740> guns<00:04:23.919> on<00:04:24.130> jungle

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
just picking up loads of guns on jungle

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.230 
just picking up loads of guns on jungle
so<00:04:25.240> maybe<00:04:25.960> I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
so maybe I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.700 
so maybe I
at<00:04:26.479> some<00:04:26.690> point<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.110> just<00:04:27.259> a<00:04:27.289> multi<00:04:27.560> gun

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
at some point it's just a multi gun

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.950 
at some point it's just a multi gun
gameplay<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:29.000> then<00:04:29.270> we've<00:04:29.360> got<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.600> accuracy

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
gameplay and then we've got the accuracy

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.420 
gameplay and then we've got the accuracy
with<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.080> n86<00:04:30.500> there<00:04:30.710> fifty<00:04:31.009> seven<00:04:31.250> point

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
with the n86 there fifty seven point

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.800 
with the n86 there fifty seven point
five<00:04:31.580> one<00:04:31.789> percent<00:04:32.180> are<00:04:32.270> pretty<00:04:32.419> happy<00:04:32.720> with

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
five one percent are pretty happy with

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230 
five one percent are pretty happy with
that<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.139> sixty<00:04:33.500> seven<00:04:33.830> thousand<00:04:34.310> kills<00:04:34.520> which

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
that in sixty seven thousand kills which

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.300 
that in sixty seven thousand kills which
is<00:04:35.449> a<00:04:35.479> which<00:04:36.199> is<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.380> lot<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.650> kills<00:04:36.860> right<00:04:37.130> there

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
is a which is a lot of kills right there
