00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
just before he lands on top of your area

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.059 
just before he lands on top of your area
seems<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.569> always<00:02:00.989> make<00:02:01.200> him<00:02:01.349> jump<00:02:01.590> backwards

seems to always make him jump backwards

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.249 
seems to always make him jump backwards
which<00:02:03.000> gives<00:02:03.239> you<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.509> enough<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
which gives you just enough time to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.809 
which gives you just enough time to
destroy<00:02:04.439> him<00:02:04.799> before<00:02:04.890> he<00:02:05.189> gets<00:02:05.369> back<00:02:05.459> here

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
destroy him before he gets back here

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.779

away<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:07.170> solid<00:02:07.619> enough<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.519> still

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
away it's solid enough but they still

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.210 
away it's solid enough but they still
act<00:02:08.940> totally<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.599> whack<00:02:09.720> sometimes<00:02:10.379> it's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
act totally out of whack sometimes it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680

more threatening as it goes on and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.369 
more threatening as it goes on and
although<00:03:55.879> that<00:03:56.030> sounds<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.780> note<00:03:57.049> ship

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.320 
statement I mean more in their
appearance<00:03:59.690> than<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.019> do<00:04:00.079> their<00:04:00.410> difficulty
