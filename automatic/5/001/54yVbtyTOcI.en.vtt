obliques and I'll swap the training
round<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.939> next<00:01:35.119> time<00:01:35.360> focus<00:01:36.020> more<00:01:36.200> on<00:01:36.229> ab

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
round so the next time focus more on ab

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.050 
round so the next time focus more on ab
leaks<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.799> core<00:01:37.070> work<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:37.549> obviously

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
leaks and core work and then obviously

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060 
leaks and core work and then obviously
so<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.720> sounds<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.320> lot<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.799> different

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
so it sounds like a lot of different

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.760 
so it sounds like a lot of different
exercises<00:01:40.610> yes<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.930> is<00:01:42.110> yeah<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.560> it's

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
exercises yes it is yeah and it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.960 
exercises yes it is yeah and it's
targeting<00:01:43.280> different<00:01:43.400> parts<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
targeting different parts of the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.490 
targeting different parts of the
midsection<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.600> not<00:01:44.750> just<00:01:44.990> upper<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.380> lower

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
midsection it's not just upper and lower

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.289 
midsection it's not just upper and lower
I'm<00:01:45.920> hitting<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.280> Bleek's<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.090> core

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
I'm hitting the Bleek's that the core

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.810 
I'm hitting the Bleek's that the core
the<00:01:47.479> tightness<00:01:47.840> everything<00:01:48.400> and<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.610> lot<00:01:49.790> of

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
the tightness everything and a lot of

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.280 
the tightness everything and a lot of
different<00:01:49.970> types<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.450> equipment<00:01:50.930> or<00:01:51.049> are<00:01:51.170> you

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
different types of equipment or are you

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.749 
different types of equipment or are you
more<00:01:51.470> just<00:01:51.740> into<00:01:52.130> body<00:01:52.310> weight

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
more just into body weight

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.460 
more just into body weight
I<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.540> body<00:01:53.780> weight<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.140> do<00:01:54.229> like

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
I do like body weight but I do like

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.600 
I do like body weight but I do like
obviously<00:01:54.829> I<00:01:54.920> was<00:01:55.040> saying<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.310> heavy<00:01:55.520> weight

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
obviously I was saying to heavy weight

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.340 
obviously I was saying to heavy weight
so<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:55.970> do<00:01:56.060> start<00:01:56.450> without<00:01:56.720> hanging<00:01:56.930> leg<00:01:57.110> raises

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
so I do start without hanging leg raises

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.859 
so I do start without hanging leg raises
with<00:01:57.560> weights<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.700> my<00:01:58.970> legs<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.750> give

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
with weights on on my legs just to give

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.929 
with weights on on my legs just to give
that<00:01:59.899> extra<00:02:00.049> weight<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.710> weighted<00:02:01.520> crunches

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
that extra weight and weighted crunches

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.310 
that extra weight and weighted crunches
I<00:02:02.030> always<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> weights<00:02:02.659> first<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.229> then

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
I always do the weights first and then

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.480 
I always do the weights first and then
I'll<00:02:03.409> go<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.649> own<00:02:03.829> body<00:02:04.040> weight<00:02:04.220> when<00:02:04.369> I'm

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
I'll go on to own body weight when I'm

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.069 
I'll go on to own body weight when I'm
slightly<00:02:04.909> tired<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.509> fatigued
