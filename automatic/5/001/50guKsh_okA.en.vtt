00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 it's everybody it's proposed on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.259
 found for a commented part on a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.570
 gameplay in its amap slideshow which is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.269
 really made a man preferred over 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.590
 adam silver because it's a brand 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.630
 I would say who is really open 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 about open with Spain who 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.230
 are really accurate and that's what 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.180
 I love it with my place and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.769
 space are very predictable and that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 gives moments where there is a lot of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.890
 world are concentrated and since these 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 tablecloths with long distances and who 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.279
 alas is open it's really more 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 enough for little arsenal in front of several 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 types of dating that that's why 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 is this my favorite thing 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 moment on abc oif in the new mac 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 evoke as I meant at the beginning 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 and it does not smell good gameplay but a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 very good gameplay of a Resistance game 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 the first good gameplay I had 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 I read a lot many more 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.860
 since but I have entered them because 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.090
 that if she puts first good and I am 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.940
 a different vision too 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 so that's it then I 'd like you 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.789
 talk a little bit about the facts of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.039
 milk clip will be tomorrow it's horror 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.739
 so yes I got my first clip 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.260
 I got some keys not in the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.220
 new map pack with the after the patch 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.670
 so what I do not think is how 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 I say 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
 I think continue to haunt will decipher 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.869
 surfers for another moment I 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 no longer go multihull it's sure that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 the more you took the start 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.619
 I will return to black ops hard 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020
 because it's the closest game 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.759
 that I like in second place so I 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.280
 do a lot of blackhawks 2 and a lot 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.290
 insurers and what I 'm doing for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 brass on anna surf it goes there that I 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 I'm really proud no one on the wire 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 all the girls that's going to be the ones 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 mythical islands and close them our 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 mouth because tests for sure 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.640
 but gÃ©rard foul is on it if 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.570
 I managed to have once in your 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.280
 camp but I'm like a little clip 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.840
 excluding the thread so all that goes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 maybe split I do not know yet 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 but all that will be there etc 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.229
 I will not go into consideration 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 because I like heap-based 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.079
 filthy who loves because that's 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 really hot mission tape more accurate 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.420
 and to the tackles more meaning for them 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 clips 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.509
 so that's going to be that time I used it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.619
 to not use a blue you have challenges 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 who are not only going to find me 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.730
 way too long so that's it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.400
 so calm in the autumn is sure 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.010
 they are 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 entry under water I would say very faithful 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.439
 so on a negative side but for the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.239
 still it will still very often 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.090
 on our servers 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.829
 I still managed in time well 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 controlled the sniper against the mans against 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.579
 the enemies even if everything happened if 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.930
 alger labs say it's just time 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.269
 girls changing but I was 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.040
 still able to return clubs and 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.290
 especially now that vick saw that there is a 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.489
 heap of music and the finding is that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.750
 that's the goal because 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.519
 it's funny and what point can the most 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.590
 quickly possible you know I say 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.329
 but not some skill h7 diabate's 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.190
 tamimi shot to try to have a 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.500
 musical in it so possible to really 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.790
 worked on succeed whoever takes them 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.150
 my most successful times are as much 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 stay on the timing of the missile so this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.519
 bucket that I like also of opinion on 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.260
 fire that side because it's by 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.239
 taste guitars that fights like this 2 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 may suppose that is that I find 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.959
 that it's still the advantage of playing 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 on their dolphin put it for sure that I 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.670
 not going to come in so much good clip but 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.109
 it's still possible 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.879
 so that's why I find that 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.090
 it is still a winded side 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.359
 to play surf on this side there so 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.699
 otherwise right now with the map with a 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.750
 mattress that evokes a game really I 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.269
 leave you i'll check make a 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.440
 video and audio are bi but people 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.659
 forget that in collective management 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.569
 did not work so I did not try 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.799
 still the zombie for this program 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.540
 we will wait a little bit I want to leave 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.560
 try it for what it tried and we 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.239
 should try next a manet so if 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.519
 it's frozen it's going too 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.260
 if you want a little more than midi code 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.150
 I thought it was mostly black ops 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.139
 208 play her latest clips so that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.659
 you have a little more back up 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.849
 the and did you like yourself 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.239
 me too a little other gifts said 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.769
 as on the side of his two hearts says that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.319
 I will have a little more 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.329
 the agreement is also I do not have a blue v3 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.379
 so I can not really see politics 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.949
 cat and even and so this is this segment 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.030
 is negative 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.500
 by the way, go and take them 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 sure they are often not very very 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.979
 expensive but right now I do not know so 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.650
 I can sometimes videos right now 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.349
 above but as I said m before sofia 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.489
 seed is still a game that 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.709
 still attracts me even though it is 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.090
 sure as I was frustrated so 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.610
 what I realize I can for a 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.870
 threesome tanguay pavin that before but we 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.050
 get used to getting paused 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.479
 so worse than that so if that that I 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.020
 really wanted to addressed today in 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.600
 this video 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.080
 otherwise what I would like to talk to you about 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.400
 as well 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.990
 it is in relation to the facts of this case 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.300
 makes innovations on their brothers 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.320
 because the nac 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.690
 the weather is much less 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.190
 the more I wonder the name is also 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.280
 still as I said it's still 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.020
 more and more difficult to start the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.340
 judge the clips then that's it or is it 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.630
 that I will use more class 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.860
 now what I considered that the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.810
 dead if it's to have mosques the 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.000
 clemency or the atlas is what the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.680
 Swiss are still possible to do 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.840
 since they are really effective I 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.650
 do not know how it's going to be so 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.720
 easy as that on board but that's it 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.330
 otherwise right now maybe I have a 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.770
 blackhawks montage 2 that will be done 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.860
 edit or leaving reindeer did not exist 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.600
 I do not know yet so that's it I 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.310
 surrendered the keys of their soldiers compose 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.960
 two showers should except one and I 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.370
 could never use who had to do 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.110
 a big montage is finally the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.180
 editing was canceled but I still 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.620
 all the clips and well I'm there and 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.150
 some good clubs in there but I have 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.169
 decided to put in an episode when 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.130
 do an episode of the cause of I 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.570
 find it's the right time often 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.650
 that I really like my return on 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.270
 bakiev two other agreements that makes 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.740
 long time that my poor sir I 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.570
 think it's time to do a little 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.460
 of the capsule is to show a montage 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.500
 and back of the head so six the agent one 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.660
 episode of hamla surf and black ops 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.020
 two who will go out in not too much 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.210
 long time 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.729
 so if sky fun and if not after this 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.590
 so that's for sure is a precious these two 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.090
 episodes the 6th that I will find 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.620
 politicians know them to choose 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.289
 do I blame myself on the hull of 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.820
 rena sofer champions league hull so I 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.180
 do not really know yet here 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.289
 questions so I think had everything for 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.150
 today's video everyone 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.639
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.900
 and I hope you liked it so 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.370
 his gm left a comment
