trucks and buses you know ten percent

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.650 
trucks and buses you know ten percent
growth<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.400> seven<00:05:45.729> years<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.150> double<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.630> i

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
growth in seven years you double it i

become<00:05:50.530> oh<00:05:50.860> I<00:05:51.310> think<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:51.729> can<00:05:51.880> easily<00:05:51.970> be<00:05:52.150> 30<00:05:52.450> to

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
become oh I think it can easily be 30 to

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.830 
become oh I think it can easily be 30 to
40<00:05:52.900> million<00:05:53.400> vehicles<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.520> year<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:55.539> reason

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
40 million vehicles a year the reason

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.110 
40 million vehicles a year the reason
for<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.320> that<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:57.430> know<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.610> 20<00:05:57.849> million

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
for that is that you know the 20 million

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.670 
for that is that you know the 20 million
vehicles<00:05:58.510> that<00:05:58.660> you<00:05:58.720> referenced<00:05:59.289> are<00:05:59.410> really

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680

that<00:06:04.870> could<00:06:04.960> produced<00:06:05.349> every<00:06:05.560> year<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:05.979> you

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
that could produced every year that you

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.350 
that could produced every year that you
would<00:06:06.280> look<00:06:06.430> at<00:06:06.639> and<00:06:06.669> say<00:06:07.090> that<00:06:07.240> they're

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
would look at and say that they're

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.510 
would look at and say that they're
really<00:06:07.479> not<00:06:07.690> can<00:06:08.099> conventional<00:06:09.099> and<00:06:09.370> what's

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
really not can conventional and what's

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.760 
really not can conventional and what's
happening<00:06:09.970> is<00:06:10.120> you're<00:06:10.720> converting<00:06:11.470> these

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
happening is you're converting these

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.710 
happening is you're converting these
unconventional<00:06:12.280> vehicles<00:06:13.120> into

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
unconventional vehicles into

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.719 
unconventional vehicles into
conventional<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:14.979> would<00:06:15.250> say<00:06:15.430> that<00:06:15.610> the

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
conventional so I would say that the

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.000 
conventional so I would say that the
demand<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.810> annual<00:06:17.200> demand<00:06:17.560> for<00:06:17.889> new

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
demand the annual demand for new

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.010 
demand the annual demand for new
transportation<00:06:18.430> every<00:06:19.000> year<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.360> probably

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
transportation every year is probably

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.930 
transportation every year is probably
more<00:06:20.440> in<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.680> order<00:06:20.889> of<00:06:20.979> 50<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.370> 60<00:06:21.729> million

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
more in the order of 50 to 60 million

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.510 
more in the order of 50 to 60 million
now<00:06:22.570> when<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.050> say<00:06:23.080> none<00:06:23.740> conventional

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
now when you say none conventional

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.860 
now when you say none conventional
vehicles<00:06:25.000> you<00:06:25.090> mean<00:06:25.240> like<00:06:25.450> these<00:06:25.570> little

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
conventional and so as that process goes

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.450
