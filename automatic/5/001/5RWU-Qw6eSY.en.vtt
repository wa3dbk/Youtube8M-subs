00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 comics usa tip i got this year 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 I thought I could just do it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.859
 a bit of a little video diary 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.500
 I have no idea how it works 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.660
 will go out 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 but yes i hope i can 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.970
 is reasonably entertaining is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 I think a bit 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.030
 develop and now only this way 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.649
 in the beginning so the introduction of the group 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 and I already have a lot of content 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.790
 also pre-produced just because of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 This was my wife and four weeks 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.430
 I'm not there now and in the us 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 are and yes what I did not want now 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 so say that is robbie and my 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 content always comes back to 1 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.070
 and here I try somehow like that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 indeed he cut together bit by bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.390
 so two three minutes longer is always 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 a little bit longer 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.629
 boring always 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.560
 and what have we done so far 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.010
 We have arrived in Los Angeles now 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 in the hotel and have all our four 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 case four suitcases age like that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 it is necessary to say that one is one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 So , as a clammy woman, you're a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.229
 clap one's clothes one is natural 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.990
 one is like you and we have one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 actually such a suitcase with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 backpack still in it you can see the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.259
 actually still not quite then 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.720
 we actually still came quite a lot 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.610
 so office for me so we got there 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.140
 because the laptop or both laptops in it 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 we have the folder of mine in it 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.619
 then have loose in it we have din a4 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 Paper in there because we're here in America 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.600
 I have another format last time 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 I experienced or memorized him because I saw him 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 as soon as we are at steve, we learn too 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.579
 still knows this time off I guess 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.850
 Tuesday today Sunday 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.219
 he also got to know the steve 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.950
 and there I will be very much 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.039
 also quite normal that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.530
 Working the lifestyle would rattle 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.840
 say 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.819
 and yes let's see if we do the whole thing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 here very nicely done as I said 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.410
 we are on the way now we are at 9 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.260
 clock in munich departed 9 o'clock am 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.599
 sunday is now with us too 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.160
 sunday evening at 22 o'clock in adelaide the 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.650
 means plus nine hours I believe it 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.599
 It is 7 o'clock that is we are 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.160
 now at least 26 hours 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.239
 On the way we are awake even longer 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 or my wife, I think 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.680
 had a little sleep from saturday 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 on sunday I thought oh 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.049
 Do you know what licking fireworks worth 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.110
 not at all and first broken 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.660
 and now go only once skip the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.950
 showering then penn was and i think so 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.630
 go tomorrow morning at eight and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.579
 be twelve out of the hotel house 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.590
 we finally want to have breakfast early 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.730
 I called the order 8:00 I watch times 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.970
 me around here 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.709
 if there is a screen around here 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.209
 I actually have to be a motor 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.000
 elvis board and middle bensch and yes 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.560
 even definitely training day and yes 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.010
 I would not like to miss that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.239
 Especially because the hobby and I have to 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.230
 example is a bit on the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.970
 circuit a bit awkward 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.319
 tip-in pinnschmidt so there comes from opel 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.819
 also determines what yes and yes I believe 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.959
 this video I can now so high 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.670
 as it is because it is long enough 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 got enough babble and yes me 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.739
 mark that over me to the usa blog or 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 something like that or usa 2015 so that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.400
 People just interested in these too 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.780
 they do not have to click on it 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.950
 stop some who are interested 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 less for me but just for 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.030
 the content which is also the good thing 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.920
 is from the people and that should 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.859
 Just do not have to look, I say 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.900
 Otherwise, see you soon 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.030
 next day again at day 2 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.030
 probably it'll be fine by then
