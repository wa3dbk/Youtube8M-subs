00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and optical image stabilization so then

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.470 
and optical image stabilization so then
if<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.780> look<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> audio<00:00:43.980> story<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.940> this

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
this device so one of the new things

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.410 
this device so one of the new things
that<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.240> were<00:02:00.390> talking<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:02.420> nokia

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that we were talking about is nokia

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.520 
that we were talking about is nokia
camera<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.119> new<00:02:06.119> application<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
camera so this is a new application that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.940 
camera so this is a new application that

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
camera modes within the within this

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.750 
camera modes within the within this
application<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.680> option<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.400> use

application so you have option to use

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.690 
application so you have option to use
low<00:02:18.150> key<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> pro<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.830> you're<00:02:20.160> familiar<00:02:20.340> with
