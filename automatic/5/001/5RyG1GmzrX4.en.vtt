this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.950> newest<00:00:04.950> project<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.899> got<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.910> box

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
this is my newest project I got this box

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.980 
this is my newest project I got this box
off<00:00:09.349> used<00:00:10.349> P<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:11.059> it<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> modal<00:00:12.630> master

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
off used P I it is a modal master

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
off used P I it is a modal master
eliminator<00:00:13.730> power<00:00:14.730> box<00:00:14.969> 1200<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
eliminator power box 1200 and it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.620 
eliminator power box 1200 and it's
basically<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> generator<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.390> uses

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
basically a generator that uses

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.730 
basically a generator that uses
batteries<00:00:19.260> instead<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> gas<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:23.240> it's<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
batteries instead of gas so it it's a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
batteries instead of gas so it it's a
1200<00:00:25.740> watt<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.279> includes<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> 1200<00:00:27.240> watt

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
1200 watt it includes a 1200 watt

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.050 
1200 watt it includes a 1200 watt
inverter<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.650> 60<00:00:29.010> amp<00:00:29.189> hours<00:00:29.490> these

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
inverter and it was 60 amp hours these

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
inverter and it was 60 amp hours these
are<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> batteries<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.720> were<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> there

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
are the batteries that were in it there

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
are the batteries that were in it there
are<00:00:32.250> 20<00:00:32.550> amp<00:00:32.759> hour<00:00:32.910> sealed<00:00:33.809> lead-acid

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
are 20 amp hour sealed lead-acid

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.549 
are 20 amp hour sealed lead-acid
batteries<00:00:34.739> three<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.000> total<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.559> tried

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
batteries three of them in total I tried

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
batteries three of them in total I tried
to<00:00:37.649> restore<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> use<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> no<00:00:39.329> Co<00:00:39.480> genius

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to restore to use with the no Co genius

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.700 
to restore to use with the no Co genius
it<00:00:39.960> didn't<00:00:40.170> work<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.590> were<00:00:40.770> completely<00:00:40.980> dry

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
it didn't work these were completely dry

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.729 
it didn't work these were completely dry
so<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:43.950> say<00:00:44.129> sealed<00:00:44.520> maintenance-free

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
so when they say sealed maintenance-free

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.569 
so when they say sealed maintenance-free
it<00:00:46.739> doesn't<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.219> mean<00:00:47.430> they're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it doesn't really mean they're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.410 
it doesn't really mean they're
maintenance-free<00:00:47.879> cuz<00:00:48.180> they're<00:00:48.300> gonna

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
maintenance-free cuz they're gonna

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
maintenance-free cuz they're gonna
eventually<00:00:48.899> evaporate<00:00:49.530> off<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> water<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
eventually evaporate off the water that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.770 
eventually evaporate off the water that
was<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:53.180> if<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.539> fill<00:00:54.690> them

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
was in them and if you don't fill them

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.090 
was in them and if you don't fill them
up<00:00:54.870> before<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:56.010> gonna

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
up before they do that then you're gonna

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
up before they do that then you're gonna
wreck<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.520> anyways<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.270> happened

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
wreck them anyways that's what happened

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
wreck them anyways that's what happened
these<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.930> old<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.070> dried<00:00:59.250> out<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.520> got

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
these are old and dried out so I got

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.960 
these are old and dried out so I got
this<00:01:03.210> box<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.629> use<00:01:03.809> pi4<00:01:04.350> 30<00:01:04.500> bucks<00:01:04.970> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this box off use pi4 30 bucks the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.140 
this box off use pi4 30 bucks the
batteries<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.390> dead<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:08.030> what<00:01:09.030> was

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
batteries are dead that's one what was

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
batteries are dead that's one what was
worth<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> me<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> 1200<00:01:10.650> watt

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
worth it to me was the 1200 watt

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
worth it to me was the 1200 watt
inverter<00:01:12.439> in<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.939> if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> Canadian

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
inverter in it if you go to a Canadian

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.499 
inverter in it if you go to a Canadian
Tire<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> try<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.700> spend<00:01:17.700> 30<00:01:17.880> bucks<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.299> get

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
Tire and try and spend 30 bucks to get

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.640 
Tire and try and spend 30 bucks to get
an<00:01:18.630> inverter<00:01:18.900> you'll<00:01:19.080> probably<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
an inverter you'll probably get about a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.760 
an inverter you'll probably get about a
75<00:01:20.130> watt<00:01:20.460> inverter<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> 1200<00:01:22.710> watt

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
75 watt inverter so a 1200 watt

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.289 
75 watt inverter so a 1200 watt
and<00:01:24.159> hurt<00:01:24.430> her<00:01:24.580> with<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.470> boost<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
and hurt her with with a boost or a

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.210 
and hurt her with with a boost or a
temporary<00:01:32.460> wattage<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:34.979> 2004<00:01:35.979> with<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
temporary wattage of 2004 with the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.359 
temporary wattage of 2004 with the
terminus<00:01:36.400> with<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.780> initial<00:01:38.530> load<00:01:38.979> for<00:01:39.340> a

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
terminus with a the initial load for a

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.430 
terminus with a the initial load for a
second<00:01:39.790> or<00:01:39.880> whatever<00:01:40.150> it'll<00:01:40.360> it'll<00:01:40.690> last<00:01:41.050> you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
second or whatever it'll it'll last you

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.300 
second or whatever it'll it'll last you
know<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.909> up<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.240> 2,000<00:01:43.960> watts<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:45.130> things

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
know go up to 2,000 watts for things

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.590 
know go up to 2,000 watts for things
like<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.490> water<00:01:45.759> pump<00:01:46.000> for<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.450> will

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
like a water pump for some so this will

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.469 
like a water pump for some so this will
run<00:01:46.720> our<00:01:46.869> water<00:01:47.080> pump<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.880> barely<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
run our water pump just barely but it

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.530 
run our water pump just barely but it
will<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:50.050> should<00:01:50.259> anyways<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.090> yeah<00:01:52.330> it's<00:01:52.479> a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
will it should anyways so yeah it's a

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.420 
will it should anyways so yeah it's a
box<00:01:52.750> with<00:01:53.080> batteries<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:53.800> my<00:01:53.920> old<00:01:54.070> lawn

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
box with batteries in I have my old lawn

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.550 
box with batteries in I have my old lawn
tractor<00:01:54.759> battery<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.210> which<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.690> a

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
tractor battery in it which is just a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.650 
tractor battery in it which is just a
wet<00:01:57.280> cell<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.640> not<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.820> deep<00:01:58.030> cycle<00:01:58.420> at<00:01:58.509> all

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
wet cell it's not a deep cycle at all

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.130 
wet cell it's not a deep cycle at all
but<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.440> just<00:01:59.500> use<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.920> for<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.690> shed<00:02:01.929> it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
but I just use it for in the shed it's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.719 
but I just use it for in the shed it's
gonna<00:02:02.289> die<00:02:02.590> soon<00:02:02.920> I'm<00:02:03.070> sure<00:02:03.250> because<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.610> not

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
gonna die soon I'm sure because it's not

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.650 
gonna die soon I'm sure because it's not
meant<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.690> sort<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> use<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.479> side

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
hours worth of power so what I'm going

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.090 
hours worth of power so what I'm going
to<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.360> I'm<00:02:55.420> gonna<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> deep<00:02:56.829> cell

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to do is I'm gonna get a deep cell

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.810
