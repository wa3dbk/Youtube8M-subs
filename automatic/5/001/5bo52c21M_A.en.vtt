00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
separate channels which I think that's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.130 
separate channels which I think that's
some<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.409> amazing<00:01:55.710> ideas<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.420> but

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
some really amazing ideas just do it but

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.459 
some really amazing ideas just do it but
do<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> together<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> feature<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
do it together and do this feature and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.440 
do it together and do this feature and
they<00:02:01.469> spotlight<00:02:02.340> booktubers<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> are

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
they spotlight booktubers that are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
they spotlight booktubers that are
fairly<00:02:03.750> new<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> community<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.950> think

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
fairly new to the community I think

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
fairly new to the community I think
whether<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.299> days<00:02:06.540> old<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.110> months<00:02:07.350> old<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
whether it's days old or months old I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.260 
whether it's days old or months old I
think<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.369> where<00:02:08.759> they're<00:02:08.970> headed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
think that's where they're headed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
think that's where they're headed
towards<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
towards and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
towards and
talking<00:02:11.220> about<00:02:11.400> people<00:02:11.730> who<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.720> have

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
talking about people who just have

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.539 
talking about people who just have
really<00:02:13.049> something<00:02:13.439> to<00:02:13.560> offer<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.069> community

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
really something to offer the community

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.500 
really something to offer the community
as<00:02:15.540> far<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:16.370> conversation<00:02:17.370> goes<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.909> believe

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
as far as conversation goes I believe

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.929 
as far as conversation goes I believe
that's<00:02:18.689> kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> how<00:02:19.409> their<00:02:19.709> that's<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.879> of

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
that's kind of how their that's kind of

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.910 
that's kind of how their that's kind of
like<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> common<00:02:21.480> theme<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.959> thought<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.500> when

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
like the common theme I thought of when

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
watching their videos and I think that's

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.729 
watching their videos and I think that's
really<00:02:24.420> awesome<00:02:24.750> thing<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:25.500> just
