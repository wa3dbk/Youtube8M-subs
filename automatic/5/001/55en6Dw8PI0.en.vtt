on<00:01:47.490> when<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.909> road

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.150 

okay<00:01:53.810> now<00:01:54.080> we're<00:01:54.260> here<00:01:54.440> in<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> hills<00:01:54.860> outside

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
okay now we're here in the hills outside

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.100 
okay now we're here in the hills outside
of<00:01:55.610> Madrid<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.150> got<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> chance<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.690> test<00:01:56.990> the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
of Madrid and got a chance to test the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.050 
of Madrid and got a chance to test the
handling<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.620> bit<00:01:57.770> more<00:01:57.980> although<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.940> new

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
handling a bit more although the new

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.030 
handling a bit more although the new
cache<00:01:59.300> guy<00:01:59.480> keeps<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.960> full<00:02:00.140> before<00:02:00.500> styling

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
cache guy keeps the full before styling

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.470 
cache guy keeps the full before styling
that<00:02:01.160> made<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:01.550> popular<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:02.030> first<00:02:02.270> time

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
that made it so popular the first time

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480 
that made it so popular the first time
around<00:02:02.780> with<00:02:02.960> plastic<00:02:03.710> cladding<00:02:03.980> and<00:02:04.280> roof

beam rear axle instead of the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.770

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
complicated multi-link suspension that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.870 
complicated multi-link suspension that
you<00:02:14.900> got<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> old<00:02:15.410> car<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.430> reason<00:02:16.760> for

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you got on the old car the reason for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.280 
you got on the old car the reason for
that<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.270> saves<00:02:17.540> them<00:02:17.690> an<00:02:17.780> awful<00:02:17.960> lot<00:02:18.260> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that is it saves them an awful lot of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
that is it saves them an awful lot of
weigh<00:02:18.500> about<00:02:18.680> 35<00:02:19.190> kilos<00:02:19.820> they<00:02:19.970> told<00:02:20.150> me<00:02:20.300> last

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
weigh about 35 kilos they told me last

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030 
weigh about 35 kilos they told me last
night<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.230> means<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.500> they<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.830> cut

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
night and that means that they can cut

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.640 
night and that means that they can cut
the<00:02:22.130> co2<00:02:22.430> emissions<00:02:22.940> really<00:02:23.240> easily<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.260> to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the co2 emissions really easily but to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.200 
the co2 emissions really easily but to
compensate<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.610> make<00:02:25.730> sure<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.000> still

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
compensate and to make sure it still

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.850 
compensate and to make sure it still
handles<00:02:26.660> really<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.050> they're<00:02:27.500> done<00:02:27.650> quite<00:02:27.830> a

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
handles really well they're done quite a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040 
handles really well they're done quite a
few<00:02:27.950> things<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.370> tweak<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.880> chassis<00:02:29.270> there's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
few things to tweak the chassis there's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.930 
few things to tweak the chassis there's
a<00:02:30.170> double<00:02:30.470> piston<00:02:30.680> shock<00:02:31.190> absorbers<00:02:31.730> on<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
a double piston shock absorbers on the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.880 
a double piston shock absorbers on the
back<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.780> helps<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.170> absorb<00:02:33.500> bumps<00:02:33.680> at

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
back and that helps it absorb bumps at

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.920 
back and that helps it absorb bumps at
low<00:02:34.070> speed<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.580> also<00:02:34.610> maintain<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> really

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
low speed but also maintain a really

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720 
low speed but also maintain a really
nice<00:02:36.170> firm<00:02:36.680> ride<00:02:37.040> for<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:37.550> going

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
nice firm ride for when you're going

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.250 
nice firm ride for when you're going
around<00:02:37.850> corners<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.480> doesn't<00:02:38.750> roll<00:02:39.020> too

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
around corners so it doesn't roll too

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.350 
around corners so it doesn't roll too
much<00:02:39.470> they've<00:02:40.280> also<00:02:40.490> got<00:02:40.760> two<00:02:41.030> different

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
much they've also got two different

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.870 
much they've also got two different
active<00:02:41.990> systems<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.220> first<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.700> is

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
active systems the first of that is

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.940 
active systems the first of that is
called<00:02:44.120> active<00:02:44.570> trace<00:02:44.960> control<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.800> that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
called active trace control and that's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.410 
called active trace control and that's
just<00:02:46.190> basically<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.700> fancy<00:02:47.090> way<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.270> saying

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
just basically a fancy way of saying

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.600 
just basically a fancy way of saying
torque<00:02:48.050> vectoring<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.160> when<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.370> pile

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
torque vectoring so that when you pile

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.850 
torque vectoring so that when you pile
really<00:02:50.030> hard<00:02:50.240> into<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.540> corner<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.140> stop<00:02:51.740> it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
really hard into a corner to stop it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.560 
really hard into a corner to stop it
under<00:02:52.070> steering<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.670> car<00:02:52.850> will<00:02:53.000> break<00:02:53.300> one<00:02:53.510> of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
under steering the car will break one of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.060 
under steering the car will break one of
the<00:02:53.720> inside<00:02:54.110> wheels<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.770> helps

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the inside wheels and that helps

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.650 
the inside wheels and that helps
slingshot<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.820> round<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.390> out<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> other

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
slingshot you round and out the other

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.350 
slingshot you round and out the other
side<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.920> second<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.430> called<00:02:58.489> ride<00:02:58.940> control

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
side the second is called ride control

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.280 
side the second is called ride control
that's<00:02:59.900> standard<00:03:00.890> on<00:03:01.010> all<00:03:01.220> new<00:03:01.459> cash<00:03:01.700> guys<00:03:01.940> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
that's standard on all new cash guys and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.410 
that's standard on all new cash guys and
it<00:03:03.290> works<00:03:03.560> by<00:03:03.920> braking<00:03:04.610> either<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.030> front<00:03:05.239> or

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
it works by braking either the front or

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.120 
it works by braking either the front or
the<00:03:05.540> rear<00:03:05.570> axle<00:03:06.110> when<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.290> go<00:03:06.440> over<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> bump<00:03:06.890> or

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
the rear axle when you go over a bump or

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.979 
the rear axle when you go over a bump or
even<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> pothole<00:03:08.330> something<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:08.810> that

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
even the pothole something like that

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.720 
even the pothole something like that
anything<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.709> moves<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.190> body<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.640> down

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
anything that moves the body up and down

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.030 
anything that moves the body up and down
the<00:03:11.360> brakes<00:03:11.630> just<00:03:11.810> apply<00:03:12.140> really<00:03:12.440> gently<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
the brakes just apply really gently and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.620 
the brakes just apply really gently and
that's<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.340> flatten<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.970> ride<00:03:14.180> as<00:03:14.420> soon

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
that's to flatten out the ride as soon

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.240 
that's to flatten out the ride as soon
as<00:03:14.750> possible<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.440> stop<00:03:15.680> you're<00:03:15.800> dipping<00:03:16.010> up

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
as possible and stop you're dipping up

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.220 
as possible and stop you're dipping up
and<00:03:16.430> down<00:03:16.610> it's<00:03:17.270> very<00:03:17.480> subtle<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> way<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
and down it's very subtle the way the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.050 
and down it's very subtle the way the
system<00:03:18.530> works<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.130> overall<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.760> means<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
system works but overall it means the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.430 
system works but overall it means the
cash<00:03:20.209> cow<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.140> comfortable

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
and quite refined it does feel a little

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.390 
and quite refined it does feel a little
grown-up<00:03:23.720> though<00:03:24.260> probably<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:25.340> a

grown-up though probably think it's a

grown-up though probably think it's a
little<00:03:25.670> bit<00:03:25.820> less<00:03:26.000> fun<00:03:26.269> than<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.540> was<00:03:26.660> before
