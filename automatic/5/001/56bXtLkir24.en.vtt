00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.630
 I do not know by 91 years I hope that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 you're doing a lot of other things from his 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.020
 turn a new video on the channel 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 a new review the middle review 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.419
 French court of the juventus 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 tURIN 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.660
 paul pogba version team of the season 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.489
 the monster because at its level 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 stats it's monstrous and even thousandth 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 it's monstrous you have that if the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.469
 small centers to scroll I had you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.149
 so to pause hoarau meters in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.950
 back bottom observe them at the level of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.360
 the team I decided to stall it in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 a team really very very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.380
 competitive with zlatan tos glass 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.890
 at it is a team that really does 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.450
 a lot of havoc online so le paul 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.220
 pogba will start by talking about his 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.960
 price range he mows is price 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.250
 really given the quality of the genre I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.750
 find that it is accessible anyway 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 so between 600 thousand nine hundred and fifty 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 thousand credit on xbox between 950 thousand and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.799
 a million 590 me credit on playstation 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.649
 so as usual it's more expensive on 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.090
 playstation but frankly when you 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.430
 see the price of some toth 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 he is one of the monsters so I 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.229
 think it's okay it stays 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 okay when you fight I do not know by 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.430
 report 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.770
 an ibra to suarez even if one 96.2 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
 general their price is really great 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.930
 high while the beautiful late period and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 its limits its limits nothing at all to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.070
 side of these players there and yet he 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.150
 is just as monstrous so 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.300
 now we will go into the points 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.040
 positive as with the 0 point ibrahim 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.710
 negative in this player review 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.910
 really ultra complete it's not a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.290
 negative but the kicks 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.490
 stopped at the poc poc medium drinks 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.500
 here I tried some free kicks 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 he has a correct stat in 1.74 after 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 his free kick but I absolutely not 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.080
 managed to pull them 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.910
 so I did not put in the most 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.220
 nor in the east less but that's when 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.680
 even I still like it 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 so specify the paul pogba talk about 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.649
 wrists positive points earlier 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 so at the level of the positive points the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.369
 pass quality a very very good 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.470
 quality passes 90 we pass on the map 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.400
 although it's true that as 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.380
 offensive midfielder I was expecting when 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.940
 even to score a lot more to do 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.010
 many more assists than that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.030
 the customers did not do a lot 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.190
 I especially scored a lot of goals 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.959
 with him by the way it did not hurt me 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 surprised because he still has 81 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.290
 years so finishing the way between new 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.459
 and hits at the level of the strikes it's 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.280
 in the proposals obviously I 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.560
 put everything 81 in finish for a medium 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 offensive is really more than correct 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.360
 it remains a very very good marker the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.620
 most goals I think of any 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.530
 way to notice it in this review 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 it's starting in pivot in fact in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.489
 repair surface you turn around 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 with the employment pole and you hit it's 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.569
 almost every time the same goals 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.370
 and in that role he really does 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.780
 difference thanks also to his physique at 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.970
 level of striking so at the finish 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.080
 81 in finish the long shot I have 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.340
 need to make it clear that this is 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.599
 absolutely anything you go 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.560
 see the last clip of this road we 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.440
 and it's a new demented shock of which 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.600
 99,109 99 as strike power 91 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.030
 flew with 1.81 finish that remains a 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.900
 very very big hitter at his level 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.069
 physical a guy 86 97 in strength 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.330
 90 in agility 94 jumping in this area 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.880
 for nothing and takes almost every 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.430
 balloons head in it's really very 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.450
 very impressive and at the level of his 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.860
 physical his intentions 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.810
 this is a time that it is almost 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.580
 impossible to move the old stats in 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.690
 balance a bit like the free to mesa 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.760
 generally it's the genres with a 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.709
 big the big players with the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.870
 force usually they have stats in 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.370
 balance in the game and here's what 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 it's simply 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.690
 it's just a nice devil at 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.920
 level of his star in strength he is huge 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.570
 we already classified the last clip of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.620
 this review the long shot of which I you 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.079
 I talked a long time ago that I had 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.670
 not very long shot as dirty after the 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.769
 4 stars technical gestures obviously 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.090
 96 in dribbling m with 4 stars 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.500
 technical gesture it has the advantage of having 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.590
 the four bad foot star too 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.000
 went sideways defensively I'm going 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.500
 talk about it because that with me I 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.609
 played in an offensive role because 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.430
 for me paul pogba it's a medium 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.019
 offensive in the game I did not see the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.609
 put in as a relay runner because 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.709
 that for me it would have been restrained being 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.510
 given that he has huge stats hitting 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.530
 is on the way I did not want to put it a 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.200
 post more distant 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850
 even if the stadium demo in defense I'm 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.750
 say it's a mess paul pogba for 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.410
 I'm really an offensive player 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.750
 in the game 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.040
 and besides it's statins games make 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.880
 from him I believe that's where he is 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.990
 really the best sense as long as 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.690
 attacking midfielder and in a hurry and I thought 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.390
 at 94 or 95 a game of stats 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.860
 So it's for me here it is 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.540
 that it must be leveled 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.010
 so sestak in defense I have not 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.180
 spoken but it is really ultra complete 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.760
 for people who will want to put it 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.600
 in a rather defensive role 80 in 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.150
 97 years interception mud tackle 92 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.240
 tackles announced 92 a tackle of taste of 97 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.190
 years slipped tackle 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.080
 this is simply a demon 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.520
 so there is the balance sheet that is displayed 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.590
 for several seconds and the moon in 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.280
 from paul pogba toth so at the level of 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.230
 positive pros 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.820
 the game vision I did not talk about it but 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.750
 a very good vision you allow 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.370
 to make the flap of beautiful openings 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.180
 even though it's true that like raining 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.900
 I made only one decisive pass 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.130
 with long striking hot flap finish 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.440
 you can really hit in any 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.460
 which sense with him his speed 85 in 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.750
 speed on the map 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.700
 once it's launched it's very 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.230
 difficult to take back defensively 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.450
 I just talked about tackle slipped tackle 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.920
 of taste interceptions he has the stats 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.660
 for those who will want to do it 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.980
 to play lower even if I tell you 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.110
 do not recommend I think it's not 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.190
 really the best of the solutions and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.090
 his bullet points are huge 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.300
 physical 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.920
 a handsome devil an aggression tank game 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.180
 of head in the air realm it is 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.610
 very very very very good positioning 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.840
 very easy to find and what is 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.950
 well with the paul pogba in fact it was 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.960
 as he has an offensive contribution 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.160
 strong against if you play it in 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.330
 as an offensive midfielder 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.370
 he'll stay in front of here he'll stay 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.110
 before there will be no y 'will not to 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.210
 kind it will go down too much 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.770
 that no he remains in front of his quality of 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.600
 pass the four stars gestures 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.430
 techniques and the four bad stars 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.560
 foot so you see the record with the 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.420
 pole must see seven matches 14 goals and 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.830
 one decisive pass 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.480
 the only side where I was really disappointed 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.620
 it's at the level of French passes 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.580
 to do a lot more besides I have 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.380
 hungry that's why I put 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.420
 besides vibrato and lacazette 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.400
 with him players who plant a lot 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.280
 in this game and unfortunately I have 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.900
 failed to exploit this is 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.610
 by the way again on the seven 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.700
 matches I have not finished them all 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.890
 like yavé ibra toth in the low team 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.020
 ariège leave fairly quickly again 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.490
 once so stéphane 24th 20h for 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.750

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.010
