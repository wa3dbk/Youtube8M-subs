00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.319
 we make the obligatory stop playstation 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 with my being 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.980
 jaime casting coasts men I'm very 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.929
 happy as always is a pleasure 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.240
 have them here to you and be with 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.940
 all of our players in the show like 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.130
 you know and that is an event we are 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.170
 pushing the whole industry so that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.330
 obviously we can bring all the 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.070
 players in the best of videogames and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.130
 the best content I think is a 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.260
 project where we are all focusing 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.950
 our efforts for the industry 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.500
 grow clear and you see the truth reflected 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.200
 in this stand as common happens without 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.810
 gigantic era it was very cool but this 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.580
 time is even more than you can 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.800
 talk about the new games they bring 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.960
 now exhibiting will return just like 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.790
 are you for the point you're going 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.640
 I can complement in two ways the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.890
 first is to be right we are 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 striving hard to bring a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 experience very similar to what the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.560
 players can see in e3 but we know 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.870
 that many of them do not have the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.130
 opportunity to attend year after year by 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.629
 there we also know that it is not an event 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.490
 properly open to the consumer 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.330
 then in playstation we are 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.070
 striving 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.920
 so that the experience is the most 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.480
 similarly possible and in that sense in the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.420
 part of the content we have also done 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.180
 important efforts we want your 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.640
 visit is not only for them to play 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.560
 but also play exclusive in 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
 the particular cases that I can 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.120
 comment is that we have order that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 well it has some spectacular rows and 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.960
 not only can you already have the hanson 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.910
 but it is also themed with a 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.040
 london victorian so you feel 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.780
 presidents inside the game we have a 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.060
 vote for iun and inconsiderate hat for 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.530
 that brings you that memory and also that 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.630
 have the hanson and experience 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 complete of a title extremely 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.290
 innovative with visuals 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.720
 spectacular and that is developed 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.280
 by viriato and published by santa monica 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.190
 studios no more and no less than 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.200
 choir word creators on the other hand 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.369
 we also have blackburn bolton is a t 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.900
 it's not a very visual game is 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.690
 spectacular in terms of the treatment of 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.820
 the graphs and it's obviously like the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.830
 name says it quite bloody this 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.650
 it's for all our players that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 they like that action and be fighting 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.280
 with monsters 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.750
 an obligatory title is a stop that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.849
 has several play stations for 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.620
 make a hands on already with a demo 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.060
 quite advanced and similar to what 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.150
 you can enjoy at the beginning of 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.680
 2015 but not everything is focused on the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.629
 players who are super hardcore too 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.700
 we have for all types of audiences a 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.829
 little for those who like those 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.360
 Friendly competitions between friends and 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.909
 for example we have drive what is a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.650
 title that is released on October 7th 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.049
 I recommend that you make your pre purchase today 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.390
 in game planet and you can take a 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.849
 collection cap that will only be 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.549
 available for game planet here in this 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.859
 in this event and also have access to 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.810
 the extra cars for the pre purchase but 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.540
 we have white club and we have for example 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.250
 for the most familiar public we have 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 books the planet 3 which is one of the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.510
 playstation banners in this 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 Sackboy occasion does not come alone can you 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.840
 find on the bus to be taken 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.780
 the photo but it is also accompanied by 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.129
 his friends from out soft solÃ­s who 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.450
 They have different functions for 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.940
 enrich the gaming experience 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.319
 and I think you can talk about that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.150
 It is also a game that is as it is 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 quite expected for all those 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.170
 who like how terror looks at a gift 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.170
 personally it is one of my favorites 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.970
 is to see I'm going to invite you to better what 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.130
 try because it's an exclusive that 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.810
 we fight hard to have it and we are 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.180
 proud that I'm here for the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.239
 Mexican market but I can give you a 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.950
 advance that practically treats as 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.799
 one of those summer movies where 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.269
 the friends go to a cabin a group 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.970
 of friends is in a cabin and they start 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.890
 to happen half creepy elements and of 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.530
 soon there they are running for their life 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.060
 is very well developed if they are going to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.980
 apply one another time then you 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.720
 I recommend that you try it very many 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.739
 thanks the truth is that we are going to give 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.390
 another role because we do not get hurt 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.730
 keep playing in the games over and over 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.319
