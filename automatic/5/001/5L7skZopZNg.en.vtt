with a shot and I kind of just freaked
out<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.030> adrenaline<00:02:54.900> stuff

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
out and I think that adrenaline stuff

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.210 
out and I think that adrenaline stuff
just<00:02:55.349> took<00:02:55.470> all<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.650> wind<00:02:55.860> out<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.010> me<00:02:56.130> you
