00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 centuries in response to culinary needs 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.379
 rapidly changing society 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.449
 industrialization left people with everything 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.970
 less time on cooking and 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.129
 also on its use after a hundred years 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.290
 little has changed homemade food 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.399
 most prefer fast food 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.670

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.450
 for the sport that's not American food 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.250
 tasty but sticking to healthy food 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.569
 if the hamburger is decomposed into ingredients 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.649
 then get the same healthy yes 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.780
 very meat bread 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.390
 I love him very much always no 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 well, it is very visible 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.230
 and the taste of 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.470
 they are tasty for me not tasty 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.380
 no mom not allowed very much 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 Russian fine dishes that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.830
 supplement the variety of Russian cuisine 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.540
 which you can actually eat for those 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.070
 same money get the same amount 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.110
 calories and carbohydrates there and so on 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.300
 so actually American yes to us in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.000
 principle does not need to have an opinion that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.640
 fast food is so chemical and harmful 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 food that I did not even survive the germs but 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 Is this the price ? Quality decided to hold 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
 test purchase we drove around 5 points 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.060
 catering Vladivostok 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.840
 the first point of the test was a pit stop 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.670
 snack time 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.890
 what's at the alliance refueling at the cape then 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.530
 caribbean next stop was 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.960
 magic burger is the very first American 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.630
 diner Vladivostok here a hamburger 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.180
 costs 65 rubles royal burger 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.980
 chain of fast food restaurants 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.400
 appreciated his muffin bun at 57 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.620
 rubles 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.870
 then we went to the avenue of beauty 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.600
 where they bought the hamburger of the Stroganov company 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.240
 for 140 rubles and the network has become the fifth point 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.970
 fast food cafe buba 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.770
 relatively recently all the samples you 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 taken to a test center in 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.459
 within the hour received the following 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.350
 results and microbiological 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.290
 research wisdom analgin and all 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.910
 performance is normal it passes by 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.690
 microbiological indicators 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.430
 sample number two is revealed 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.770
 mismatch 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.170
 by microbiological indicators it 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.230
 total microbial number of bacteria group 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.430
 E. coli and golden 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.550
 staph and I pass by 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.470
 microbiology 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.520
 This is due to non- compliance with sanitary 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.920
 conditions 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.590
 both in production and in progress 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.290
 selling or transporting itself 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.720
 products either directly at 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.970
 selling this product sample 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.690
 number three 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.209
 passes by all indicators 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.930
 match pattern number four 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.359
 does not correspond also in general not 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.450
 intestinal bacteria 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.050
 sticks 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.620
 and Staphylococcus aureus is due this 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.180
 again with a violation of sanitary 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 conditions at work or at 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.250
 implementation itself directly 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.160
 product sales points sample number 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.730
 five allocated bacteria of the intestinal group 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.390
 sticks on the 5th floor due to the fact that 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.910
 were broken 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.599
 the center layer may be in place 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.940
 sales 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.769
 coliform bacteria and 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.060
 Staphylococcus aureus are 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.700
 opportunistic 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.320
 and have any person in the Russian 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.820
 federation document that is rationed 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.740
 value of acceptable data level 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.010
 indicators are normalized uniform 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.100
 sanitary and epidemiological 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.460
 and genius clinics product subject 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.139
 sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.720
 control in the Russian Federation and if 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.870
 This indicator goes beyond 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.560
 acceptable level then may cause 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.419
 human various toxicoinfections 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.250
 which can lead up to 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.750
 death and be an idiot 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.150
 do you want when you eat a hamburger 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.220
 but not only non-compliance 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.620
 conditions can lead you straight to 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.600
 resuscitation is still Russian catering 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.610
 whom we are somehow not used to trust 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.729
 can we be sure that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.110
 the composition of meat cutlets of proper quality 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.120
 right first manufacturer 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.979
 Traditionally tries to cheapen the product 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.940
 secondly, it does not always comply with the conditions 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.360
 storage 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.780
 there is another factor if these burgers 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.560
 fried in margarine in which in which 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.720
 are present 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.770
 splashes if this oil was used 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.810
 vegetable oil but was used 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.479
 also many times during the day too when 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.340
 accumulate harmful substances that 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.010
 as well as 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.830
 spends on carcinogens 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.810
 accumulate our organs tissues and 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.169
 cause the development of oncology we finally 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.229
 this big white bun is perfect 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.870
 empty carbohydrates are easily digestible if you 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.500
 they have not been spent immediately very intensively 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:04.240
 memes are deposited where undesirable in 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.140
 he said and try the salad at home with 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.330
 pork 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.430
 I thank you, I generally tie for the figures 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.130
 worry we look at me i 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.200
 every day I eat hamburger here 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.810
 absolutes hurt mind and hilary knots alright 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.210
 persuaded let's change hamburger oh 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:30.400
 great you ca n't anyway 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.860
 stop eating fast food 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.020
 I advise you to cook it at home 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.120
 paradoxically it sounded like that 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.490
 be sure of its contents but not 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.660
 forget to eat in a hamburger and squirrels and 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.460
 fats and carbohydrates 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.470
 and in one serving about two hundred 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.550
 fifty five kilocalories and this 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.550
 full lunch
