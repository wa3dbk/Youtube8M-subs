Mega Man games on the Nintendo and
that's<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.869> darking<00:01:40.350> dog<00:01:40.530> basically

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that's because darking dog basically

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.700 
that's because darking dog basically
uses<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> same<00:01:41.759> type<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> engine<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> Mega

of<00:01:45.329> different<00:01:45.659> weapons<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> graphics<00:01:46.860> are

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
of different weapons if the graphics are

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.069 
of different weapons if the graphics are
almost<00:01:47.520> identical<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> Mega<00:01:48.600> Man<00:01:48.689> games

and the actual moving around physics are

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.590 
and the actual moving around physics are
very<00:01:51.960> Mega<00:01:52.740> Man<00:01:53.040> ish<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.240> though<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
very Mega Man ish I would say though the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
very Mega Man ish I would say though the
darkling<00:01:54.930> duck<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> probably<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.740> casual

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
darkling duck is probably a more casual

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
darkling duck is probably a more casual
version<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.180> Mega<00:01:57.450> Man<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.350> hard<00:01:58.590> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
version of Mega Man it's not as hard as

version of Mega Man it's not as hard as
some<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> Megaman<00:01:59.520> levels<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.180> that's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
some of the Megaman levels and that's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.139 
some of the Megaman levels and that's
not<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> say<00:02:01.200> darkwing<00:02:01.680> duck<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.640> easiest
