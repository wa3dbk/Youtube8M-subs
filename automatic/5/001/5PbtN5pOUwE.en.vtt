00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.979 
going to try and patch it with a new
firmware<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.440> i<00:00:52.710> thought<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.690> time

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
firmware now i thought it's about time

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
firmware now i thought it's about time

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
bit outdated so I thought it was time

your<00:01:03.780> blobs<00:01:04.140> saved<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.979> actually

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
your blobs saved so you can actually

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.000 
your blobs saved so you can actually
jailbreak<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> future<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> sh

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
jailbreak in the future now what is sh

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
jailbreak in the future now what is sh
sh<00:01:08.400> blogs<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> might<00:01:08.970> ask<00:01:09.119> basically<00:01:10.080> these

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sh blogs you might ask basically these

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
sh blogs you might ask basically these
are<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.950> files<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.750> will

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
are just the little files that you will

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710 
are just the little files that you will
save<00:01:13.170> meaning<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.729> Apple<00:01:15.180> were<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> patch

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
save meaning that if Apple were to patch

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
save meaning that if Apple were to patch
and<00:01:15.900> exploit<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.159> no<00:01:17.369> longer

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
and exploit and then there was no longer

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
and exploit and then there was no longer
a<00:01:17.790> jailbreak<00:01:18.439> available<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> new

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

those<00:01:26.220> blobs<00:01:26.549> saved<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:29.220> apple

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
those blobs saved now because apple

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
those blobs saved now because apple
update<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> firmware<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.110> no<00:01:31.259> longer

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
update the firmware they will no longer

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.100 
update the firmware they will no longer
sign<00:01:31.860> any<00:01:32.100> firmwares<00:01:32.670> underneath<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.750> latest
