hey Curtis Marshall this this bag is a
seven<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.710> half<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:11.190> 12<00:00:11.519> which<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.299> know<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
seven and a half like 12 which I know is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:40.279 
seven and a half like 12 which I know is
what<00:00:13.469> three<00:00:14.099> chambers<00:00:14.519> pretty<00:00:14.790> well<00:00:25.520> too<00:00:39.289> big

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
what three chambers pretty well too big

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.819 
what three chambers pretty well too big
I<00:00:40.530> wanted<00:00:41.039> to<00:00:41.629> what<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> smaller<00:00:43.199> one<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.679> they

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I wanted to what a smaller one but they

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
I wanted to what a smaller one but they
told<00:00:44.100> me<00:00:45.199> then<00:00:46.199> I<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.559> wait<00:00:47.960> it's<00:00:48.960> quite<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
told me then I have to wait it's quite a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.290 
told me then I have to wait it's quite a
long<00:00:49.499> time<00:00:49.879> from<00:00:50.879> China<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.030> opted<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
long time from China so I opted for a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.669 
long time from China so I opted for a
bigger<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.050> gave<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.409> same

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
bigger one and they gave me the same

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.149 
bigger one and they gave me the same
cost<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.489> smaller<00:00:56.879> cost<00:00:59.449> careful<00:01:00.769> so<00:01:01.769> the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
cost as the smaller cost careful so the

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.750 
cost as the smaller cost careful so the
water<00:01:02.399> doesn't<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:02.850> come<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.760> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
water doesn't actually come out but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
water doesn't actually come out but
anyways<00:01:06.120> I<00:01:06.330> put<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.840> cutting<00:01:07.770> block<00:01:07.980> here

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
anyways I put this cutting block here

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
anyways I put this cutting block here
because<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> provides<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.260> height<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
because it provides some height here and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
because it provides some height here and
it<00:01:11.340> makes<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.730> bagel<00:01:12.150> easier<00:01:12.480> sometimes<00:01:12.690> I<00:01:12.900> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it makes a bagel easier sometimes I just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.800 
it makes a bagel easier sometimes I just
drag<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.440> bag<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.980> cutting<00:01:14.280> board<00:01:14.810> kind

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
drag the bag on the cutting board kind

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.090 
drag the bag on the cutting board kind
of<00:01:15.900> push<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.530> air<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
of push some of the air out and this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.170 
of push some of the air out and this
seal<00:01:20.520> width<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.270> wider<00:01:21.780> than<00:01:22.370> what<00:01:23.370> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
seal width is a lot wider than what you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.070 
seal width is a lot wider than what you
line<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.540> somebody<00:01:24.900> usually<00:01:25.110> sells<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:30.080> thought

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
line or somebody usually sells I thought

line or somebody usually sells I thought
it's<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.590> helpful<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> dial<00:01:32.730> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it's really helpful you got a dial in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.770 
it's really helpful you got a dial in
how<00:01:33.030> much<00:01:33.800> actual<00:01:35.000> Celia<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.600> if

how much actual Celia need because if

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.320 
how much actual Celia need because if
you<00:01:36.870> don't<00:01:37.220> you'll<00:01:38.220> burn<00:01:38.400> through<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.700> bag<00:01:38.910> I

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
you don't you'll burn through the bag I

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.660 
you don't you'll burn through the bag I
don't<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.260> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.410> see<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.830> that's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
don't know if you can see that that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
don't know if you can see that that's
just<00:01:41.940> one<00:01:42.150> chamber<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> didn't<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.230> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
just one chamber I didn't do really that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.800 
just one chamber I didn't do really that
good<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> job<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.890> pushing<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> air<00:01:44.640> out

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
good a job of pushing the air out

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.910 
good a job of pushing the air out
there's<00:01:45.810> still<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.230> air<00:01:46.440> there<00:01:46.740> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
there's still a little bit air there but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.020 
there's still a little bit air there but
I<00:01:46.950> mean<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.190> not<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> end<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.670> world<00:01:47.850> all

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I mean it's not the end of the world all

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.230 
I mean it's not the end of the world all
right

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
right

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.990 
right
but<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.230> seals<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.550> good<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.940> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but that seals it's really good it's a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.020 
but that seals it's really good it's a
really<00:01:51.180> wide<00:01:51.450> seal<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.470> know

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
really wide seal you know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.130 
really wide seal you know
and<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.150> was<00:01:55.270> done<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.780> know<00:01:55.870> fairly

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and that was done you know fairly

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.110 
and that was done you know fairly
quickly<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.430> said<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.760> can<00:01:57.850> get<00:01:57.940> really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
quickly like I said you can get really

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.770 
quickly like I said you can get really
good<00:01:58.360> at<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.540> very<00:01:58.870> quick<00:01:59.760> again<00:02:00.760> tuck<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.690> in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
good at it very quick again tuck it in

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.360 
good at it very quick again tuck it in
there<00:02:02.460> fold<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.640> over<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.980> know<00:02:06.010> we<00:02:06.220> could

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
there fold it over you know we could

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.890 
there fold it over you know we could
drop<00:02:06.580> your<00:02:06.730> fishing<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.270> guess<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:10.119> water<00:02:10.390> I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
drop your fishing I guess the water I

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.880 
drop your fishing I guess the water I
would<00:02:11.770> see<00:02:11.950> why<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.220> paint<00:02:12.700> water<00:02:16.620> obviously<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
would see why is paint water obviously a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:28.830 
would see why is paint water obviously a
special<00:02:18.130> container<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.540> thought<00:02:28.720> was

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
special container this I thought was

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
special container this I thought was
really<00:02:28.990> important<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.560> dragging<00:02:30.070> motion<00:02:30.460> it

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
really important is dragging motion it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.270 
really important is dragging motion it
kind<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.790> gets<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> water<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:38.280> what's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
kind of gets the water in what's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:52.420 
kind of gets the water in what's
happened

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.009 

the<00:02:52.849> more<00:02:53.090> area<00:02:53.390> could<00:02:53.540> push<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
the more area could push out of the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.530 
the more area could push out of the
second<00:02:54.560> one<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.400> easier<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.000> third<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.420> has

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
second one the easier the third one has

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
second one the easier the third one has
to<00:02:56.720> do<00:02:56.840> because<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.379> more<00:02:57.560> room<00:02:59.470> in<00:03:00.470> this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
to do because you have more room in this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.339 
to do because you have more room in this
particular<00:03:01.190> one<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.599> cage<00:03:02.840> ran

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
particular one this is that cage ran

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.750 
particular one this is that cage ran
that<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.680> showed<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.160> new<00:03:04.310> line<00:03:04.519> there

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
that I showed you in a new line there

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.100 
that I showed you in a new line there
the<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.739> second<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.220> got<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.849> just<00:03:08.239> over<00:03:08.780> two

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
the the second I got it is just over two

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.320 
the the second I got it is just over two
it<00:03:09.560> goes<00:03:09.769> all<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:09.950> way<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.310> five<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.209> was

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
it goes all the way up to five so it was

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.750 
it goes all the way up to five so it was
hard<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:11.720> me<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.930> dial<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.470> where<00:03:13.280> exactly<00:03:13.519> to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
hard for me to dial in where exactly to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.690 
hard for me to dial in where exactly to
put<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.120> first<00:03:14.330> one<00:03:14.709> where<00:03:15.709> weird<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.489> dial

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
put that first one where weird to dial

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.670 
put that first one where weird to dial
it<00:03:16.849> into<00:03:17.090> because<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.420> was<00:03:17.540> burning<00:03:17.840> two<00:03:17.959> bags<00:03:18.200> I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it into because I was burning two bags I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680 
it into because I was burning two bags I
wasn't<00:03:19.220> getting<00:03:19.400> good<00:03:19.430> seals<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.420> over

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
wasn't getting good seals so just over

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.569 
wasn't getting good seals so just over
two<00:03:20.900> seems<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.349> perfect<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.920> third<00:03:25.250> one<00:03:25.489> is

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
two seems to be perfect the third one is

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.870 
two seems to be perfect the third one is
the<00:03:25.760> tricky<00:03:27.160> because<00:03:28.160> there's<00:03:28.459> not<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.640> lot<00:03:28.730> of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
the tricky because there's not a lot of

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.479 
the tricky because there's not a lot of
favor<00:03:29.299> in<00:03:29.630> here<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.110> once<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.650> you're<00:03:31.220> pouring

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
favor in here so once the you're pouring

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.039 
favor in here so once the you're pouring
the<00:03:31.610> water<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.060> wants<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.390> pull<00:03:32.630> over<00:03:32.780> in

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
the water and it wants to pull over in

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:46.479 
the water and it wants to pull over in
kind<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:34.060> release<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.590> honestly<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:46.099> don't<00:03:46.220> know

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
kind of release so honestly I don't know

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.619 
kind of release so honestly I don't know
if<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.670> even<00:03:46.849> want<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.299> third<00:03:47.569> one

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
if you even want to do a third one

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.140 
if you even want to do a third one
because<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:47.989> such<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> pain<00:03:48.410> in<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.560> ass<00:03:49.150> but

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
because it's such a pain in the ass but

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.030 
because it's such a pain in the ass but
if<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.690> want<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.049> get<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.260> most<00:03:51.410> out<00:03:51.590> your<00:03:51.650> bag

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.520 
if you want to get the most out your bag
I<00:03:52.549> think<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.390> your<00:03:53.510> true<00:03:53.810> lowest<00:03:54.170> cost<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.890> guess

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
I think it your true lowest cost I guess

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640 
I think it your true lowest cost I guess
I'm<00:03:57.530> sure<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.859> can<00:03:58.010> become<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.280> pro<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:59.650> just

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
I'm sure you can become a pro I just

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.830 
I'm sure you can become a pro I just
noticed<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.160> difficult<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.480> really<00:04:02.690> got<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
noticed this difficult you really got to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.809 
noticed this difficult you really got to
hold<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.290> together<00:04:03.709> give<00:04:04.220> us<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.340> tighter<00:04:04.609> grip

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
hold it together give us a tighter grip

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.910 
hold it together give us a tighter grip
as<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:06.230> hold<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.560> as<00:04:06.650> wide<00:04:06.889> as

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
as you can to hold it as wide as

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.629 
as you can to hold it as wide as
possible<00:04:07.100> because<00:04:07.760> if<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.690> don't<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:10.459> leave

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
possible because if you don't you leave

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.740 
possible because if you don't you leave
any<00:04:10.790> slack<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:12.410> bag<00:04:12.709> will<00:04:13.160> pour<00:04:14.120> out

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
any slack the bag will pour out

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.140 
any slack the bag will pour out

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
because it's a little still hot and if

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.590 
because it's a little still hot and if
you're<00:04:49.380> really<00:04:49.500> yank<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.009> it'll<00:04:50.600> it'll

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
stretch the plastic and it'll bust well

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.340 
stretch the plastic and it'll bust well

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
really good this one's kind of not good

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.140 
really good this one's kind of not good
so<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.130> got<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.310> really<00:05:29.460> put<00:05:29.729> some<00:05:29.759> pressure

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
so you got to really put some pressure

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.740 
so you got to really put some pressure
on<00:05:30.330> there<00:05:30.660> when<00:05:30.780> you're<00:05:30.900> swimming<00:05:31.080> as<00:05:31.320> well

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
on there when you're swimming as well

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.120 
on there when you're swimming as well
and<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:33.810> got<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.050> try<00:05:34.229> to<00:05:34.259> separate<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.039> as

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
and you got to try to separate it as

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.560 
and you got to try to separate it as
hard<00:05:35.400> as<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.669> can<00:05:35.880> because<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.300> don't<00:05:36.449> want

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
hard as you can because you don't want

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.629 
hard as you can because you don't want
these<00:05:36.720> wrinkles<00:05:37.320> obviously<00:05:38.310> you<00:05:38.370> don't<00:05:38.460> get

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
these wrinkles obviously you don't get

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.170 
these wrinkles obviously you don't get
as<00:05:38.759> good<00:05:38.789> a<00:05:38.970> seal<00:05:39.300> here<00:05:39.599> I<00:05:40.789> don't<00:05:41.789> think<00:05:42.000> it's

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
as good a seal here I don't think it's

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.000 
as good a seal here I don't think it's
gonna<00:05:42.300> come<00:05:42.539> up<00:05:42.630> dug<00:05:42.810> down<00:05:42.990> or<00:05:43.199> anything<00:05:43.349> this

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
as much pressure as possible anyways

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.430
