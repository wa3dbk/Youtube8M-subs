00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.240
 Below you will find a patented innovation from Germany 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.460
 presented the flexible technology + b 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.819
 which stands for energy and Biedermann the table must 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.930
 more with Norbert Becker is responsible for orthopedics 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 the biomechanics of flexible technology 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.870
 Feet are heavy workers 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.140
 With our feet, I literally stand for life and we walk 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.530
 with them through the Thunder 50 million steps that's four times around 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.100
 world 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.870
 Scientific studies prove that over 15 million Germans alone 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.860
 Joint complaints back and head complaints due to wrong 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.900
 Foot burdens in the wrong or in public schools 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.790
 the natural form of walking is barefoot running 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.310
 in a pressure of the tram one recognizes the pressure distribution of the foot during the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.280
 Walking barefoot high pressure 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.320
 at the shipping on Trickett 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.640
 and in the middle of the leg found imprint is normal and natural 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.220
 normal shoes have often been arched in the bathing area of ​​the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.799
 Foot adjusts to that he goes and then stands like in an alley 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.560
 another use of it written as well as its shape and needs up 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.220
 in extreme cases, then a hole in the brine in the middle of the pair that arises 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.890
 so-called still know 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 the school unstable and the foot unnaturally deformed the focus breaks 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 by 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 this results in a bad load to foot 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.200
 and, as a consequence, an incorrect loading of the whole body, the so-called medial 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.600
 instability 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.500
 With the flexible systems we have developed a solution to the problem 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.939
 gossamer if just some brine made of spring steel is longitudinal 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.800
 flexible 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040
 and stable in the transverse direction 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.370
 It absorbs all forces that deform and damage the foot 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.100
 can 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 on the Flexi TEXO Lab, the foot can roll four barefoot without the foot 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.649
 is deformed and the shoe wears off incorrectly 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.449
 in a normal to soft shoe and the basler of the foot adapts to the 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.379
 Underground collapses well and, of course, tilts 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.439
 The Flexi Texas stabilizes the forefoot and prevents the 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.099
 Foot deformed 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.049
 With the Flexi Texas themes, the shoe bottom is stable and yet remains 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.569
 flexible 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.260
 Windman a punctual load in a shoe Una fetzig DAX is even 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.219
 The shoe weighs at this point 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.189
 with the renunciation now the sole remains to give work and deforms 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.609
 not 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.319
 the lower the deformation Scotia and the more stable the shoe is 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.229
 Thus, the Flexity Xolar forms a treasure for the shoes and a 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.939
 optimal wearing surface for the foot 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.819
 The Flexity Xolair is made with high quality spring steel 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.429
 to choose oblique 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.749
 the direction of the waves is modeled on the anatomy of the foot and at 77 degrees 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.969
 shown on foot longitudinal axis 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.699
 in the heel area, she then supports a rolling process without the foot too 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.579
 to lift" 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 here is the world in the direction of 103 wire rack 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.939
 The Flexi Tech Data System stabilizes the shoe and supports the foot exactly 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.450
 This can be done very well on an X-ray image is the stand 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.880
 stable and safe 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.449
 because then it is stable and secure its stability is guaranteed 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.119
 the slipcase keeps its fit longer 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.819
 All elements such as cushioning come to Manta's management level in the shoe 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.179
 to better advantage 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.359
 and the school runs off as it should 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.839
 Thus, the functionality of the shoe is significantly expanded 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.229
 the Flexity Kplus the 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:51.919
 is primarily designed for schools with Loser insole and is under 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.070
 These are laid even with a very thin original insert 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.140
 the proficient which flexIT corner the usual wearing comfort 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.289
 that symbolize the bio magnetic component over an in 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.289
 the son integrated high-quality neodymium magnets 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.889
 Bush and physics Nobel laureate Professor Werner Heisenberg knew 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.709
 The magnetic energy is the elementary energy of the whole 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.400
 Life depends 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.199
 Our health is among other factors that may be significantly dependent 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.139
 torn by the nature of our death 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.139
 the blood circulation the undersupply of the entire organism 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.630
 with the vital oxygen and other important nutrients SVE the 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.850
 Removal of carbon dioxide and metabolic products 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:44.019
 the oxygen tent with the help of the red blood cells of the so-called something 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.710
 All over the Bundestag Love transported 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.160
 by some Gabon's potential, they can mutually support each other as well 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.699
 repel 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.770
 These tensions prevent the reduced from bleeding or being used as a place 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.889
 stick to the vessel walls 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.499
 a very important reason for the slowdown dispute 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.519
 The so-called money is supposed to be red blood cell formation 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.250
 the ten rows are clumped together like the youngest one 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.770
 b column together 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.699
 which leads to a reduction of their elasticity 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.490
 the consequence 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.169
 Circulatory disorders 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.960
 the education to acute and chronic impairment up to the 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.460
 Destruction of various kinds can lead to Felix functions 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.089
 this results in a wealth of diseases 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.380
 about his life two bands are crucially affecting the state 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.380
 our blood vessels and ours through bleeding 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.819
 what positive influence did the energy have on the games? 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.210
 Afford 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.759
 she considered already mentioned organic foods are plus 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.419
 our red blood cells 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.620
 what makes these in turn movable and the risk of clumping 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.419
 reduced 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.870
 The blood flow is thereby optimized and our body vital with me 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.089
 NHTSA stuff that was 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.829
 Scientific theses support above all the assumption that the 

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.979
 Magnetic fields favorably influence the Big Blue Tongue and cell metabolism 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.779
 Of course, the personal experiences are crucial 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.249
 in clinics and practices 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.089
 The complex buddy and school concept is divided into the three areas 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.210

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.319
 as important as a stable foundation for your house 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.339
 is a stable creation for her body 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:59.419
 the many years of experience from my also the BDR between practice numerous
