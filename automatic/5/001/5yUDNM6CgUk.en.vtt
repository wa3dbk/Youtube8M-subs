00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.940
 from good day 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.790
 watch this video 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.400
 I made myself such a turning knot 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:36.530
 Offset finger hole idea 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.470
 what came to me and i'll do something already 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.470
 did well in short here goes the thread 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:01:05.990
 naturally fate I think it will 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 more reliably and hard here goes the nut with 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:17.030
 lock bolt also gadget I can not 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:23.200
 unscrewing is necessary to look for the key 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.200
 there is a gas hexagon movement such 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:34.970
 good thing twists plus more 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.360
 grabs our grip for 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.360
 gain 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.409
 one more I want to order this one that regiment 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.070
 more 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:57.170
 from thick material and why 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.690
 there was one swivel node and an adapter and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:09.369
 how would this on a trailer on a trailer more 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.369
 I will have a light adapter, I hope 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.720
 i saw you a certain did to myself 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.840
 adapter such a motorcycle 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.450
 I liked the wheels I will do myself 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.010
 such a thought it will only go there when 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.880
 will cook on the pole she is weaker 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 and the table chair will be even thicker 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.550
 material table words cool make a sleeve 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.799
 for trailers infuriates it I will guess 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.980
 at one level to do and trailer and 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:53.980
 adapter to one we will only bushings 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 welded to the tongue 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 here the nut will loosen change 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.579
 will be 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.459
 I do nâ€™t know help yet 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.810
 did not advise such things I 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:15.100
 try what comes out of it 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.069

 such things did not work ideas can 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.890
 someone advise something this is it 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:43.129
 the best option but the problem is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:49.519
 uses one swivel unit 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:52.099
 immediately and on the adapter and on the trailer if 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.640
