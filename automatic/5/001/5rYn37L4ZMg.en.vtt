00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 thank you 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.000
 no 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.240
 m 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.690
 and 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.690
 Yes 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.000
 and well hello to all of you 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.800
 crazy and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.740
 a new pack always opening for the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.900
 toque liga bbva we were not going to 35 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.210
 miles that are still available a few 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.460
 time now 1h24 to open dippach to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.989
 35,000 credit I think that should be the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 do so here is a small opening pack 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.879
 we have the biggest mega packs the most 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.620
 big with them 38 returns to the elements it's me 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.809
 seems that's it at the level of the name of 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.250
 this pack 2 that are available so we 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.040
 are we going to open them to play absolutely 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.210
 nothing kept on this account we're just going 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.400
 see if we do not have a small free pack 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.500
 or here are credits that would hide 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.970
 towards the end this was the case for this 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.920
 first step that spies all the rest 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.019
 see directly resell quickly 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.159
 otherwise I would not have what it seems 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.260
 that at the beginning I had a little less 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.699
 of 350 thousand credit so suddenly in 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.430
 on the other hand, there are no questions 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.740
 we want to type blue typed draw 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.090
 pedros and liga bbva 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.770
 unfortunately it is not in map 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.680
 blue then suddenly we will resell 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.540
 directly all this is done 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.710
 and so suddenly we're going to hope we're going 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.390
 hope it's true that there both 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.340
 last no girlfriend for this bone bbva 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.500
 was not necessarily extraordinary 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 very very very very very sad so 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.520
 we never know we never know 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 these packs to 35000 if we can if we can 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.660
 type of humor if you can type blue 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.000
 if we can type something super 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.290
 interesting moments of the Messti 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.970
 ronaldo it is true that there is name 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.160
 evening maria and dialects like you 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 the situation 10 we only have big 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.600
 players for this tax liga bbva so 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.130
 no matter if one believes or not 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.140
 other helpers to listen to one would not 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.030
 not there we would be no way out at all 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.350
 so all that we do not care we do not care 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.210
 we do not care so I think all that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.940
 again we will resell 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 quickly and so we're going 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.490
 open them here is the pack that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 who's going to say he's going to signal he's going 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 represent half of this pack opening 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 the fifth easter to 35,000 credit 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.580
 matichuk 83.2 general we also had 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.850
 rettenbach 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.890
 there will be nothing afterwards no 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.860
 no credit free pack we crazy to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.700
 the sixth easter to 35,000 credit on 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.470
 continue to believe it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.440
 we continue to believe why not 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 why not type blue karim benzema 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.580
 karim benzema we will still put it 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.170
 on the pile of transfers but that's it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 because it mixes of miley not blue it is not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.310
 not blue unfortunately for us but 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 see anyway we typed pedro did not 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.330
 typed benzema is what is it 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.020
 you be a little sign that's a little 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.150
 sign as what 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.700
 ilan is the proud of blue in this pack 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.990
 opening I do not know anything in all 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.460
 case and then listen, we'll get some blue 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.430
 unfortunately for us it's not 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.570
 it's not the blue the most blue 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.340
 interesting are these two so I'm 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.230
 remember more it's the teuf teuf was the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.260
 touch americana or something like 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.760
 that in all cases it's all 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.500
 it's all championships rather 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 from latin america if I do not say 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.040
 nonsense so suddenly we've been typing 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.990
 blue gutiérrez at the level of your stats that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.370
 remains correct but at the level of its price 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.990
 it's not necessarily extraordinary 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.610
 moment not complain we will not get 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.320
 complain we were given blue so we 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.580
 will take it 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.890
 gladly we are going to chain here it is we 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.080
 remains three packs at 35,000 credit we 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 wants blue liga bbva 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.019
 if it would be possible it would not be too much 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.360
 ask is it going to be in 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.130
 this one not at all godding odinga 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.590
 it is true that in more if I had had 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.760
 the last pack open rego dine with 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.720
 the few matches that I could 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.360
 watch 2 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.040
 from atletico madrid it might have 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.680
 could deserve 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.200
 according to me we're going to say to integrate 7.7 toth 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.400
 bbva but it's true that on the other hand 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.720
 there is really very heavy in 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.910
 defender of liga bbva 81.2 general for 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.680
 the band is a failure to 35,000 credit 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.330
 that at this stage so much we do not care 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.190
 completely afterwards thereafter 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.660
 thereafter we have nothing of interest 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.580
 and so suddenly, here we are after 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 packs at 35 they will have laughs I think 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.630
 of 2,3 not that that's fifteen thousand credit 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.640
 as we are going to stay a little bit of 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.250
 credit on this account 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.050
 I do not have why I saw the I saw the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.840
 logo then the logo if I say no 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.890
 nonsense here it is he finally I check 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.850
 still before shooting a bullshit 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.709
 but it was Seville 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.970
 it's a pity it's a pity 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.880
 a pity again a player from 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.350
 bbva still not always no blues 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.180
 of bbva because I still do not admire 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.760
 blue here we still grabbed a player 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.830
 blue no legs of the head this end there 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.500
 but we will not get lost and chopper 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.290
 little blue lennon so we do not care 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.820
 diakity diakity of the blood that go when 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.500
 even a little bit of credit the convoy of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.120
 swing directly edge the stack of 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.070
 peace transfers says that dell who is going 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.740
 well he will stay us he will stay us 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.740
 down I think of easter at 15,000 credit a 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.200
 small pack at 7500 to complete this pack 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.510
 opening and will we be able to pop 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.280
 and blue to finish this pack opening 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.990
 in any case it will not be for this 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.210
 pack towards the southwards towards the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.070
 later we have nothing at all 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.780
 we resold quickly yeah I think not 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.820
 we will have in theirs not what you 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.260
 want a last pack at 15,000 credit 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.240
 so this one we see the skip and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.220
 magnificent magnificent magnificent 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.200
 beautiful that players we rare 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.479
 So suddenly we are reselling his 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.690
 directly arises no questions the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.040
 small pack at 7500 I oppose ammann is so 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.450
 we are given a lionel messi at 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.440
 cristiano ronaldo in this pack 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.060
 I do not know what I'm doing but this 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.030
 would be huge and well no we're going to 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.770
 give bunny bunny 80.2 general and so 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.060
 So that's welcome welcome and 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.640
 Ben I tell you I tell you all 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.990
 goodbye because there the jersey the 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.010
 shirt of the barça it's a pity I had 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.900
 there were still the players of the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.790
 barca to see there was suarez there 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.350
 had neymar had messiah well 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.030
 heard there were other players 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.310
 also that was very interesting 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.530
 so in this tax liga bbva 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.330
 unfortunately for these packs at 35 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.010
 miles 7 and pensions this time years 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 as I said we got a little blue 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.099
 even it's not necessarily extraordinary 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.810
 it's always less bad than 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.820
 last packs opening that I could do 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.470
 for this ode this bbva so here it is again 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.690
 once I hope this little pack 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.099
 opening for the toque bbb with the packs 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.020

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.560
