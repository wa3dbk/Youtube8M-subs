people get overly concerned with and the
you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.810> could<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> same<00:00:28.769> results

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you know I could get the same results

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
you know I could get the same results
with<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.369> 800<00:00:29.789> grit<00:00:29.880> stone<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> 3000<00:00:31.019> grit

stone or as I demonstrated in my earlier
video<00:00:34.110> production<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> sharpened<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> blade<00:00:35.940> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
video production I sharpened a blade on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
video production I sharpened a blade on
a<00:00:36.180> concrete<00:00:36.600> cinder<00:00:36.899> block<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> dropped<00:00:38.100> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
a concrete cinder block and dropped it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.200 
a concrete cinder block and dropped it
on<00:00:38.309> newspaper<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> razor-sharp<00:00:39.899> edge

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
on newspaper to get a razor-sharp edge

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.280 
on newspaper to get a razor-sharp edge
these<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> details<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> people

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these are one of the details that people

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.200 
these are one of the details that people
you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.980> choose<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.640> confuse<00:00:45.059> themselves

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you know choose to confuse themselves

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
you know choose to confuse themselves
with<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> last<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with and it's really the last thing that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
with and it's really the last thing that
you<00:00:47.370> should<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.670> concerned<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.629> I'll

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you should be concerned with the I'll

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
you should be concerned with the I'll
reiterate<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:51.030> point<00:00:51.270> again<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
reiterate the point again is that it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
reiterate the point again is that it's
99%<00:00:52.559> technique<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.960> 1%<00:00:54.960> 1%<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.670> tools<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.510> by

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
99% technique and 1% 1% the tools so by

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.860 
99% technique and 1% 1% the tools so by
laying<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.140> blades<00:00:58.500> flat<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> fine

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
laying this blades flat on the fine

stone
I<00:01:01.670> am<00:01:02.670> simply<00:01:03.059> polishing<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.960> some<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I am simply polishing out some of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.480 
I am simply polishing out some of the
rougher<00:01:04.979> scratches<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.689> secondary<00:01:07.170> edge

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
rougher scratches in that secondary edge

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
rougher scratches in that secondary edge
that<00:01:08.490> were<00:01:09.030> created<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:09.659> grinding<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> blade

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that were created by grinding the blade

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
that were created by grinding the blade
thin<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:12.290> that<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.880> helps<00:01:15.150> protect

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
thin and that will that helps protect

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.830 
thin and that will that helps protect
the<00:01:15.600> blade<00:01:15.780> against<00:01:16.820> rust<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.119> makes<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.659> look

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the blade against rust it makes it look

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
the blade against rust it makes it look
prettier<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.220> makes<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> easier<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
prettier and it also makes it easier to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.100 
prettier and it also makes it easier to
clean<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.560> gives<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:24.110> lower

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
clean up and it gives it a lower

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
clean up and it gives it a lower
friction<00:01:25.560> coefficient<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.610> you're<00:01:26.729> cutting

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
friction coefficient when you're cutting

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.819 
friction coefficient when you're cutting
through<00:01:27.240> things<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.200> highly<00:01:28.560> polished

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
through things the more highly polished

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.580 
through things the more highly polished
the<00:01:29.100> blade<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> shiny

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the blade is and get this nice and shiny

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.270 
the blade is and get this nice and shiny
get<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> ready<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:36.500> class<00:01:37.530> shaving

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
get it ready for class shaving

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:59.930 
get it ready for class shaving
demonstration

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.650 

okay<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.170> after<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.890> polished<00:02:02.660> that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
okay so after we have polished that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.770 
okay so after we have polished that
secondary<00:02:04.320> edge<00:02:04.620> we<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.580> raise<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
secondary edge we will raise it up a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:16.540 
secondary edge we will raise it up a
hair<00:02:07.050> again<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.030> strop<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.900> primary<00:02:10.560> edge

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.020 

now<00:02:17.550> there's<00:02:17.880> an<00:02:18.000> important<00:02:18.450> step<00:02:18.690> coming<00:02:18.930> up

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
now there's an important step coming up

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.630 
now there's an important step coming up
which<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.450> remove<00:02:21.870> any<00:02:22.290> burrs<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.490> may

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
which is to remove any burrs that may

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.870 
which is to remove any burrs that may
have<00:02:23.880> formed<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.470> edge<00:02:25.650> during<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
have formed on the edge during the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.880 
have formed on the edge during the
grinding<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.800> primary<00:02:29.400> edge<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
grinding in of the primary edge and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.740 
grinding in of the primary edge and
stropping<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> primary<00:02:32.760> edge<00:02:32.940> what<00:02:33.630> we're

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
stropping of the primary edge what we're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.200 
stropping of the primary edge what we're
going<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> use<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.340> soft<00:02:35.850> piece<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
going to use is just this soft piece of

wood here it's just under the weight of
the<00:02:39.510> blade<00:02:39.720> itself<00:02:40.080> we're<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.890> lightly

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the blade itself we're going to lightly

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.640 
the blade itself we're going to lightly
draw<00:02:41.310> through<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> wood<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> couple<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.330> times

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
draw through the wood a couple of times
