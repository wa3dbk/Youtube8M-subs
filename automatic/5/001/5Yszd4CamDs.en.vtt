00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
happened this is the second point I've

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.600

had<00:00:36.790> had<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.989> have<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.440> happened<00:00:38.980> trying<00:00:39.520> to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
had had to have this happened trying to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.830 
had had to have this happened trying to
do<00:00:39.730> this<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.180> first<00:00:40.390> one<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.630> thought<00:00:40.780> I

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
do this the first one I thought I

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.960 
do this the first one I thought I
figured<00:00:41.200> out<00:00:41.290> what<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.440> did<00:00:41.770> but<00:00:42.010> obviously<00:00:42.780> not

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
figured out what I did but obviously not

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.520
