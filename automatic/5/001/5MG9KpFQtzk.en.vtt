00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.959
 as you bring the welcome to the new video of me 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.960
 and it was 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720
 which was a very long time ago 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.539
 So network video 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.810
 and today I'm doing something completely new 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.369
 and again it goes into effect 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.000
 Klose may have come into effect for the TSG right 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 I found Michel for the PSP 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.810
 It never went down and it drips 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 Lehmann Croft means that came 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.710
 and organic and I just wanted to give you a damn 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.030
 Rome KGaA 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.870
 yes I think it's pretty interesting 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 to see that too and you see 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 Options Controls Analog Stick 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.370
 Camenically subordinate citizens 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 Controls 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 quite 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.230
 you come 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 guild evening 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 so ClÃ©ment's revelation 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 how so 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.070
 who wants to know more about this how that works 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.630
 Simply personally 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 Answer Schwerte one hundred percent 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 and you the most amazing thing and there I am already 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.990
 masterfully of course my left 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.730
 Button changed 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.400
 but it does not matter 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.650
 surely the graphics are not the same 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
 So lying Advantech Job Act or something 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.999
 you can but what is it 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.979
 I'll tell you that you can 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.189
 it's just almost build 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.759
 but pretty cool 15 representatives table one say 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.899
 even with Marx form high 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.859
 but he thinks he does not leave 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.859
 Bonn Euro actually everything there 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.539
 so that people's races rain again 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.260
 that hangs more beautiful games by the way, so you can do it soon 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.039
 and 10 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.319
 it will be coming back soon again new videos of me that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.609
 to surprise 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.700
 about favorites and i am looking forward to lying more on the floor and blablabla that 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.009
 usual 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.429
 I would be happy 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.919
 Okay until next time Hauser
