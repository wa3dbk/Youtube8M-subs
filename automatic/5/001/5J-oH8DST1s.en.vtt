oh but we'll see what this one is wire
you<00:04:50.180> know<00:04:50.270> what<00:04:50.390> this<00:04:50.480> one<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.660> but<00:04:50.780> you'll<00:04:51.170> see

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
you know what this one is but you'll see

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.470 
you know what this one is but you'll see
what<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.590> one<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.800> there's<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.940> one<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.150> got

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
what this one is there's that one I got

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.300 
what this one is there's that one I got
that<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.630> size<00:04:53.960> six<00:04:54.470> saying<00:04:55.100> nothing<00:04:55.520> is<00:04:55.640> huge

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
that a size six saying nothing is huge

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.270 
that a size six saying nothing is huge
so<00:04:58.310> that's<00:04:58.490> what<00:04:58.670> that<00:04:58.820> looks<00:04:58.970> like<00:04:59.150> I<00:05:00.280> figured

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
so that's what that looks like I figured

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.950 
so that's what that looks like I figured
it'd<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.550> kind<00:05:01.790> of<00:05:01.850> cool<00:05:02.060> with<00:05:02.330> like<00:05:02.480> neutral

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
it'd be kind of cool with like neutral

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.220 
it'd be kind of cool with like neutral
sweaters<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:05.000> stuff<00:05:05.240> for<00:05:05.690> fall<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.020> winter

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
sweaters and stuff for fall and winter

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.170 
sweaters and stuff for fall and winter
so<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.160> have<00:05:07.310> some<00:05:07.490> new<00:05:07.610> additions<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.090> my

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
so I have some new additions to my

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.390 
so I have some new additions to my
kitchen<00:05:08.480> not<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.080> people<00:05:09.290> necessarily<00:05:10.250> will

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
kitchen not that people necessarily will

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.490 
kitchen not that people necessarily will
care<00:05:10.580> about<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.210> my<00:05:11.750> mom<00:05:11.930> got<00:05:12.140> me<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.320> new

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.930 
care about that but my mom got me a new
coffeemaker<00:05:12.920> which<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.520> don't<00:05:13.580> really<00:05:13.790> drink

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
make hot chocolate and just boil water

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.900 
make hot chocolate and just boil water
in<00:05:20.450> general<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.490> was<00:05:22.490> planning<00:05:22.730> on<00:05:22.820> getting

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
in general but I was planning on getting

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.280 
in general but I was planning on getting
one<00:05:23.150> anyway<00:05:23.450> because<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.810> thought<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.080> would<00:05:24.170> be

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
one anyway because I thought it would be

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.560 
one anyway because I thought it would be
good<00:05:24.410> for<00:05:24.470> guests<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.280> other<00:05:26.090> people<00:05:26.390> drink

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
good for guests and other people drink

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.000 
good for guests and other people drink
coffee<00:05:26.600> just<00:05:27.080> because<00:05:27.230> I<00:05:27.320> don't<00:05:27.380> doesn't<00:05:27.830> mean

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
coffee just because I don't doesn't mean

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.320 
coffee just because I don't doesn't mean
I<00:05:28.040> don't<00:05:28.160> need<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.430> have<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.580> coffeemaker<00:05:28.910> plus

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
I don't need to have a coffeemaker plus

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.760 
I don't need to have a coffeemaker plus
it's<00:05:29.540> single<00:05:29.810> serving<00:05:30.170> so<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:30.470> works<00:05:30.650> out

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
it's single serving so that works out

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.360 
it's single serving so that works out
really<00:05:30.920> well

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
really well

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.920 
really well
so<00:05:31.760> basically<00:05:32.030> what<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.300> do<00:05:32.420> is<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.630> get<00:05:32.780> these

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
so basically what you do is to get these

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.390 
so basically what you do is to get these
little<00:05:33.230> things<00:05:33.470> that<00:05:33.560> they<00:05:33.680> call<00:05:33.860> K<00:05:34.040> cups<00:05:34.280> and

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
little things that they call K cups and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.190 
little things that they call K cups and
you<00:05:34.490> can<00:05:34.640> have<00:05:34.820> tea<00:05:35.180> or<00:05:35.210> different<00:05:35.840> kinds<00:05:36.110> of

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
you can have tea or different kinds of

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.830 
you can have tea or different kinds of
coffee<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:36.970> there's<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.090> like<00:05:38.120> individual

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840

coffee and there's just like individual
single<00:05:39.140> serving<00:05:39.620> cups<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.750> you<00:05:42.020> left<00:05:42.200> this<00:05:42.290> up

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
single serving cups and you left this up

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.560 
single serving cups and you left this up
and<00:05:42.590> put<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.860> in<00:05:42.950> there<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.340> it<00:05:44.210> Pierce's<00:05:44.540> a

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
and put it in there and it Pierce's a

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.120 
and put it in there and it Pierce's a
hole<00:05:44.780> through<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.020> top<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.230> force<00:05:45.680> hot<00:05:45.920> water

hole through the top and force hot water

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.480 
hole through the top and force hot water
through<00:05:46.430> it<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:48.590> put<00:05:48.800> your<00:05:48.890> cup<00:05:49.070> down<00:05:49.250> here
