and if you ever saw any my vlog channels

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.820 
and if you ever saw any my vlog channels
you<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.820> I've<00:04:16.940> always<00:04:17.299> done<00:04:18.260> an<00:04:18.440> intro

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
you know that I've always done an intro

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.500 
you know that I've always done an intro
and<00:04:19.100> when<00:04:19.250> i<00:04:19.280> started<00:04:19.700> my<00:04:19.790> gaming<00:04:20.030> channel<00:04:20.180> i

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
and when i started my gaming channel i

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.120 
and when i started my gaming channel i
thought<00:04:20.720> hey<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.140> should<00:04:21.200> have<00:04:21.500> an<00:04:21.620> intro<00:04:21.979> as

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
thought hey I should have an intro as

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.010 
thought hey I should have an intro as
well<00:04:22.370> now<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.940> know<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.180> smooth<00:04:23.599> doesn't

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
well now I know that smooth doesn't

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.860 
well now I know that smooth doesn't
intro<00:04:24.289> sometimes<00:04:24.800> also<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> guess<00:04:26.630> that's

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
intro sometimes also so I guess that's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.940 
intro sometimes also so I guess that's
where<00:04:27.050> people<00:04:27.169> draw<00:04:27.530> similar

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
where people draw similar

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.620 
where people draw similar
and<00:04:28.370> if<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.520> think<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.880> copied<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.420> that's

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and if you think I copied in that's

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.510 
and if you think I copied in that's
that's<00:04:29.960> fine<00:04:30.230> that's<00:04:30.470> your<00:04:30.650> decision<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.310> think

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
that's fine that's your decision I think

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.090 
that's fine that's your decision I think
the<00:04:31.850> people<00:04:32.030> who<00:04:32.210> watch<00:04:32.510> my<00:04:32.720> videos<00:04:32.800> know<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
the people who watch my videos know that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.860 
the people who watch my videos know that

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
I put a lot of hard work into them and I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.780 
I put a lot of hard work into them and I
don't<00:04:36.050> copy<00:04:36.290> people<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.800> do<00:04:36.860> my<00:04:37.130> own<00:04:37.160> thing<00:04:37.580> and

don't copy people I do my own thing and
I<00:04:38.300> don't<00:04:38.420> think<00:04:38.750> we<00:04:38.840> sound<00:04:39.110> alike<00:04:39.200> at<00:04:39.530> all<00:04:39.650> and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
the second thing that I think people may

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.160 
the second thing that I think people may
I<00:04:43.550> guess<00:04:43.940> they<00:04:44.090> assume<00:04:44.420> that<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.660> copy<00:04:44.870> chris
