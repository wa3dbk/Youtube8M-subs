00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
somewhere around 35 or 36 AD the problem

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.090 
somewhere around 35 or 36 AD the problem

Rome<00:00:53.220> in<00:00:53.519> 36<00:00:54.059> ad<00:00:54.299> and<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.500> means<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> Jesus

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
Rome in 36 ad and that means that Jesus

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.039 
Rome in 36 ad and that means that Jesus
would<00:00:56.400> have<00:00:56.460> had<00:00:56.610> months<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.210> years<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.960> have

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
two to three years in order to be

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
two to three years in order to be

the date that Jesus was born if we do

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
then that means that the very earliest

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.499 
then that means that the very earliest
Jesus<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.789> been<00:01:23.880> born<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.390> have

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.620 
had his temple tantrum and a
conversation<00:05:23.580> with<00:05:23.730> Nicodemus<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.540> so

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
conversation with Nicodemus and so

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.150 
conversation with Nicodemus and so
consequently<00:05:24.870> he<00:05:25.350> had<00:05:25.500> apparently<00:05:25.800> already

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
consequently he had apparently already

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.490 
consequently he had apparently already
started<00:05:26.850> his<00:05:26.940> ministry<00:05:27.120> while<00:05:27.990> John<00:05:28.350> the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
started his ministry while John the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.610 
started his ministry while John the
Baptist<00:05:28.950> was<00:05:29.160> still<00:05:29.430> free<00:05:30.230> so<00:05:31.230> I<00:05:31.260> guess<00:05:31.470> the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
Baptist was still free so I guess the

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.470 
Baptist was still free so I guess the
question<00:05:32.010> is<00:05:32.130> for<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> Christians<00:05:32.910> how<00:05:33.419> do

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
question is for the Christians how do

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.960 
question is for the Christians how do
you<00:05:33.750> reconcile<00:05:34.350> all<00:05:34.800> these<00:05:35.250> different<00:05:35.610> gospel

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
you reconcile all these different gospel

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.780 
you reconcile all these different gospel
accounts<00:05:36.440> remembering<00:05:37.440> that<00:05:37.860> there<00:05:38.130> are<00:05:38.370> no

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
accounts remembering that there are no

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.610 
accounts remembering that there are no
errors<00:05:39.240> in<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.600> Bible<00:05:39.960> we're<00:05:40.140> talking<00:05:40.530> about

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
errors in the Bible we're talking about

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.590 
errors in the Bible we're talking about
the<00:05:40.919> inerrant<00:05:41.280> Word<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.520> God<00:05:41.580> here<00:05:42.380> good<00:05:43.380> luck
