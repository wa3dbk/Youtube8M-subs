00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.930
 the media pressure is almost non-existent 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.789
 the Spanish synchronized team 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.500
 he works hard and quietly hurrying every 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.540
 second of the day to take advantage of 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.720
 time left for the World 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.030
 kazan on July 25 the cities of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.550
 hama debuts in the Russian city without 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.329
 barely make noise we are much more 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.659
 quiet 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.960
 the girls because although the team is very 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.479
 new are facing this situation of 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.750
 a calm and very serene way and 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.059
 really because the media do not have the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.070
 expectations that they had two years ago what 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.659
 which then the circumstances and the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.630
 feelings that we live are very 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.610
 different but the tension is palpable in 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.649
 every training for most 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.429
 the girls is their first world cup and the 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.610
 responsibility weighs much more nerves to 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.869
 sports level and competition level 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.299
 because it's a very young team is a 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.710
 very renovated team compared to 2013 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.710
 that we had a maturity 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.790
 an experience that was very noticeable 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.430
 when facing big 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 competitions 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.540
 this team is missing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.229
 each advance in the exercise is analyzed 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.479
 and revised to correct the errors that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.840
 the judges look closely at the time of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.840
 score 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.560
 it was far behind 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.750
 Y 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.399
 and also hold our numbers 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.920
 meaning 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.689
 and repeat the seven medals that they won 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.400
 at the Barcelona World Cup two 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.400
 years is almost impossible 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 the circumstances of now are very 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.349
 different from those of 2013 with which 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.780
 the results do not have to be the 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.730
 ourselves we are going to defend the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.980
 maximum possible medals knowing that the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.799
 situation now is not the same as in the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.659
 2013 for many reasons because china by 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.519
 example will participate in the modality 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.530
 of team that did not participate in 2013 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.019
 because there are other countries like ukraine 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.640
 as japan they are working very hard 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.560
 and they rise very strong 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.290
 we are going to fight evidently for the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.639
 as many medals as possible but good 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.620
 we have them we have to fight 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.780
 we have to compete and it 's so difficult is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.480
 the fact that he did not win and seven 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.400
 medals in the world cup of Barcelona is 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.769
 I think that very beneficial because it is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.900
 a very good image of our country the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.389
 Ona Carbonell low in the exercises 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 of convoy by teams subtracts potential 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.530
 group only 6 swimmers survive 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.810
 world barcelona so 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.970
 they practically had to start from 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.580
 zero 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.170
 at the level of duo and team level I 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.240
 I say that's where the competition has been 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.100
 hardest position for us that is 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.900
 where we have the actual renovation I think 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.120
 Sincerely, we are so close to a 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.740
 third place as a fifth with what 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 which the third the fourth and the fifth 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.210
 are going to be the most contested posts with 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.240
 really very little difference of points 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.070
 and it was going to be just as easy or equal 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 difficult is to be in the third in the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.480
 podium like being in fifth place 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.510
 it seems that the years have not gone through 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.940
 managua there when thrown to the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.940
 pool transforms and its expressiveness 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.370
 Strength and elasticity emerge as when 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.040
 was the star of the Spanish synchro 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.630
 his 38 years and with two children who more 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.970
 lives a second youth 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.310
 the mixed duo one of the novelties of the 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.470
 world of kazan and his pupil pau ribas 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.810
 to which by the way doubles the age are 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.709
 the culprits of his reappearance after 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.350
 of three years of cited was a little bit all 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.690
 that little by little I have been encouraging 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.650
 idea 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.930
 initials 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.290
 see how I was to ohl and start it 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.290
 to train 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.990
 I will look for a partner for this new mixed 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.969
 and little by little as I started to train myself 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.479
 he was pulling me with her into the water 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:45.180
 because I was feeling and thinking because I 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.860
 I see capable and look at me was cheering in the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.030
 team also encouraged me and the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.610
 final 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.770
 I made the decision that if at the level of 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.390
 competition his new adventure started in 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.400
 June at the open of Spain 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.860
 there premiere and won with the exercise that 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.720
 the couple will perform in kazan though 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.540
 in Spain 'surprise this new 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.520
 modality in USA and France and years ago 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.500
 that practiced in fact these two 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.810
 pioneer countries are the maximum 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.480
 favorites next to russia and italy 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.020
 we will be there trying to get closer 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.050
 to the top levels to be as close 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.900
 possible of the medals and about all that 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.419
 give a good image having a good time 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.540
 let it be said that our era 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.570
 powerful and you're 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.820
 pau ribas has been practicing 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.890
 synchronized swimming and for him it 's a 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.500
 luxury compete next to one of their 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.230
 Muses of the impro is aware that the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.700
 level of its rivals is very high the 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.540
 Most of the guys are working 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.510
 in the circus of the sun or have worked 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.630
 they are super good and well let's have 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.000
 a well-made one to enjoy a lot and do 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.100
 story that is super new and we are going to 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.550
 give the face to the judges all this is 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.440
 very new and they do not even have a 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.180
 previous criterion and do not know do not know 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.620
 very well what will be what 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.360
 important that is to score I think that 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.760
 is a bit still in this aspect a bit 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.760
 lost and it will be a bit to see what happens 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.580
 and there is no doubt that in kazan the synchro 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.270
 begins a new cycle with dyes of 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.270
 show
