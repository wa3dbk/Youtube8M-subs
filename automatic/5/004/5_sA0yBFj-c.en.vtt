00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
clearly how to do it right here so no

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.059 
clearly how to do it right here so no
one<00:02:24.790> with<00:02:24.940> clockwork<00:02:25.150> recovery<00:02:25.780> right<00:02:25.930> now

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
one with clockwork recovery right now

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.820 
one with clockwork recovery right now
that's<00:02:27.069> just<00:02:27.250> zooming<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:29.530> how

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
that's just zooming on this know how

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.940 
that's just zooming on this know how
well<00:02:30.129> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.519> see<00:02:31.269> that<00:02:31.299> if<00:02:31.720> well<00:02:31.959> at<00:02:32.080> all<00:02:32.230> but

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
well you can see that if well at all but

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.309 
well you can see that if well at all but
now<00:02:33.069> you're<00:02:33.400> gonna<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.760> clock<00:02:33.940> recovery

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
now you're gonna see the clock recovery

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.050 
now you're gonna see the clock recovery
from<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.500> route<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:36.580> showed<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.849> guys<00:02:36.910> in

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
from the route that I showed you guys in

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.789 
from the route that I showed you guys in
the<00:02:37.120> last<00:02:37.209> video<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:38.319> want<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> go<00:02:38.590> down

the last video and you want to go down

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.240 
the last video and you want to go down
to<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:40.330> it's<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> fifth<00:02:41.500> option<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
to think it's the fifth option for the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.940 
to think it's the fifth option for the
option<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:42.640> install<00:02:43.000> zip<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.329> sdcard<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:44.860> you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
option is install zip from sdcard if you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.920 
option is install zip from sdcard if you
guys<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.190> read<00:02:45.340> install<00:02:46.329> zip<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:46.569> sdcard

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
guys can read install zip from sdcard

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.630 
guys can read install zip from sdcard

that we just download and they'll be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.729 
that we just download and they'll be
pretty<00:03:22.090> easily<00:03:22.269> just<00:03:22.540> easy<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.350> distinguish

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
pretty easily just easy to distinguish

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.470 
pretty easily just easy to distinguish
it's<00:03:23.950> pretty<00:03:24.130> much<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.340> longest<00:03:24.700> one<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:25.299> the

it's pretty much the longest one on the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.199 
it's pretty much the longest one on the
list<00:03:26.220> usually<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.280> very<00:03:27.400> bottom<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.819> then

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
list usually the very bottom and then

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.309 
list usually the very bottom and then
what<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.540> want<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.690> do<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.019> want<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
what you want to do is you just want to

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.129 
what you want to do is you just want to
hit<00:03:29.440> up<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.700> trackball<00:03:31.000> again<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.450> then

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
hit up to the trackball again and then

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.170 
hit up to the trackball again and then
confirm<00:03:32.980> install<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.549> cannot<00:03:33.819> be<00:03:33.910> undone

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
confirm install this cannot be undone

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.089 
confirm install this cannot be undone
and<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.319> can<00:03:35.440> obviously<00:03:35.500> install<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
and you can obviously install the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
regular kernel again if you wanted to

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.479 
regular kernel again if you wanted to
but<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.680> get<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.739> these<00:03:38.829> new<00:03:38.980> options<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
but you get all these new options and

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.229 
but you get all these new options and
you<00:03:39.549> just<00:03:39.700> scroll<00:03:39.970> down<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.359> s<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:42.239> then

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
you just scroll down to the s and then

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.020 
you just scroll down to the s and then
you<00:03:43.419> press<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> optical<00:03:44.079> trackball<00:03:44.410> again

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
you press the optical trackball again

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.039 
you press the optical trackball again
and<00:03:47.130> it'll<00:03:48.130> install<00:03:48.459> itself<00:03:49.049> extracting

from<00:03:52.000> sdcard<00:03:52.299> complete<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.739> was<00:03:53.919> quick<00:03:54.069> wasn't

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
from sdcard complete it was quick wasn't

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.699 
from sdcard complete it was quick wasn't
it<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.639> was<00:03:55.569> really<00:03:55.720> quick<00:03:55.900> actually<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.470> think

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
it I was really quick actually I think

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.559 
it I was really quick actually I think
it<00:03:56.950> took<00:03:57.069> longer<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.459> last<00:03:57.639> time<00:03:57.819> maybe<00:03:58.480> I

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
it took longer the last time maybe I

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:06.229 
it took longer the last time maybe I
already<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:59.019> in<00:03:59.130> anyways

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.660 

okay<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.689> then<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.079> just<00:04:08.109> basically<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:09.489> want

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
okay so then you just basically you want

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.699 
okay so then you just basically you want
to<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.629> that<00:04:10.719> took<00:04:10.840> me<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.019> sec<00:04:11.200> but<00:04:11.379> you<00:04:11.469> got<00:04:11.620> to

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
to so that took me a sec but you got to

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.259 
to so that took me a sec but you got to
hit<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.920> UP<00:04:12.010> button<00:04:12.189> a<00:04:12.430> few<00:04:12.459> times<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:13.030> get<00:04:13.150> to

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
hit the UP button a few times to get to

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.529 
hit the UP button a few times to get to
the<00:04:13.359> go<00:04:13.480> back<00:04:14.790> things<00:04:15.790> sorry<00:04:16.030> about<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.209> but

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
the go back things sorry about that but

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.879 
the go back things sorry about that but
it's<00:04:16.660> pretty<00:04:16.750> easy<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.079> take<00:04:17.259> go<00:04:17.410> back<00:04:17.620> I

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
it's pretty easy you just take go back I

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.439 
it's pretty easy you just take go back I
already<00:04:18.039> had<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.340> enabled<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:18.880> disabled<00:04:19.419> it

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
already had it enabled and I disabled it

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.779 
already had it enabled and I disabled it
so<00:04:19.919> try<00:04:20.919> not<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.100> do<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.549> just<00:04:21.579> hit

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
the UP button and it'll be able to go

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.990 
the UP button and it'll be able to go
back<00:04:23.080> button<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:23.979> see<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.220> there<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.910> you

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
you better e battery life and shouldn't

which<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.699> optimal<00:05:04.030> one<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.240> choose<00:05:04.419> but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
which is the optimal one to choose but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.219 
which is the optimal one to choose but
overclocking<00:05:06.910> does<00:05:07.060> risk<00:05:07.419> hurting<00:05:08.020> your

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
that but under bolting will definitely

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.200 
that but under bolting will definitely
save<00:05:14.409> you<00:05:14.440> bad<00:05:14.650> ton<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.039> battery<00:05:15.280> life<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.729> don't
