how<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:55.120> go<00:03:55.359> about<00:03:55.480> achieving<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.340> 30<00:03:57.340> years

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
how to go about achieving it 30 years

pretty<00:04:00.100> close<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.670> vision<00:04:00.880> what<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:01.359> had

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
pretty close to that vision what we had

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.590 
pretty close to that vision what we had
all<00:04:01.930> those<00:04:02.319> years<00:04:02.380> ago<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.239> who<00:04:04.239> can<00:04:04.450> argue

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
all those years ago and who can argue

all those years ago and who can argue
with<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.200> reality<00:04:06.040> certainly<00:04:06.850> the

with this reality certainly the

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.059
