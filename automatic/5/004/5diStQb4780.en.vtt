like<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.140> streams<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.799> whatever<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> all

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
like in our streams or whatever you all

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.010 
like in our streams or whatever you all
probably<00:01:44.790> wouldn't<00:01:45.180> even<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.420> talking<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

probably wouldn't even be talking to
each<00:01:46.200> other<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> wasn't<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.310> us<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.210> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
