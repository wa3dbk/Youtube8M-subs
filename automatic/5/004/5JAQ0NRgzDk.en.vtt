00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hello, what are we going to do today? 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.860
 They are ornaments for the Christmas tree 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.200
 we are going to use eggs that we will have 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.299
 emptied at first making a couple 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.340
 of holes one below and one above in 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.160
 as part of the egg will take 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.270
 this for example 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.910
 I am more visito that we have here the 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.990
 two holes 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.710
 and let's start 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.560
 for example with the glitter 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 which has the shape of stars 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 let's put a few here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.250
 let's trace 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.500
 with the same glue 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.340
 a triangular shape in which we will go 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.460
 hitting 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 the eggs the stars in the egg 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 to help us catch the stars 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.940
 I have picked up a toothpick soaked a little in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.550
 Water 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.890
 then like a little star 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.880
 and placed it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 How is it going 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 and so on 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.460
 in all that is the glue 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 i 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.740
 a needle that is quite large that is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.890
 as long as the egg is to be able to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 go through the thread 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 how 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.670
 This is a thread of several threads of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.090
 colors between silver and gray 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.159
 we make that decorated the thoughts 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.159
 the little caves less than that 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.670
 that has been all the length that is the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.940
 egg 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.930
 we see things the rope 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.180
 and we will put a ball 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.350
 down we will put it blue and purple as 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.920
 the stars below that are blue 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.920
 one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.960
 in a trick so that the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.319
 thread 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.749
 subtle with the scissors 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 you open the scissors to cut a little 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.680
 it already escapes us 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.420
 in the pieces that you have left over 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.439
 you put a drop of glue here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.439
 to then fix it there 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.530
 and you put it inside the hole 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.810
 at the top we have roses 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 we also choose the red red 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 red and gold 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.760
 we do the same as before 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.240
 here you can fix it directly 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.700
 because the knot we 're going to make will be 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.130
 up here to then hang it on 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.080
 the long 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.080
 We can installing directly 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.280
 we put it here 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.280
 what do we do 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.430
 it's not tight and now the only thing 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.430
 What we have to do is cut the excess 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.970
 and we do not have to hang 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.390
 let's make more models here we have 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 a simpler 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.819
 in gold we have done the same 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.469
 just as it has remained rough 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.609
 we are not going to put anything on him but 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.609
 I would be very burdened 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.400
 the glitter 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.730
 and now we will decorate it from another 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.730
 way 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.349
 i 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.740
 low
