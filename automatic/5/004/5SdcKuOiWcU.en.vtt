00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140 

I<00:00:01.550> think<00:00:02.550> if<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.850> anything<00:00:03.060> we're<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.929> team

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
I think if we're anything we're a team

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.930 
I think if we're anything we're a team
we<00:00:06.150> depend<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.340> team<00:00:08.340> spirit<00:00:08.700> and

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we depend a lot on that team spirit and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.310 
we depend a lot on that team spirit and
strength<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> group<00:00:11.750> I<00:00:12.750> think

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
strength we have as a group I think

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070

that's<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> our<00:00:14.280> best<00:00:14.490> qualities<00:00:15.089> when<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that's one of our best qualities when I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.679 
that's one of our best qualities when I
there<00:00:16.890> are<00:00:16.980> no<00:00:17.070> individuals<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> team<00:00:20.689> we
