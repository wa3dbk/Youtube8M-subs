I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.290> every<00:00:40.890> class<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.370> our<00:00:41.550> Creed<00:00:41.940> except

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I think every class is our Creed except

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
I think every class is our Creed except
for<00:00:42.629> supports<00:00:43.110> except<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.680> recently

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
for supports except for recently

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.660 
for supports except for recently
supports<00:00:44.610> power<00:00:44.879> group<00:00:45.149> mainly<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.670> why

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
supports power group mainly because why

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
supports power group mainly because why
it<00:00:47.730> wants<00:00:48.149> 80<00:00:48.329> carries<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.079> very

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it wants 80 carries to be very

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
it wants 80 carries to be very
overpowering<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.879> why<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.420> that's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
overpowering I don't know why but that's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
overpowering I don't know why but that's
just<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> fact<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:53.039> our<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.239> forever

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
just a fact they will our and forever

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.670 
just a fact they will our and forever
will<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.899> overpowered<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
will be overpowered so

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.120 
will be overpowered so
no<00:00:57.250> point<00:00:57.490> really<00:00:57.670> arguing<00:00:58.060> with<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:59.130> anyway

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
no point really arguing with that anyway

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.150 
no point really arguing with that anyway
um<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:00.940> every<00:01:01.840> class<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.590> know<00:01:02.680> powercli

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
um so every class is you know powercli

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.950 
um so every class is you know powercli
you<00:01:03.310> don't<00:01:03.460> really<00:01:03.580> even<00:01:03.670> look<00:01:04.330> at<00:01:04.449> recently

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.379 
think this is I'm going to talk about a
little<00:02:46.129> bit<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:46.519> i'll<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.909> much<00:02:47.060> time<00:02:47.329> so

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
little bit but i'll have much time so

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.770 
little bit but i'll have much time so
just<00:02:47.840> brief<00:02:48.230> over<00:02:48.620> yeah<00:02:49.609> do<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.239> important<00:02:50.689> to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
send to be better because of this and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.860 
send to be better because of this and
more<00:02:54.250> because<00:02:55.250> their<00:02:55.430> support<00:02:55.939> tend<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
more because their support tend to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.170 
more because their support tend to
continue<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.889> do<00:02:58.010> damage<00:02:58.280> sure<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.849> game<00:02:59.000> but

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
continue to do damage sure the game but

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.970 
continue to do damage sure the game but
by<00:02:59.599> in<00:02:59.659> game<00:02:59.750> their<00:03:00.049> damage<00:03:00.379> really<00:03:00.650> becomes

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
by in game their damage really becomes

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.649 
by in game their damage really becomes
insignificant<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.939> they<00:03:02.030> don't<00:03:02.209> have<00:03:02.329> items

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
insignificant if they don't have items

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.959 
insignificant if they don't have items
thing<00:03:03.349> is<00:03:03.500> supports<00:03:04.159> Endora<00:03:04.579> can<00:03:04.730> actually

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
thing is supports Endora can actually

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.550 
thing is supports Endora can actually
get<00:03:05.150> items<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.870> they're<00:03:06.019> getting<00:03:06.260> killed

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:08.449 
that's a big thing maybe they didn't

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.539 
that's a big thing maybe they didn't
want<00:03:08.750> them<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:08.989> they<00:03:09.079> will<00:03:09.230> get<00:03:09.409> them<00:03:09.560> there's
