00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.940
 well this is my gober 200 modified 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.520
 so he finished it 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.520
 but it's almost as I want 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.430
 of the modifications that I have made to him is 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.430
 the part of the tank 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.870
 how can you see the rear fender 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.130
 your directionals here in the 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.490
 directionals you need to place a 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.070
 flash air which is the one that will give the 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.040
 current that is in the handle 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.800
 left 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.960
 the flyer is going to be placed 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 in this part 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.320
 those little cables that are here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 are to place the flashes 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.520
 so if you need to put 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.000
 directional digita with lax strength 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000
 active 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.010
 that's how my directionals are that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010
 I put him 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.510
 although they are directly connected in 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.610
 this part 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.890
 here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 here in this part they are connected 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.920
 connected the cables of the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 directional 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.560
 I had a double seat but I took it off 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.560
 I can reposition it 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.550
 as you can see this is the 2015 model 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.550
 comes with another type of rin 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 the exhaust is running because if it heats up 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.590
 too 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.660
 and good 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.350
 there I have another small bag that goes in the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.350
 left part is the one on the right 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.700
 and that's how until now it's 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.700
 staying
