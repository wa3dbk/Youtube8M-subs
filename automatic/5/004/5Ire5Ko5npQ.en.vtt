America<00:03:08.150> which<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:10.250> kind<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.610> see<00:03:10.820> why<00:03:10.970> they

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
America which I can kind of see why they

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.610 
America which I can kind of see why they
would<00:03:11.300> think<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.600> what<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.350> objective
