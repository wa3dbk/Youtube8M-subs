00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.560
 order to make the training version true 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 pigtail spin 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.829
 lace is done very simply until you 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.229
 shut to the end while you still have 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.470
 some freedom in pigtails need 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.649
 pull side strands out of a pigtail 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.259
 it is important not to pull all the strand of the braid 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.149
 but only the very edge the more you don't 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.780
 bold and pull captive into character 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.619
 beautiful and surrounded by several strands 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.880
 happen or 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 and go on making such lace 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 possible only with this version of pigtails 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 dragon dragon on the contrary because 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.039
 that the whole spit is of our kind and is over 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.259
 hair 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.560
 we fly to the end of that part which 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.140
 endowed with creating lace for the rest 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 happiness and now is the time 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.060
 hairstyle diversify you can from 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.849
 the remaining part of the hair 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 makes the second skin arrange them 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.420
 parallels 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 and then connect the two braids together we 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.130
 make another option more complicated 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.440
 our pigtail will continue now in 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.109

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.310
 strands we will only top the back strands 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.320
 can take thicker 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.320
 straight up the hairline 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.050
 lace gives braids on soby therefore 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.750
 even 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.520

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.640
