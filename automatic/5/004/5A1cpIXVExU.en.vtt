00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 First, I have my hair 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.660
 again other products than the last one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 times 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.030
 this time but if I'm such an omega 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.969

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.939
 The best combination I ever had 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 used 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.900
 supple and they are also for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 been in the shower, the hair feel 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.909
 really soft and really that it 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 ago pleasant feeling I can only 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 recommend to buy this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.979
 The things are all at dm or in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.450
 any drogeriemarkt burkhard by 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.299
 used showering 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 this manual is made that way 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.810
 I have to do that kind of turban 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 can and that has such a button 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.630
 because my hair is really so and if so 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.549
 I then usually half an hour one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:07.259
 hour around with the urban yes then do 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.690
 I open my hair and then pull that 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.400
 all as they just made grateful 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.360
 if not these sausages here 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.709
 So up there is kulac you and I like 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 It's not like that when you look at it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.790
 Hair is interested when they are still wet 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.860
 was that she is not so good 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.049
 but want to entice you then 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 you have to hairdress your hair 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.489
 Of course you can do it as well 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.930
 do if you have dry hair 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.510
 but only the hair would have to 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.010
 a little wet when I'm with 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.230
 my hair is driving through christian 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.569
 I'm for when I balea the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.849
 I give myself moisture to milk 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.390
 about her were up in the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.390
 sharpen 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.480
 now comes to the essential 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.310
 and I never use it 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.110
 heat for curls is not so good 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
 because I like my hair now 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.450
 wants to grow long and healthy and me 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 I let myself some years ago 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.800
 not how long it keeps the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.890
 bought at the dm are such rubber 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.080
 Chopsticks and here you are in the year 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.880
 how it all works shows you 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.230
 now I hope that there is only dm 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.130
 but you will be something like that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.600
 Find 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.290
 The whole gives them in different 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.110
 Size everything and it is really whole 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.790
 fix yes then we start already at me 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.680
 take my brush always such a thing 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.140
 the part that I take myself now 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 through again and I like it more if 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.990
 so they do not attract so away for so 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.090
 screwed up to me but so I grow 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:49.090
 I take it all now and wheels 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.010
 Such a funny one now but yes 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.040
 then that would have to be up there with it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.530
 whole keeps squeezing tightly and it 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.330
 Do it now with all your h if that 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.070
 should not hold then used 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.940
 just a spanner or what I know 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.940
 to make it bright 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.520
 whole head and so on when the stress 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 then you can do that with the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.880
 Dry dry field 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.220
 but it is of course better if that 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 Whole night makes if you need 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.760
 it does not heat and then it dries 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
 whole by itself and if you are only early 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.389
 and that's what makes you curious 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.919
 Chopsticks are really that 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.100
 beautiful open 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.860
 I do not use any attachment spray now 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.620
 so if we just do it too damaging me 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.120
 I think it's not so important 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.200
 that the bells are together as well 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.090
 you are at the beginning 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.520
 I think it's all the better 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.130
 Of course , fall lure in the course of 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:10.000
 He has finished the whole day with it 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:12.729
 it's about like I only have mine now 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.740
 one and a half hours left in it and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.930
 that's why not so strong now 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.729
 lured and unfortunately there are still one 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.950
 bit humid but let's talk about that 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.960
 night then they dry much better because 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.650
 I now only one and a half hours in it 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.930
 to let 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.820
 but I think the result anyway 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.220
 really nice and I love it 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.320
 to have such lure and in the time 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.570
 really do it as often as I hope so 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.490
 you liked it and give mine 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.210
 thumbs up I wait that kind of wood 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.860
 that would make me very happy and 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.860
 Tell what in the next video bye
