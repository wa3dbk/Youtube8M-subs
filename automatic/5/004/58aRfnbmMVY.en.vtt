and<00:00:33.410> alkalinity<00:00:34.450> but<00:00:35.450> they<00:00:35.929> do<00:00:35.989> get<00:00:36.440> to

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and alkalinity but they do get to

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.579 
and alkalinity but they do get to
civitate<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.070> out<00:00:37.219> through<00:00:37.929> through<00:00:38.929> time<00:00:39.199> and

civitate it out through through time and

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.009 
civitate it out through through time and
also<00:00:40.249> as<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> corals<00:00:40.850> growing<00:00:41.120> may<00:00:41.510> use<00:00:41.719> all<00:00:41.929> the

calcium and alkalinity up for growth so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.299 
calcium and alkalinity up for growth so
although<00:00:44.809> you're<00:00:45.140> replenishing<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:45.920> doing

out<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.159> put<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.519> new<00:00:49.579> salted<00:00:50.210> water<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.749> you're

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
out and put a new salted water in you're

still going to be in time losing some of
these<00:00:53.809> trace<00:00:54.079> elements<00:00:54.589> so<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.829> may<00:00:55.010> be

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
these trace elements so it may be

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.910 
these trace elements so it may be
necessary<00:00:55.339> to<00:00:55.760> actually<00:00:56.749> dose<00:00:57.050> certain<00:00:57.739> trace

you<00:01:01.760> would<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:02.809> would<00:01:02.870> test<00:01:03.170> for<00:01:03.620> each<00:01:04.190> trace

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you would you would test for each trace

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.300 
you would you would test for each trace
element<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.750> make<00:01:05.930> sure<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.320> you're<00:01:06.650> within

the 1300 parts per million is where you

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.560

want to be as a report figure of what's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.200 
want to be as a report figure of what's
natural<00:01:17.990> seawater<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.009> test<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:19.640> and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
natural seawater is so you test that and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.200 
natural seawater is so you test that and
if<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.539> was<00:01:20.659> low<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:22.039> would<00:01:22.130> add<00:01:22.310> your

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
if it was low you would add your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.020 
if it was low you would add your
magnesium<00:01:23.570> trace<00:01:24.140> element<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.799> use<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.789> seek

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
magnesium trace element I use the seek

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.010 
magnesium trace element I use the seek
an<00:01:26.270> ultra<00:01:27.170> feature<00:01:27.350> range<00:01:27.799> on<00:01:28.539> magnesium<00:01:29.539> I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
an ultra feature range on magnesium I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.859 
an ultra feature range on magnesium I
find<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:30.979> nice<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.520> nice<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.149> strong<00:01:32.479> to

find it nice and nice and strong to
brings<00:01:33.229> your<00:01:33.409> magnesium<00:01:33.710> up<00:01:34.070> nice<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.369> quick

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
brings your magnesium up nice and quick

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.690 
brings your magnesium up nice and quick
it<00:01:35.780> has<00:01:36.049> no<00:01:36.409> ammonia<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.159> some<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
it has no ammonia in it some of the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.310 
it has no ammonia in it some of the
other<00:01:37.850> magnesium's<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.750> market<00:01:39.170> have

other magnesium's on the market have

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.219 
other magnesium's on the market have
ammonia<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.329> probably<00:01:41.539> well<00:01:41.840> no

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
ammonia and as you probably well no

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.319 
ammonia and as you probably well no
ammonia<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.250> don't<00:01:43.520> want<00:01:43.759> in<00:01:43.969> your<00:01:44.000> marine

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
ammonia you don't want in your marine

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.950 
ammonia you don't want in your marine
tank<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.740> also<00:01:45.890> comes<00:01:46.340> with<00:01:46.750> strontium<00:01:47.750> and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
tank it also comes with strontium and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.929 
tank it also comes with strontium and
boron<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:48.859> it<00:01:48.979> which<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.219> never<00:01:49.460> trace

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
boron in it which is never trace

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.719 
boron in it which is never trace
elements<00:01:50.420> which<00:01:50.539> are<00:01:50.630> good<00:01:50.869> for<00:01:50.899> caused<00:01:51.729> by

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
elements which are good for caused by

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.580 
elements which are good for caused by
won't<00:01:52.939> games<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.420> now<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.350> yeah

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
won't games of that now so yeah

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.679 
won't games of that now so yeah
basically<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.520> taste<00:01:55.789> test<00:01:56.210> for<00:01:56.299> your<00:01:56.450> amber

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
basically you taste test for your amber

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.319 
basically you taste test for your amber
your<00:01:56.990> magnesia<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.219> low<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.850> want<00:01:59.090> your

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
your magnesia if it's low you want your

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.899 
your magnesia if it's low you want your
magnesium<00:01:59.890> back<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.189> one<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.399> would<00:02:01.609> test

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
magnesium back is the one I would test

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.260 
magnesium back is the one I would test
for<00:02:02.119> first<00:02:02.420> because<00:02:03.490> magnesium<00:02:04.490> basically

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
for first because magnesium basically

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.830 
for first because magnesium basically
what<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.929> does<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.740> keeps<00:02:06.950> your<00:02:07.840> alkalinity

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
what it does is it keeps your alkalinity

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.339 
what it does is it keeps your alkalinity
and<00:02:09.320> your<00:02:10.220> calcium<00:02:10.510> sort<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.629> separate<00:02:12.319> from

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
and your calcium sort of separate from

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.869 
and your calcium sort of separate from
each<00:02:12.530> other<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:12.980> helps<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.459> keep<00:02:13.640> them<00:02:13.760> in

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
each other it helps to keep them in

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.390 
each other it helps to keep them in
water<00:02:14.120> solution<00:02:14.840> better<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.980> stops<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.370> from

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
water solution better it stops them from

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
water solution better it stops them from
disc

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
disc

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.880 
disc
taking<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> tank<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.910> could<00:02:18.240> put

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
taking out the tank so you could put

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.860 
taking out the tank so you could put
lots<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.010> alkalinity<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:20.880> tank<00:02:21.060> lots<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
lots of alkalinity in your tank lots of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.199 
lots of alkalinity in your tank lots of
calcium<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.500> tank<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.610> after<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
calcium in your tank and then after a

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.199 
calcium in your tank and then after a
week<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.590> test<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.130> still<00:02:26.520> finding

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
week or so you test it you still finding

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.340 
week or so you test it you still finding
your<00:02:27.480> quite<00:02:27.780> low<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.380> still<00:02:28.620> flopping<00:02:28.980> out

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
your quite low it's still flopping out

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.870 
your quite low it's still flopping out
by<00:02:31.350> having<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> magnet<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
by having the magnet you and that is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.580 
by having the magnet you and that is
generally<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.630> magnesium<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.350> low

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
generally because your magnesium is low

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.949 
generally because your magnesium is low
so<00:02:35.370> why<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.580> said<00:02:35.790> people<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.330> get<00:02:36.840> your

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
so why I said people is to get your

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.890 
so why I said people is to get your
magnesium<00:02:37.350> up<00:02:37.740> first<00:02:38.480> before<00:02:39.480> anything

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
magnesium up first before anything

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.360 
magnesium up first before anything
because<00:02:40.470> you've<00:02:40.590> been<00:02:40.680> pouring<00:02:41.040> money<00:02:41.220> down

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
because you've been pouring money down

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280 
because you've been pouring money down
the<00:02:41.640> drain<00:02:41.670> with<00:02:42.330> these<00:02:42.540> two<00:02:42.750> products

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the drain with these two products

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
the drain with these two products
because<00:02:43.910> they<00:02:44.910> work<00:02:45.120> hold<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> once<00:02:47.160> your

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
because they work hold so once your

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
because they work hold so once your
magnesium's<00:02:47.910> where<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.360> should<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.569> then<00:02:48.959> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
magnesium's where it should be then you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.130 
magnesium's where it should be then you
start<00:02:49.920> correcting<00:02:50.610> your<00:02:51.150> alkalinity<00:02:51.570> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
start correcting your alkalinity and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.130 
start correcting your alkalinity and
your<00:02:52.410> calcium<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.690> you'll<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.959> better

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
your calcium and you'll have better

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.110 
your calcium and you'll have better
results<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.860> way<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.400> you'll<00:02:56.640> find<00:02:56.880> you'll

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
results that way and you'll find you'll

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.150 
results that way and you'll find you'll
get<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.540> desired<00:02:57.870> levels<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.620> lot<00:02:58.920> quicker

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
get your desired levels a lot quicker

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.830 
get your desired levels a lot quicker
and<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.550> lot<00:02:59.640> easier<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:01.730> alkalinity

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
and a lot easier and alkalinity

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.330 
and a lot easier and alkalinity
bicarbonate<00:03:04.340> basically<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.640> one<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:07.340> key

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
bicarbonate basically is one of the key

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.410 
bicarbonate basically is one of the key
elements<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.850> coral<00:03:09.720> growth<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.459> hard<00:03:12.030> coral

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
elements to coral growth as a hard coral

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.820 
elements to coral growth as a hard coral
grows<00:03:12.750> he's<00:03:13.650> got<00:03:13.890> by<00:03:14.070> carbonate<00:03:14.690> calcium

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
grows he's got by carbonate calcium

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.110 
grows he's got by carbonate calcium
skeleton<00:03:16.830> which<00:03:17.640> nice<00:03:18.890> alkalinity<00:03:19.890> or

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
skeleton which nice alkalinity or

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
skeleton which nice alkalinity or
bicarbonate<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.600> water<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.650> make<00:03:22.860> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
bicarbonate in the water to make that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.979 
bicarbonate in the water to make that
skeleton<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.320> that's<00:03:25.530> why<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:25.950> important

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
skeleton so that's why that's important

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.720 
skeleton so that's why that's important
soft<00:03:27.989> corals<00:03:28.350> do<00:03:28.500> use<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.130> not<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.579> much

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
soft corals do use it but not so much

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.110 
soft corals do use it but not so much
it's<00:03:30.000> mainly<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.660> hard<00:03:31.430> LPS<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.459> SPS<00:03:33.090> corals

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's mainly your hard LPS and SPS corals

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520 
it's mainly your hard LPS and SPS corals
will<00:03:33.720> use<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.670> also<00:03:35.880> how<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.540> get<00:03:37.350> will<00:03:37.500> be

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
will use it and also how to get will be

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.500 
will use it and also how to get will be
a<00:03:37.590> nice<00:03:37.739> Coraline<00:03:38.340> purple<00:03:38.940> core<00:03:39.120> line<00:03:39.269> now<00:03:39.450> we

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
a nice Coraline purple core line now we

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.979 
a nice Coraline purple core line now we
growth<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.470> your<00:03:40.620> rocks<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.280> whatnot<00:03:41.989> and

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
growth on your rocks and whatnot and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.680 
growth on your rocks and whatnot and
you're<00:03:43.980> simulating<00:03:44.310> natural<00:03:45.150> seawater<00:03:45.360> as

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
you're simulating natural seawater as

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.840 
you're simulating natural seawater as
best<00:03:45.900> as<00:03:46.049> possible<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.799> that's<00:03:47.250> why<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.549> would

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
best as possible so that's why you would

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.610 
best as possible so that's why you would
want<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> up<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.510> high<00:03:48.690> as<00:03:48.900> well<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.470> know

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
want it up that high as well you know

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.850 
want it up that high as well you know
you<00:03:49.680> want<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.190> exactly<00:03:50.790> what<00:03:51.000> seawater<00:03:51.450> is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
you want it exactly what seawater is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.960 
you want it exactly what seawater is
because<00:03:52.860> that's<00:03:53.040> what<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.340> these<00:03:53.489> animals

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
because that's what all these animals

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.910 
because that's what all these animals
are<00:03:54.329> used<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.530> know<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.769> natural

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
are used to you know the natural

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.900 
are used to you know the natural
seawater

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
seawater

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.210 
seawater
that's<00:03:57.450> what<00:03:57.660> alkalinity<00:03:58.230> does<00:03:58.530> again<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
that's what alkalinity does again you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.670 
that's what alkalinity does again you
test<00:03:59.610> for<00:03:59.820> your<00:03:59.940> alkalinity<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.110> test<00:04:01.380> kit

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
test for your alkalinity with a test kit

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.610 
test for your alkalinity with a test kit
I<00:04:01.920> tend<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.700> use<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.239> Sully<00:04:03.989> four<00:04:04.260> test

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
I tend to use the some Sully four test

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.650 
I tend to use the some Sully four test
kits<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.070> find<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.430> quite<00:04:05.459> easy<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.000> use<00:04:06.269> and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
kits I find them quite easy to use and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.620 
kits I find them quite easy to use and
pretty<00:04:07.650> well<00:04:07.829> pretty<00:04:08.519> accurate<00:04:08.910> as<00:04:09.030> well<00:04:09.209> so

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
pretty well pretty accurate as well so

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.300 
pretty well pretty accurate as well so
again<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.230> know<00:04:10.350> good<00:04:10.560> clear<00:04:10.799> results<00:04:11.220> from

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
again you know good clear results from

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.560 
again you know good clear results from
it<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.660> test<00:04:12.989> test<00:04:13.890> first<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.549> incorrect<00:04:15.329> with

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
it so test test first and incorrect with

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.009 
it so test test first and incorrect with
your<00:04:15.690> trace<00:04:15.930> element<00:04:16.350> afterwards<00:04:16.859> again<00:04:17.010> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
your trace element afterwards again and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:26.110 
your trace element afterwards again and
moving<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:20.600> calcium<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:23.570> calcium<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:25.140> ball

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
moving on to calcium and calcium is ball

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.839 
moving on to calcium and calcium is ball
again<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.390> one<00:04:27.599> of<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> key<00:04:28.740> elements<00:04:29.220> to

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
again it's one of the key elements to

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.149 
again it's one of the key elements to
growth<00:04:30.089> and<00:04:30.300> skeleton<00:04:31.139> growth<00:04:31.349> of<00:04:31.619> the<00:04:31.709> corals

growth and skeleton growth of the corals
a<00:04:33.119> bit<00:04:33.419> like<00:04:33.539> your<00:04:33.659> alkalinity<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.550> they<00:04:35.550> both

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
a bit like your alkalinity and they both

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.699 
a bit like your alkalinity and they both
work<00:04:36.029> hand-in-hand<00:04:36.599> together<00:04:36.959> really

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:37.709 
work hand-in-hand together really

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:39.859

there's no point having a really high
calcium<00:04:53.399> and<00:04:53.879> then<00:04:54.089> your<00:04:54.300> ability<00:04:54.629> and<00:04:55.199> your

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
calcium and then your ability and your

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.339 
calcium and then your ability and your
magnesium<00:04:55.860> are<00:04:56.490> really<00:04:57.330> low<00:04:57.569> it's<00:04:57.929> just<00:04:58.139> not

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
magnesium are really low it's just not

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.129 
magnesium are really low it's just not
going<00:04:58.529> to<00:04:58.649> get<00:04:58.800> no<00:04:59.429> results<00:04:59.969> so<00:05:00.029> you<00:05:00.479> do<00:05:00.929> need

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
going to get no results so you do need

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.169 
going to get no results so you do need

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.730 
magnesium and strontium it will maintain
you<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.039> magnesium<00:05:14.459> so<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.779> find<00:05:16.080> yourself<00:05:16.199> I

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
you in magnesium so you find yourself I

find myself with this well I'm not

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.749 
find myself with this well I'm not
having<00:05:18.779> to<00:05:18.869> put<00:05:19.080> much<00:05:19.289> of<00:05:19.499> the<00:05:19.649> ions<00:05:20.219> in<00:05:20.429> at<00:05:20.550> all

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
having to put much of the ions in at all

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.850 
having to put much of the ions in at all
because<00:05:21.509> I<00:05:21.779> am<00:05:21.929> putting<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:22.349> small<00:05:22.559> trace

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
because I am putting a small trace

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.409 
because I am putting a small trace
element<00:05:23.279> of<00:05:23.369> it<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.610> every<00:05:23.789> time<00:05:24.059> I<00:05:24.240> add

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
element of it in every time I add

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.699 
element of it in every time I add
calcium<00:05:25.610> okay<00:05:26.639> game<00:05:27.449> with<00:05:27.599> this<00:05:27.719> one<00:05:27.929> test<00:05:28.529> it

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:28.709 
calcium okay game with this one test it

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:29.749 
calcium okay game with this one test it
first

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
first

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.969 
first
if<00:05:30.119> you're<00:05:30.330> low<00:05:30.509> you<00:05:31.019> add<00:05:31.169> your<00:05:31.319> calcium<00:05:31.559> trace

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
if you're low you add your calcium trace

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.739 
if you're low you add your calcium trace
element<00:05:32.429> don't<00:05:32.849> just<00:05:33.089> go<00:05:33.269> put<00:05:33.479> an<00:05:33.569> in

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.749 
element don't just go put an in

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:35.989 
element don't just go put an in
willy-nilly<00:05:34.189> because<00:05:35.189> you<00:05:35.369> could<00:05:35.579> be<00:05:35.699> put<00:05:35.879> in

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:35.999 
willy-nilly because you could be put in

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:39.439 
willy-nilly because you could be put in
one<00:05:36.300> level<00:05:36.569> something<00:05:37.319> up<00:05:37.499> really<00:05:37.800> high<00:05:38.449> and

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
one level something up really high and

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.569 
one level something up really high and
then<00:05:39.599> it's<00:05:39.749> really<00:05:40.019> hard<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.829> get<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.309> others

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:41.579 
then it's really hard to get the others

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:44.359 
then it's really hard to get the others
back<00:05:41.729> in<00:05:42.240> in<00:05:42.509> line<00:05:42.839> with<00:05:43.050> each<00:05:43.139> other<00:05:43.379> so<00:05:44.099> it's

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:44.369 
back in in line with each other so it's

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:46.369 
back in in line with each other so it's
best<00:05:44.610> to<00:05:44.729> just<00:05:44.819> do<00:05:45.149> a<00:05:45.180> little<00:05:45.509> bit<00:05:45.659> of<00:05:45.689> time<00:05:45.990> and

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
best to just do a little bit of time and

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.449 
best to just do a little bit of time and
add<00:05:46.829> in<00:05:46.979> that<00:05:47.129> way<00:05:47.749> you<00:05:48.749> can<00:05:49.019> use<00:05:49.459> calcium

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:50.459 
add in that way you can use calcium

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.779 
add in that way you can use calcium
reactors<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.419> cogs<00:05:51.629> whackers<00:05:52.110> huasos<00:05:52.789> it's

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
reactors and cogs whackers huasos it's

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.959 
reactors and cogs whackers huasos it's
another<00:05:54.089> form<00:05:54.719> of<00:05:55.019> adding<00:05:55.589> these<00:05:56.159> elements<00:05:56.399> in

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
another form of adding these elements in

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.139 
another form of adding these elements in
I<00:05:57.360> don't<00:05:58.319> I<00:05:58.499> soon<00:05:58.860> her<00:05:58.979> a<00:05:59.009> test<00:05:59.339> for<00:05:59.579> it<00:05:59.639> and<00:05:59.939> put

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:00.149 
I don't I soon her a test for it and put

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.079 
I don't I soon her a test for it and put
it<00:06:00.269> in<00:06:00.389> ice<00:06:00.569> and<00:06:00.749> when<00:06:00.839> it's<00:06:00.959> needed<00:06:02.089> because

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
it in ice and when it's needed because

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.909 
it in ice and when it's needed because
sometimes<00:06:03.719> you<00:06:03.839> can<00:06:04.019> set<00:06:04.229> something<00:06:04.439> cut<00:06:04.740> for

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
sometimes you can set something cut for

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.499 
sometimes you can set something cut for
a<00:06:04.949> while<00:06:05.189> and<00:06:05.399> it<00:06:05.490> will<00:06:05.610> work<00:06:05.789> Wow<00:06:06.059> and<00:06:06.419> then

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
a while and it will work Wow and then

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.480 
a while and it will work Wow and then
you<00:06:06.629> go<00:06:06.809> and<00:06:06.929> test<00:06:07.169> it<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:07.469> a<00:06:07.529> few<00:06:07.709> months<00:06:08.069> a

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
you go and test it and a few months a

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.139 
you go and test it and a few months a
week<00:06:09.089> or<00:06:09.240> two<00:06:09.389> later<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:10.110> it's<00:06:10.800> it's<00:06:11.399> changed

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
week or two later and it's it's changed

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:14.209 
week or two later and it's it's changed
it's<00:06:12.329> all<00:06:12.479> things<00:06:12.629> all<00:06:12.929> you<00:06:13.050> just<00:06:13.169> only<00:06:14.069> get

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
it's all things all you just only get

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.679 
it's all things all you just only get
better<00:06:14.459> results<00:06:14.849> with<00:06:14.939> just<00:06:14.999> liquid<00:06:15.360> trace

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
better results with just liquid trace

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.579 
better results with just liquid trace
elements<00:06:16.229> it<00:06:16.409> works<00:06:16.619> for<00:06:16.829> me<00:06:18.199> some<00:06:19.199> people<00:06:19.469> use
