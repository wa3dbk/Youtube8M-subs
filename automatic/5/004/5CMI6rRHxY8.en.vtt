00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.009
 but everyone here there is money in a new 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:11.030
 anchor video in which I'm going to do 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.500
 a reduction called xp bank and from what 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 so in this good way add two new 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 objects that are east and east 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 how good the character puts it in the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.020
 page so you do not need to put it on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.140
 the same link is left of this song if 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.699
 arrives to worry 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.520
 and well these floating trunks serve 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.010
 to accumulate our experience in case 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.720
 we have to go something 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.690
 catch or something 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.930
 and so we do not lose it in a kill and you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.630
 I will explain how good I have taken here a 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 Lots of experience to teach something 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.450
 22 web levels 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.880
 to see here we have 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.110
 this post is to teach them then a 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.900
 later cause good energy 10% in the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.610
 percentage of experience we want 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.220
 accumulate feel for example 28 by 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.830
 hundred then we give you store and it goes 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.810
 putting 28 percent then for 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.810
 take it out we give it to window 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.930
 and if we want 1% we are going to have to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.330
 make 2020 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 it's quite a 1% 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.030
 but good to see we're going to pick it up all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.940
 and why then all here 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.620
 and then others here good this one has another 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.690
 this is copper 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 different a little more expensive you know with 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.860
 now and this is the one that entails t 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.430
 and good that if we look at ourselves with 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.750
 feel like we have here experience 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.750
 in the limit there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.840
 Well, here we do not have anything here 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.420
 it is already but if we put your 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.370
 experience here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.630
 It is the same with the nights 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.910
 where we have it here 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.960
 and it's the only difference between 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.500
 between these and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.110
 winds 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.070
 and well this is very simple but 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 quite useful the truth and leave the link 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.850
 that the hobby and the textures pack 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.850
 this one that would fit I really liked it 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.400
 and good is a radio so short because 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.480
 I'm gonna walk through another medium like that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.520
 what good guys I hope you have 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.840
 liked watching videos been subscribe 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.459
 dalai poquitos 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.459
 and it's coming bye bye
