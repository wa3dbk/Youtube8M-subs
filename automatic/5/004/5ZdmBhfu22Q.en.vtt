00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
natural movement element of our game

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
natural movement element of our game
will<00:00:58.230> change<00:00:58.260> watch<00:00:59.190> expert<00:00:59.550> from<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> genre

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and we don't want to sacrifice any of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
and we don't want to sacrifice any of
its<00:01:02.430> potential<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:03.120> releasing<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.690> too<00:01:04.019> early

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
its potential by releasing it too early

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.070 
its potential by releasing it too early
so<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.930> kind

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
so they just want to actually was kind
of<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.409> Willie<00:01:07.770> McGee<00:01:08.100> far<00:01:08.580> clearly

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
of thing by Willie McGee far clearly

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
of thing by Willie McGee far clearly
that's<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.590> reason<00:01:10.619> why<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> game

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that's actually the reason why the game

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's actually the reason why the game
has<00:01:11.729> been<00:01:11.939> delayed<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> game<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.340> new<00:01:14.549> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
has been delayed so the game is new on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
has been delayed so the game is new on
coming<00:01:15.060> 2014<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:16.170> won't<00:01:16.380> America<00:01:16.740> give<00:01:16.920> me

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
coming 2014 they won't America give me

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
coming 2014 they won't America give me
from<00:01:17.159> better<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.000> coming<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.360> in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
from better so it's like coming out in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.410 
from better so it's like coming out in
February<00:01:19.290> 2015<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.520> isn't<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.970> under<00:01:21.360> a

are<00:02:01.610> actually<00:02:01.700> pretty<00:02:01.909> sad<00:02:02.210> about<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.540> year

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
are actually pretty sad about this year

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.529 
are actually pretty sad about this year
delay<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.680> at<00:02:04.369> least<00:02:04.549> we<00:02:04.880> will<00:02:05.119> be<00:02:05.270> getting<00:02:05.360> a

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
delay but at least we will be getting a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.260 
delay but at least we will be getting a
better<00:02:05.720> game<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.640> doesn't<00:02:07.970> really<00:02:08.030> matter

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
better game so it doesn't really matter

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.029 
better game so it doesn't really matter
if<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.509> game<00:02:08.660> also<00:02:08.840> later<00:02:09.140> not<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.590> lot<00:02:09.950> of

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
if the game also later not a lot of

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.440 
if the game also later not a lot of
games<00:02:10.190> get<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.459> light<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.910> they<00:02:11.000> are<00:02:11.090> me

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
games get to light and they are me

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
games get to light and they are me
better<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.050> dying<00:02:12.860> light<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.190> one<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.489> these

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
better so dying light is one of these

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.910 
better so dying light is one of these
here<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> games<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:15.380> year<00:02:15.500> delight<00:02:15.800> is

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
here the games so this year delight is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.580 
here the games so this year delight is
actually<00:02:16.280> bother<00:02:16.550> me<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.840> want<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.290> really

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
actually bother me I just want a really

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
actually bother me I just want a really
good<00:02:18.860> game<00:02:19.040> which<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:20.120> will<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.269> really

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
good game which I think will be really

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.150 
good game which I think will be really
fun<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:21.380> dying<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:21.950> would<00:02:22.100> be

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
fun and I think dying like would be

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.890 
fun and I think dying like would be
probably<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> best<00:02:22.940> games<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.750> I'll

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
probably one of the best games that I'll

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.080 
probably one of the best games that I'll
actually<00:02:24.050> ever<00:02:24.319> play<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.459> love<00:02:25.760> zombie
