display<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.340> change<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> an

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
display I can also change that to an

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.860 
iPad 2 and I can change the viewing
percentage<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.230> iPad<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> 75%

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870

percentage so I'm gonna go iPad to 75%
and<00:00:58.699> that's<00:00:59.699> how<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> create<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and that's how I'm going to create so

going across the top here again I can
jump<00:01:03.449> between<00:01:03.629> layers<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.739> jump<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> my

jump between layers here jump to my

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
jump between layers here jump to my
background<00:01:05.700> layer<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.600> loading<00:01:06.960> layer<00:01:07.140> if

background layer or my loading layer if
I<00:01:08.189> wanted<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> change<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> elements

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

there I'm just gonna stay right here on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
there I'm just gonna stay right here on
page<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.850> ever<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
page one if I ever want to go back to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.249 
page one if I ever want to go back to
see<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> thumbnail<00:01:13.590> view<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:15.810> click<00:01:15.930> over

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
see that thumbnail view I can click over

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.039 
see that thumbnail view I can click over
view<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.490> add<00:01:17.820> new<00:01:18.299> pages<00:01:18.630> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
view now I can also add new pages so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
view now I can also add new pages so
this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> very<00:01:19.500> similar<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.369> keynote<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this is very similar to keynote in the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.789 
this is very similar to keynote in the
way<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.780> add<00:01:21.930> slides<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> deck

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
way that you would add slides to a deck

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.670 
way that you would add slides to a deck
I<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.340> add<00:01:23.759> pages<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.200> you're<00:01:25.350> using

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I can add pages or if you're using

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.219 
I can add pages or if you're using
tumult<00:01:26.460> hype<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.420> believe<00:01:27.930> they're<00:01:28.049> called

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
tumult hype I believe they're called

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
tumult hype I believe they're called
scenes<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.030> hype<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.810> very<00:01:30.990> similar<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
scenes in hype so it's very similar to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
scenes in hype so it's very similar to
adding<00:01:31.470> scenes<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
adding scenes here so this is going to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
adding scenes here so this is going to
create<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.450> interactivity<00:01:34.020> between<00:01:34.350> pages

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
create some interactivity between pages

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.350 
create some interactivity between pages
so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.340> create<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.579> buttons<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> will

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so you can create some buttons that will

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
so you can create some buttons that will
link<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.439> page<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:37.979> page<00:01:38.159> three<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
link you to page two and page three so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
link you to page two and page three so
if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> want<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.630> rid<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
if you want to get rid of one you just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
if you want to get rid of one you just
have<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.770> highlighted<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.549> hit<00:01:41.820> delete

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
have it highlighted you can hit delete

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
have it highlighted you can hit delete
so<00:01:42.329> I'll<00:01:42.450> keep<00:01:42.570> two<00:01:42.780> pages<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.409> again

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
so I'll keep two pages on there again

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
so I'll keep two pages on there again
I'm<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.579> double<00:01:44.820> click<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.210> page<00:01:45.479> one

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I'm just gonna double click on page one

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870 
I'm just gonna double click on page one
and<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> sends<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.439> back<00:01:46.649> open<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> edit<00:01:47.670> page

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and that sends me back open to edit page

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510 
and that sends me back open to edit page
one<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.110> lower<00:01:49.259> left-hand<00:01:49.560> corner<00:01:49.710> my

this widget objects are some of the
standard<00:01:58.020> pre-built<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:59.270> guess<00:02:00.409> objects<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
standard pre-built I guess objects that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
standard pre-built I guess objects that
you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.860> throw<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:02.700> widget<00:02:03.090> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you can throw on to your widget to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.679 
you can throw on to your widget to
create<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> interactivity

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
create a little bit of interactivity

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.469 
create a little bit of interactivity
actions<00:02:06.689> are<00:02:07.310> things<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:08.789> objects<00:02:09.390> are

actions are things that your objects are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 
actions are things that your objects are
going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.280> layer

going to do and then you can layer

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to do and then you can layer
things<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600

only layer that we have aside from the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.150 
only layer that we have aside from the
actual<00:02:19.830> widget<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.090> background<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.410> if

of this project that I could come in and
create<00:02:38.130> some<00:02:38.430> code<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:40.020> then<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.260> any

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
create some code for and then at any

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.340 
create some code for and then at any
time<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.830> preview<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.340> widget<00:02:42.350> inspector

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
time I can preview my widget inspector

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
time I can preview my widget inspector
is<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:43.890> similar<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.370> any<00:02:44.970> other<00:02:45.060> inspector

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
is very similar to any other inspector

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750 
is very similar to any other inspector
that<00:02:45.840> helps<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.350> change<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.980> look<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.580> feel

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that helps you change the look and feel

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.020 
that helps you change the look and feel
of<00:02:47.930> whatever<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.710> selected<00:02:50.160> and

of whatever is you have selected and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.760 
of whatever is you have selected and
then<00:02:51.150> finally<00:02:51.510> action<00:02:51.930> lists<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.650> is

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
then finally action lists so this is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.150 
then finally action lists so this is
going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.790> your<00:02:54.630> timeline

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
going to be kind of like your timeline

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280 
going to be kind of like your timeline
that<00:02:56.160> would<00:02:56.460> say<00:02:57.210> when<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.660> click<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.170> an

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
that would say when you click on an

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.280 
that would say when you click on an
object<00:02:58.430> start<00:02:59.430> doing<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.850> action<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> I'll

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
object start doing this action so I'll

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
object start doing this action so I'll
just<00:03:01.470> click<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.370> let's<00:03:02.820> start

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
just click off of that and let's start

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.010 
just click off of that and let's start
by<00:03:03.240> adding<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.470> object<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.690> let's<00:03:06.690> start<00:03:06.930> in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
by adding in an object so let's start in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.500 
by adding in an object so let's start in
by<00:03:07.230> adding<00:03:07.590> an<00:03:07.710> HTML<00:03:09.560> box<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:12.210> do<00:03:12.360> this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
by adding an HTML box and so to do this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.660 
by adding an HTML box and so to do this
this<00:03:12.990> is<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> nice

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
this is going to be one of the nice

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.550 
this is going to be one of the nice
things<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.000> teachers<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.510> believe<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.990> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
things for teachers I believe is that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.730 
things for teachers I believe is that
you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.280> grab<00:03:17.820> an<00:03:18.150> embed<00:03:18.600> code<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:18.930> iframe

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
you can grab an embed code and iframe

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.860 
you can grab an embed code and iframe
from<00:03:20.160> pretty<00:03:20.580> much<00:03:20.610> anywhere<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.600> our<00:03:21.720> first

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
from pretty much anywhere so our first

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.690 
from pretty much anywhere so our first
example<00:03:22.050> will<00:03:22.500> use<00:03:22.740> just<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.130> youtube<00:03:23.520> video

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
example will use just a youtube video

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.150 
example will use just a youtube video
and<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.180> can<00:03:24.360> drop<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:25.860> if<00:03:26.070> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
and we can drop that in there so if I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.880

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
my brush is set to be white so I can

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.810
