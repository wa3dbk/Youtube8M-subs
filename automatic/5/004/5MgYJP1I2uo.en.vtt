00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 that a class has not been around for a long time 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.080
 A classic we already know that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 the generation change 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 but now everything is stale 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.390
 done because we get the a45 from 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 Amg have presented 265 kw of power 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 and 450 newton meters torque around this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.279
 performance is now for the time being 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279
 experience 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 with the design of the new a class has 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 Mercedes all surprised by the circumstance 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 not only for the model in the middle 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 but also for the target group 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 The same applies to the h 45 amg he is the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.830
 new entry-level model of performance 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 brand of mercedes benz and should too 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.970
 especially for amg attract young buyers 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.970
 Anyway, he has good arguments 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.190
 the a45 amg contemplative brute 46 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.739
 seconds 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.180
 that's great sports car level that likes 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.729
 but also because of that it is the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 same software is 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.680
 Direct shift transmission is used as 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.890
 in sls amg has four liters capacity 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.780
 the a45 less than the sls amg all the more 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.229
 astonishing how the little one's strength 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.030
 unfolds clearly highlight number 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.789
 one is the motor, we've got one here 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 two-liter four-cylinder engine we with 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.259
 equipped with a twin scroll turbo 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 have and thus have managed that 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:37.679
 strongest four-cylinder unit worldwide 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.299
 represent with at least 265 kw 360 ps 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.950
 at the engine engineers have also 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.170
 A focus on efficiency and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.170
 cleanliness he already meets the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.709
 It enters into force in the second stage in 2017 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.659
 the euro-6 exhaust standard and should only 6 9 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.149
 liter super plus on 100 kilometers 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.970
 if you need the gas pedal with the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.520
 foot tip strokes and so it sounds 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.520
 if you forget all restraint 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.239
 depending on the situation and driver 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 For example, on the race track 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.390
 Can the esb in the sport handling mode 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.190
 or even shut off but as well 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 under everyday conditions are the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.950
 extremely dynamic driving performance 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.750
 especially impressive 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.130
 acceleration from standstill 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 the top speed is 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.310
 electronically limited 250 km h 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.739
 the dynamism and power of the car for the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.050
 Experiencing drivers is also achieved 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.830
 high end tuner amg by one 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.830
 well-tried trick 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.320
 450 newtonmetres torque also want 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.350
 to be put on the street that is 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.120
 AMG has a permanent four-wheel drive 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.440
 installed so that we already here 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.660
 have possibility in curves 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.850
 vertex again right on the gas 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.720
 go without us having to be afraid 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 to fly out of the bend 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.640
 also visually shows the amg like what he 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.990
 can and does not promise too much 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.370
 muscular and sinewy lines 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.180
 from the apron over the strings 18 inches 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.160
 alloy wheels mirror housing in carbon look 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.810
 and amg high-performance brakes 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.250
 subtle hints that here 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.960
 Super athlete waiting for the start 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.790
 big air intakes and the so far for 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.740
 a great and typical long 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.340
 bonnet make the new generation 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.340
 a looker 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.770
 behind the tailgate shows the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.770
 sports car that he is also spacious 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.750
 But a lot of performance does not mean everyday 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.980
 unfriendly because we have 341 here 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.810
 liter luggage compartment volume 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.569
 do you work out the back seat to expand it 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:11.190
 in addition to 1,157 liters of 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.190
 suitcase to the interior 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.830
 the instrument panel is in carbon 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.990
 optics executed 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.780
 perfect to fit five ventilation nozzles 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.790
 in black and red that the sports seats only 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.570
 a leather replica are one notices 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.570
 not at all 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.180
 is switched over a seven-course 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.680
 automatic sports transmission the switching times 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.990
 can be divided into three driving programs 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.990
 comfort sport and vary manually 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.349
 amg has a lot of trouble with the sound 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.780
 given design 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.129
 So in the exhaust is an electronic 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.919
 controlled flap installed 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.099
 the floor and roar noises 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:20.540
 should and can prevent the compact 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.870
 super athletes convince our tester 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.180
 the a45 amg is not very cheap 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.800
 pleasure one must scarcely 50.000 euro on 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.770
 put the table but honestly 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.650
 who would like to compete with a class of 90 kw 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.790
 still drive if you once the 265 kw 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.790
 has experienced 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.560
 it could be at most financial 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.570
 finally fail is the a45 amg 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.570
 twice as expensive as the smallest class
