00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.030 
and if you're meant to have twins you
will<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:52.000> them<00:03:52.239> how<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.140> works<00:03:53.170> actually<00:03:53.829> in

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
will have them how it works actually in

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.660 
will have them how it works actually in
a<00:03:54.070> sweet<00:03:54.340> potato<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.910> has<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.739> compound<00:03:56.739> that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
a sweet potato it has this compound that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.710 
a sweet potato it has this compound that
acts<00:03:57.940> like<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.150> hormone<00:03:58.720> which<00:03:58.750> stimulates<00:04:00.720> FSH

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
acts like a hormone which stimulates FSH

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.020 
acts like a hormone which stimulates FSH
which<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.410> stands<00:04:02.799> for<00:04:03.070> follicle<00:04:03.700> stimulating

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
which is stands for follicle stimulating

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.210 
which is stands for follicle stimulating
hormone<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:05.350> what<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.739> follicle

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
hormone and what the follicle

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.160 
hormone and what the follicle
stimulating<00:04:06.400> hormone<00:04:06.760> does<00:04:07.359> is<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
stimulating hormone does is that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.470 
stimulating hormone does is that
stimulates<00:04:08.950> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
stimulates the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.920 
stimulates the
korie's<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.440> produce<00:04:10.709> more<00:04:11.400> than<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:11.909> only<00:04:12.269> so

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
korie's to produce more than one only so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.420 
korie's to produce more than one only so
it<00:04:13.050> increases<00:04:13.530> your<00:04:13.560> chances<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.250> having

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
it increases your chances of having

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.590 
it increases your chances of having
twins<00:04:16.070> dramatically<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.970> think<00:04:18.359> that's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
twins dramatically so I think that's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.170 
twins dramatically so I think that's
really<00:04:18.750> cool<00:04:19.019> nature's<00:04:19.620> way<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:20.180> controlling

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
really cool nature's way of controlling

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.010 
really cool nature's way of controlling
the<00:04:21.299> population<00:04:22.639> so<00:04:23.639> that's<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.300> clearly<00:04:24.630> as

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the population so that's a clearly as

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.850 
the population so that's a clearly as
far<00:04:25.260> as<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:26.580> medicinal<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.810> information<00:04:28.680> and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
far as the medicinal and information and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.439 
far as the medicinal and information and
me<00:04:29.010> check<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.400> now<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:29.910> want<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.389> the
