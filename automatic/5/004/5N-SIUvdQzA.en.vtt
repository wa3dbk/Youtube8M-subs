first tip is not to go into recruitment

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
first tip is not to go into recruitment
with<00:01:22.020> any<00:01:22.259> preconceived<00:01:22.920> notions<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.090> was

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with any preconceived notions if I was

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
with any preconceived notions if I was
you<00:01:24.390> guys<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.960> stay<00:01:25.229> away<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.500> going

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you guys I would stay away from going

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.640 
you guys I would stay away from going
online<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> looking<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:27.170> sororities<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
online and looking up sororities and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.510 
online and looking up sororities and
their<00:01:29.540> stereotypes<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.869> anything<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
their stereotypes or anything like that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
their stereotypes or anything like that
it's<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.090> negative<00:01:33.509> way<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.740> get

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's really just a negative way to get

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's really just a negative way to get
turned<00:01:35.310> off<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:35.729> houses<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> might

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
turned off from houses that you might

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.770 
turned off from houses that you might
actually<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.659> personally<00:01:39.659> went

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
actually really like I personally went

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.950 
actually really like I personally went
into<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> without<00:01:40.829> any<00:01:41.390> preconceived<00:01:42.390> notions

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
into it without any preconceived notions

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
into it without any preconceived notions
and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> best<00:01:44.130> thing

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and I think that that was the best thing

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
and I think that that was the best thing
that<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.880> could<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.200> things

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
solely on your own it's also good to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
solely on your own it's also good to
remember<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.680> house<00:01:58.860> has<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
remember that if a house has a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.999 
remember that if a house has a
reputation<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.600> being<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.930> top<00:02:01.170> house<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
reputation of being a top house that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
reputation of being a top house that
doesn't<00:02:02.340> necessarily<00:02:02.460> mean<00:02:03.270> you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
have<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> best<00:02:04.259> experience<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.640> stay

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
have the best experience so I would stay

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
have the best experience so I would stay
away<00:02:06.210> from<00:02:06.240> picking<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> house<00:02:06.990> based<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
away from picking a house based on it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.309 
away from picking a house based on it
being<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.220> top<00:02:08.520> house<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> high<00:02:09.479> house<00:02:09.750> I'd

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
being a top house or a high house I'd

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.260 
being a top house or a high house I'd
say<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.800> pick<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.580> feel<00:02:11.940> like

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
say just pick the one that you feel like

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.390 
say just pick the one that you feel like
you<00:02:12.420> fit<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> best

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you fit in the best

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.460 
you fit in the best

for<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.099> even<00:02:25.370> though<00:02:25.459> they<00:02:25.579> really<00:02:25.610> told<00:02:26.090> me

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
for them even though they really told me

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.759 
for them even though they really told me
later<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.569> they<00:02:26.840> did<00:02:27.049> feel<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.290> they<00:02:27.560> fit

in better at the other houses and they
both<00:02:30.019> really<00:02:30.439> regretted<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.040> because<00:02:31.400> they

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
both really regretted it because they

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.460 
both really regretted it because they
didn't<00:02:32.269> really<00:02:32.359> get<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.989> experience

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
didn't really get to have the experience

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.599 
didn't really get to have the experience
that<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:33.709> could<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:33.980> had<00:02:34.129> because<00:02:34.489> they

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
that they could have had because they

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.099 
that they could have had because they
were<00:02:34.640> basing<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.180> off<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.329> other<00:02:35.689> people's

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109
