00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello 60 frames per second this one 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.580
 of the most promising innovations in 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.610
 new generation games but really 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.540
 We need 60 fps on playstation 4 and 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.280
 xbox one 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.710
 well actually the answer to this question 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.050
 quite controversial some consider 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.270
 perhaps 30 frames per second is not enough 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.010
 sense, I still can not see 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.260
 the differences 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.689
 others think that my comp is already 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.420
 Supports games with 70 three horseradish oh 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.699
 us fps and so I almost this week 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.589
 sprained the brain by studying this topic so don't 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.359
 too much criticize unless we 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.359
 so we can get to the truth 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 when we watch digital video movies 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.600
 or the gameplay we observe extremely fast 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 changing a row of images each 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.699
 subsequent 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.739
 of which is slightly different from 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.780
 previous and it creates an impression 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.879
 natural movement so here if 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 frames per second i.e. fps 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 will fall below a certain number 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.449
 will become a jerk to find gradually we generally 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 can not see any movement, we 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.880
 can't even see the individual 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.040
 picture 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.259
 this is due to the effect that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 called the threshold of distinguishability flicker 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.250
 Image Have you ever noticed how in 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 the end of its life fluorescent 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.899
 and the light can flicker on 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 in fact she always twinkled just now 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.280
 flicker frequency dropped to visible 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.410
 your eyes level and that is the threshold 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.000
 discernibility of glimpses of the image and he 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.700
 varies by source 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.160
 for video and in general for most 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 people this threshold is about 17 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.170
 hertz in other words if the shift frequency 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 frames over 17 frames per second your 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.830
 the visual system will perceive 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.319
 what is happening on the screen as movement 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.750
 of course it can be especially smooth 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.579
 but none the less is enough than 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.500
 the more frames there will be the faster they 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.290
 will be replaced and the more smooth 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.270
 there will be movement but win and to i only 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.090
 that he took and replaced each other concept 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.229
 hertz and the number of frames per second 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.909
 the number of frames per second is 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.189
 the number of frames that gives 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.009
 source be it video card or media 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.869
 player hertz is the update frequency 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.790
 of your display so if your 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.350
 frames per second will be more 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.880
 than the refresh rate then those 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.670
 additional frames become 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.370
 redundant in fact it may even 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.650
 break the screen 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 so back to the good old 30 frames 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.910
 per second it is significantly greater than the threshold 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.190
 the visibility of the flickering of the image is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.200
 more than movies there are 24 frames in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 second and nobody except peter jackson on 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.459
 it does not complain so it should 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.890
 be more than enough for games not 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.709
 is it really so wrong 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.870
 just here we have to talk 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.170
 separately about the number of frames per second 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.500
 games and movies or digital video and on 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.480
 there are two good reasons first 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.310
 the game is a dynamic process unlike 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.410
 films where the process is passive so 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.920
 here it enclosed the response time and this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.870
 quite noticeable when he 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.420
 click on the action occurs 60 times a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.700
 second instead of 30 times per second because 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.709
 high fps can allow you faster 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.530
 react in the game making the game process 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.750
 more comfortable and secondly the lack 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.910
 motion blur if you put 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.950
 film on pause frame which you will see 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.930
 It will almost certainly be blurred it 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.700
 happens because when they take off 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.709
 film each frame is exhibited at 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480
 over a period of time and any 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.819
 movement in this period can be 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.950
 captured creep only blurry in 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.110
 the game however every single frame 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.060
 it displays perfect clear so what 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.370
 even if you take a screenshot during 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.350
 movement you get great clear 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.450
 image but the result is 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.250
 more twitched and reproducing since 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.900
 frames don't go over so naturally 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.780
 one to the other that's why most 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.630
 people can see the difference between 30 and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.580
 60 frames per second movement in the game 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.709
 actually more smoothly and look 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.660
 can you see the difference here 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.959
 we have 30 frames per second 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:59.230
 and now home as silk 60 frames in 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.880
 second and and it will be visible only if you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.709
 will watch this video on the website 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.510
 gamespot and player on youtube 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.350
 still plays only 30 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.940
 frames per second 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.100
 so if you watch the video on it 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.430
 I'm afraid the picture will seem identical to you 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.590
 by the way it's kind of like a science show even though i 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.079
 and so is not a bad scientist unsubstantiated 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.579
 words of little worth fortunately I found 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.709
 cool scientific work called 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.810
 the effect of frame rates and 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.490
 permissions to users playing in 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.830
 first-person shooters 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.570
 researchers studied 60 participants 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.510
 playing quake 3 with different frequency 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.610
 frame changes including 30 and 60 frames per 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.320
 second and what they saw is that 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.600
 game with a higher frequency of change 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.729
 frames had a big impact on how 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.100
 man played and what a pleasure nato 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.140
 He received from the game and so 60 frames in 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.550
 second definitely takes precedence 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.979
 on thirty but why then 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.410
 dwell on this why not 120 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.330
 frames per second or even more so 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.880
 well then with that guy who said 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.100
 sense i still can't see 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.470
 the difference is that everything here becomes 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.870
 difficult in the first place, this guy just 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.820
 is in ignorance as you know our 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.919
 visual system of the week all on the frames 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.180
 like a camera she gets a steady stream 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.620
 information going 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.600
 doctor forging the visual cortex 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.610
 I couldn't find a brain anywhere 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.259
 reliable information on what 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.940
 in fact, for us, the threshold of perception 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.860
 frames per second 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.750
 however, I think itâ€™s pretty clear that 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.509
 case the limiting factor is 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.400
 current hardware 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.410
 would be limited to the frequency of updating your 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.199
 monitor or tv what most 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.440
 people 1 to 60 hertz im or 120 hertz im 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.120
 for those who have 3d displays and so i'm 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.580
 eventually leaned toward that 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.650
 that 60 frames per second is perfect 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.840
 frame rate especially for 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.910
 new generation consoles don't get it 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.250
 me wrong 120 frames per second 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.960
 will give a smoother picture and give you 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.520
 reaction speed advantage 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.099
 but remember that there are not many people 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.900
 have need and iron besides rendering 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.280
 double frame rate strongly 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.800
 beats on performance 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.160
 and the new generation of consoles and its so 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.259
 not two in excess but let me know 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.680
 what do you think about it see you in 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.680
 next issue
