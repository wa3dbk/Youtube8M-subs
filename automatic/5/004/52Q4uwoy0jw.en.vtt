hydraulic<00:03:43.250> system<00:03:43.610> is<00:03:43.760> essentially<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.900> really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
hydraulic system is essentially a really

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.560 
hydraulic system is essentially a really
really<00:03:45.740> simple<00:03:46.430> system<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.880> pumps<00:03:47.120> oil<00:03:47.360> out<00:03:47.540> of

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
really simple system it pumps oil out of

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.410 
really simple system it pumps oil out of
a<00:03:47.720> tank<00:03:47.930> up<00:03:48.590> into<00:03:49.040> four<00:03:49.340> accumulators<00:03:50.060> and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
a tank up into four accumulators and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.150 
a tank up into four accumulators and
they<00:03:50.840> put<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:51.110> into<00:03:51.260> very<00:03:51.530> high<00:03:51.590> pressure<00:03:52.010> oil

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
they put it into very high pressure oil

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.480 
they put it into very high pressure oil
you<00:03:52.580> know<00:03:52.670> it's<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.650> 250<00:03:54.650> bar<00:03:55.010> and

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
you know it's like 250 bar and

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.430 
you know it's like 250 bar and
essentially<00:03:56.420> they<00:03:56.570> pumped<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:56.960> oil<00:03:57.230> in

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
essentially they pumped that oil in

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.840 
essentially they pumped that oil in
there<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.680> pump<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.310> against<00:03:58.610> nitrogen

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
there and pump it up against nitrogen

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.820 
there and pump it up against nitrogen
which<00:03:59.300> is<00:03:59.780> compressed<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.440> acts<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.710> a

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
which is compressed and acts like a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.420 
which is compressed and acts like a
spring<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.690> signal<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.860> oil<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.250> released

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
spring on a signal the oil is released

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.120 
spring on a signal the oil is released
and<00:04:04.820> runs<00:04:04.970> through<00:04:05.090> 32<00:04:05.540> hydraulic<00:04:06.230> motors<00:04:06.560> it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
and runs through 32 hydraulic motors it

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.850 
and runs through 32 hydraulic motors it
creates<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.730> zero<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.270> 120<00:04:08.780> mile<00:04:09.200> an<00:04:09.320> hour<00:04:09.410> line
