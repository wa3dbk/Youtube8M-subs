00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 and the fifth day of the race it was 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.090
 carried out the third and last route 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.710
 of the 87th six-day enduro 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 then tomorrow for the closure it will be the turn 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.950
 of the so-called final test which 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 this year we chose to carry out on 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.090
 mixed off-road asphalt inside 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.989
 of the circuit of the sachsenring headquarters of the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.580
 father 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.290
 today's track is the result 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.239
 simpler and shorter than the previous ones with 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 transfers almost entirely by road 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 and off-road sections limited to the sun 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.559
 special tests 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 Italy has made a good race 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.230
 consolidating the third place of class 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 at 6 pm the six days were presented 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 2013 that will take place in Sardinia olbia 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.659
 from 30 September to 5 October 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 let's listen to the voice of the 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.920
 micheluz captain how was there 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.870
 day today the organizers to a little 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.440
 of grace for the pilots seeing that after i 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.600
 two days of strikes today changed 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.610
 route and it was much easier there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.190
 several dirt roads because asphalt 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.190
 and so let's say it was one 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 day a little easier and the tests 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.240
 there were 4 specials per round, however, two 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.310
 beautiful selective and fast when young 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.649
 national team veteran like 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 judge the performance of your companions 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.700
 well veteran i still hope not seen 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.159
 that I'm not even 30 years old anyway 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.250
 I passed captain since I did 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.690
 this is my eighth day my days 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.590
 comrades say that they behaved 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.740
 very well we are third in the ranking of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.530
 consequently a good result seen i 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.679
 predictions unfortunately France is in a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.690
 moment of exalting form than not 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.110
 we can do anything against them 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:04.550
 australia is not very far but 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:07.310
 they were good franco gualdi 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 enduro national coordinator past the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.510
 fifth day we can take stock 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.120
 of Italy was above or below 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.330
 below your expectations 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.570
 I allow myself the expression mission 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.890
 accomplished great because 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.450
 an Italy third in the world trophy is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 one is a great success hoped for but 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.710
 difficult to reach and up to today 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.330
 we did it for which they have it 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.650
 made the pilots because then in the end they are 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.580
 always a good result for them 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.590
 and the victory is of the first day for the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.860
 junior did however understand of 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.860
 how much can youthful italy do for 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.260
 to which I repeat good mission accomplished 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.050
 to everyone and thanks to all of them anyway 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.700
 who participated in this trip 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.260
 in a few, however, the underline 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.390
 veteran of the Italian national team e 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.130
 micheluz who is less than 30 years old 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.490
 therefore also a young national in the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.490
 trophy 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.879
 yes i hear the name of michael use today 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.769
 seems to be a pilot with some 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.250
 another year he started going strong 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.470
 as a young man and is continuing to do so e 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.630
 despite this he is still a pilot 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.760
 very young 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.830
 and this this however not for per 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
 go and look for the why but anyway e 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.660
 as we said a young national 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.310
 which really gave the maximum ha 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.410
 given all he could and this is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.170
 really important they are committed 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.880
 and we are not spared we also say 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.830
 who have fun in a tough race 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.280
 because to the comments then during the evening 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.710
 they were always positive 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.600
 today we present the six days 2013 that 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.160
 the Italian federation will organize in 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.470
 sardinia therefore on one side must 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.910
 make an appointment for the fans on the other 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.570
 can you tell us as an organizer 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.400
 that if days will be next year 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.560
 surely the fans cannot miss 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.980
 in Italy they will not abandon us of 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.160
 sure indeed i'm sure they'll come 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.900
 from all parts of Italy but also of the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.760
 world because sardinia anyway 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
 interesting regardless of the enduro 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.630
 but he said this I have the results of 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.540
 this year they bode well for a 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.270
 result I wish you even better 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.480
 also for next year even if it is 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.070
 difficult to improve the ranking of 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.920
 trophy, however, goes well, in short, we will try 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.750
 and we will prepare ourselves adequately 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.550
 next year's race will have 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.740
 characteristics different from this one not 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.210
 will be a race with clearly with 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.100
 special tests with the long ones and so 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.530
 difficult because the land does not 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.280
 does not even allow but also because 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.350
 I honestly think it's useless to do 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.120
 of the days with the author and half as 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.150
 it happened here in germany it is not for 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.320
 to criticize is why we would miss it 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.830
 they organize six days and give hard 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.120
 so we don't look at these things but 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.980
 surely when we did one 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.380
 six-hour race are beautiful half 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.220
 right beautiful nice set with proofs 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.990
 special long the right minutes because 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.300
 it is not always by very long owners 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.950
 synonymous with quality for which a race 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.480
 all in all simple but certainly 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.920
 nice to see 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.410
 I hope not dominated but must be cut 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.530
 until the last ever on Saturday for 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.890
 which I believe we can enjoy that 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.870
 the fans must not repent 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.960
 to have chosen their vacation in 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.960
 Sardinia
