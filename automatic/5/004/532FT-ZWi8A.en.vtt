then or pie whatever and then you can
make<00:00:43.079> construction<00:00:43.980> lines<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.020> do

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
make construction lines and do

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
make construction lines and do
construction<00:00:46.620> lines<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.129> light<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
construction lines are very light the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
construction lines are very light the
end<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.100> eraser<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.620> took

end you do not need an eraser so I took

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.090 
end you do not need an eraser so I took
my<00:00:52.980> eraser<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.809> see<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:58.100> I'll

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
my eraser off see it's right here I'll

my eraser off see it's right here I'll
put<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.760> no<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.480> mechanical

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
put it back on no way this is mechanical

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.539 
put it back on no way this is mechanical
yes<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> drop

yes and then you have to drop

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.590 
yes and then you have to drop
construction<00:01:06.119> library<00:01:06.510> lightly<00:01:07.490> ok<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> then

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
construction library lightly ok and then

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
construction library lightly ok and then
you<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.840> another<00:01:10.260> construction<00:01:10.920> mine<00:01:11.310> right

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you do another construction mine right

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
you do another construction mine right
is<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> far<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.790> ok<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:15.930> got

is there so far so good ok and then got

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.789 
is there so far so good ok and then got
another<00:01:16.650> construction<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
another construction right down here you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.330 
another construction right down here you
see<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.689> another<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.680> right

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
see and then not to do another one right

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.630 
see and then not to do another one right
here<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:28.159> draw<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.430> little

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
here and then you have to draw a little

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
here and then you have to draw a little
um<00:01:30.650> oval<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.170> put

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
um oval right here right and just put

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.840 
um oval right here right and just put
this<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.729> I'll<00:01:35.939> show<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
then one on the other side you probably

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.249 
then one on the other side you probably
like<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.810> does<00:01:43.079> not

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
like what is this gonna just does not

like what is this gonna just does not
look<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.530> Pluto<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.369> trust<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.000> will

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
look like Pluto will trust me it will

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
look like Pluto will trust me it will
and<00:01:45.979> then<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.829> then<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and then you go like this and then you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.789 
and then you go like this and then you
have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> draw<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.509> oval<00:01:52.140> shape<00:01:52.439> like

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
have to draw a little oval shape like

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
have to draw a little oval shape like
this<00:01:55.159> make<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> draw<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this make there and then you draw a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
this make there and then you draw a
shine<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.860> exert<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.659> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
shine in it like that exert and then you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690 
shine in it like that exert and then you
color<00:02:03.990> around<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.590> shine<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
color around the shine but not on the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
color around the shine but not on the
Shrike<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> color<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> shine<00:02:07.560> there

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
Shrike if you color on the shine there

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.270 
Shrike if you color on the shine there
it<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.610> look<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> blob<00:02:09.590> enough<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.979> put

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it will look like a blob enough and put

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
it will look like a blob enough and put
up<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> poop<00:02:12.300> done<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.690> no

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
up with look like a poop done is no

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.980 
up with look like a poop done is no
and<00:02:15.010> then<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.490> now<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.120> drive<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.720> little

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
and then you now you drive this little

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.220 
and then you now you drive this little
shape<00:02:17.230> right<00:02:17.560> here<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.330> same<00:02:20.050> on

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
shape right here like that and same on

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.800 
shape right here like that and same on
the<00:02:20.380> other<00:02:20.410> side<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.690> then<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the other side like this and then you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
the other side like this and then you
just<00:02:23.020> debris<00:02:23.260> whiskers<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.280> each<00:02:24.940> side<00:02:26.580> look

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
just debris whiskers on each side look

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.440 
just debris whiskers on each side look
at<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.970> take<00:02:31.209> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
at that and then you have to take the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650 
at that and then you have to take the
tongue<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.140> then<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.590> draw<00:02:32.860> like<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.660> look

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
tongue and then you draw like this look
