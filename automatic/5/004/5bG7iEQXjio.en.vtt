00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.190
 buyincoins website take pictures of their 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.540

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.780
 see your orders 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 secondly he writes the parcel number even 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:49.390
 if I just have them 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.489
 encoding hour show now see yes here 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.340
 so the encoding is obtained on each 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.500
 simple parcel and for this parcel i 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.800
 just looked what it is with the bank 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.210

 I don't remember what color I ordered there 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.640
 now we will see with you they were worth 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.560
 about 16 dollars on aliexpress such 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 there is but they are worth more expensive there therefore 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.319
 decided to buy 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.229
 Finally, and I did not need them urgently 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.929
 so I knew very well that with the bank 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.240
 of the end since the mad less 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.190

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.200
 time of transportation 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.360

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.410
 critical so let's see how they 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.299
 three mini-finger batteries work 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:05.760

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.260
 I took three batteries from my remote control 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.209
 Tele because I did not know another type 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.359
 us a little box without any buttons in front 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:29.030
 behind here is such a department for 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.850
 batteries here are three mini-finger inputs 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.819
 here we have shurik 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.670
 the computer can turn on or buy 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.209
 Still in China, here you can charge for 220 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.170
 yusb stuck here for and they charge 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.930
 don't charge let it work for you from 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.920
 network is hardly any battery 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.440
 there is he principle is not needed here yes 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.980
 three buttons but buttons I have not yet 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.580
 I do not yet include, let's go together 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.970
 We will include with you and see what it is 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.060
 for the miracle of the Chinese technology otherwise 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.060
 will call 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.800
 the Chinese are generally great with them of course 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:20.769
 fantasy 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.769
 wow you look like you a 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.360
 zashib see now you are sad one 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.280
 the battery itself is not interesting 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.770
 I do not know how they are and here 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.500
 pasted some kind of film just like 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.540
 tree and there behind it the LEDs are old what 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.340
 they just shine through the film and the hub 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.150
 have mean show time and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.410
 apartment temperature 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:54.460
 here probably go setting alarm 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.120
 you can probably put degrees 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.190
 Fahrenheit and Celsius and this time 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:10.600
 set up yes everything is clear and the alarm clock 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:13.060
 this settings are all like this 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.330
 the clock is wonderful of course very 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:22.000
 quite good turn it on and off 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:24.280
 here it will be better seen in principle what 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.250
 say first it's not me buying me 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.800
 just asked them to buy the bottom was not 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.960
 personally it is interesting to check that it is 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.720
 This look because in the commercials I 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.410
 would see but nevertheless it would be cool 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.800
 see live what it is honest 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.050
 I will say and here probably stuck here the show 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.590
 small i mean i want you 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.450
 say the principle is very nice parts for 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.190
 16 dollars with us I have not seen such but 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.800
 if they stand you attack on the table 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.510
 turned off yes then of course nobody even 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.490
 guess it's just a watch 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.860
 board 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.440
 so of course the purchase is worth it 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.700
 definitely 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.410
 I will watch I will learn the settings I 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.190
 I think it's not difficult what is all in principle 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:17.190
 watch all he wanted to show here 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:21.540
 such here is a watch link active under video 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:24.090
 so of course you will buy 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.440
 happiness because the hour is really 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.210
 cool and it is possible that is all who will 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.190
 coming to you and watching of course will 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.450
 be surprised because the clock 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.040
 Well, the watches are not bad and they have their own 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.580
 zest like this here 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.950
 wooden bar here we have a watch 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.890
