00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
angle to the line throughout this whole

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.370 
angle to the line throughout this whole
stroke<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.690> practice<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
Lesson number one so here we're going to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.240 
Lesson number one so here we're going to
hold<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.149> pen<00:00:39.870> again<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.100> going

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
hold the pen again like this it's going

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:56.319 
hold the pen again like this it's going
to<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.940> constant<00:00:43.640> line<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.579> up

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.470 

okay<00:00:57.050> make<00:00:57.320> sure<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:58.040> whole<00:00:58.340> top<00:00:58.820> of<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.180> pen

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
okay make sure the whole top of the pen

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.660 
okay make sure the whole top of the pen
touches<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.260> paper<00:01:00.440> throughout<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.309> whole

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
touches the paper throughout this whole

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.380 
touches the paper throughout this whole
stroke<00:01:02.470> okay<00:01:03.470> sometimes<00:01:03.949> when<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.339> move<00:01:04.970> your

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
stroke okay sometimes when you move your

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.000 
stroke okay sometimes when you move your
hand<00:01:05.630> around<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.470> part<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:08.170> gets<00:01:09.170> above<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
hand around so part of it gets above the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.910 
hand around so part of it gets above the
paper<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.990> stroke<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.470> different

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
paper and then the stroke is different

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:25.390 
paper and then the stroke is different
okay<00:01:13.759> so<00:01:13.820> let's<00:01:14.240> do<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.479> again

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.450 

keep<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.330> all<00:01:26.570> parallel<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.040> each<00:01:28.130> other

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
keep this all parallel one to each other

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.890 
keep this all parallel one to each other
and<00:01:31.060> we<00:01:32.060> can<00:01:32.210> always<00:01:32.510> add<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.930> dot<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.590> top

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
and we can always add a dot on the top

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.330 
and we can always add a dot on the top
that<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.140> also<00:01:36.320> learned<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.100> previous

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340
