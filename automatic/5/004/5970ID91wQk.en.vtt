00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone my name is Nina and I again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 glad to welcome you on my channel 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.460
 and today I want to perform a video on demand 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 tell about your collection of perfumes on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.530
 in fact, I donâ€™t have a lot of perfumes 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.500
 not a lot of perfume and toilet water 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.460
 only six of these are likely to be me 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.529
 use it anyway more often 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 well let's start with my most beloved 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.289
 toilet water it or par kenzo 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 this fragrance is very gentle marine 9 his 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.529
 envelops 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.510
 the cloud is very soft and very light 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.930
 it smells very persistent and in 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 aroma composition all the freshest 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.550
 rosewood brazilian japanese lemon 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 dota fresh basil 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 musk mint that is all the most 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.370
 fresh all the most tender-I 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 like this smell because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 really holding on for a long time and not even 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.309
 one day and if i will be shoes there 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 for example your scarf this flavor tone 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.920
 the next day will also smell 2 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.530
 an aroma that I also really like 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.439
 it's interrupted by bruno banani 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 this flavor is warmer more mature 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.580
 field erotic flower and fruit smell 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 look freesia 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.439
 peony mongongo amber and vanilla this 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 the aroma is more evening it is like 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.320
 wraps its heat creates a very 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.939
 nice what vanilla train too 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 insanely beautifully and I am very 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.979
 like the packaging design is no longer 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 The first impasse we say so I very often 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.689
 white next two flavors want 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 show together I and showed earlier in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.890
 shopping is coconut and vanilla firms 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.649
 called resort neychural 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.540
 I will leave a link to the website at the bottom 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.830
 description 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.590
 sure it is very persistent home 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.870
 cute flavors actually or this one 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 the aroma smells like vanilla this aroma smells 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.730
 coconut is practically superfluous 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.640
 No, they are so sturdy that keeps neither 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.330
 one even a day and my sweaters if i 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.190
 let's put out these 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.410
 these smells smells smells put 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.890
 then they hold up to several days on 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.210
 really generally before washing but they are not 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.959
 like the fact that they are 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.459
 home very much though I basically love and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.620
 I love more sea flavors I don't like 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.330
 such 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.310
 there may be warm flavors so sweet 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.250
 flavors but it is not just conquered 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.830
 crazy and the world too often use and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 the last two flavors are fragrances from 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.100
 I too already told faberlik but an essence 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.320
 I repeat it and the press del amor 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.450
 and alatau and in the cutters for mur 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.450
 wonderful fruity aroma with notes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.850
 ylang ylang and roses and jasmine 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.340
 vanilla flavor is actually in medium 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.340
 resilience and during the day it comes 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.950
 still freshening put another scent 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.920
 very female so old and me 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.410
 like but most of all from faberlic to me 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.930
 and my mom, by the way, although the fragrances 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.190
 and more girlish like the flavor of alatau 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.940
 he is excellent 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.530
 he is fresh cutting at the same time holding on 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.050
 not bad too brides too 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.040
 probably four o'clock where is the act of aroma 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.040
 with notes of patchouli and amber pine lemon 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.830
 mint here are very light very pleasant and 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.930
 I repeat once again from faberlic probably 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.640
 one of my favorite but such 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.530
