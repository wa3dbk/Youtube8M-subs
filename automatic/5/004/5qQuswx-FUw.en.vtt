this is what I really want to focus on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
this is what I really want to focus on
tonight<00:02:36.870> rather<00:02:37.590> than<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.400> used<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> be

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
tonight rather than what used to be

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.390 
tonight rather than what used to be
called<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> nuts<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.569> bolts<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.010> sector

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
called the nuts and bolts of the sector

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
called the nuts and bolts of the sector
I<00:02:41.549> think<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.880> moved<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.569> think<00:02:42.870> everything

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I think it's moved on I think everything

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.250 
I think it's moved on I think everything
has<00:02:43.440> moved<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:44.010> actually<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.970> must<00:02:45.660> say<00:02:45.959> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
has moved on actually I must say that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.100 
has moved on actually I must say that
that<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> publisher<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.459> book<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:48.720> very

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
that the publisher of this book was very

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
that the publisher of this book was very
very<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.360> think<00:02:52.040> must<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.160> congratulated

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
very I think must be congratulated

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.190 
very I think must be congratulated
actually<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.350> basically<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.880> a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
actually for for basically going for a

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.570 
actually for for basically going for a
spiritual<00:02:58.200> approach<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.799> have<00:02:58.920> because

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
spiritual approach that you have because

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.759 
spiritual approach that you have because
it<00:02:59.730> is<00:03:00.239> quite<00:03:00.600> difficult<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.200> get<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.560> sort

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
it is quite difficult to get this sort

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.170 
it is quite difficult to get this sort
of<00:03:01.829> thing<00:03:02.040> published<00:03:02.519> by<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> commercial

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
of thing published by a commercial

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.170 
of thing published by a commercial
publisher<00:03:03.930> which<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.970> they

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
publisher which this is and then they

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.349 
publisher which this is and then they
basically<00:03:06.390> gave<00:03:07.230> no<00:03:07.530> limits<00:03:08.010> or<00:03:08.579> restrictions

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
basically gave no limits or restrictions

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.890 
basically gave no limits or restrictions
upon<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:12.150> kept<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:12.630> agree

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
upon it and they kept and they agree

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.420 
upon it and they kept and they agree
that<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.410> spiritual<00:03:14.100> inspiration

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that it would be a spiritual inspiration

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.150 
that it would be a spiritual inspiration
of<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> only<00:03:15.450> basis<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.140> will<00:03:16.620> write<00:03:16.829> yet

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
of the only basis that I will write yet

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.130 
of the only basis that I will write yet
another<00:03:17.519> book<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.660> are<00:03:18.750> quite<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> lot

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
another book and there are quite a lot

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.220 
another book and there are quite a lot
around<00:03:19.560> about<00:03:20.400> basic<00:03:21.209> ufology<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
around about basic ufology and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.900 
around about basic ufology and
government<00:03:22.859> cover-ups<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.459> get<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
government cover-ups and get it on the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.410 
government cover-ups and get it on the
Internet

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
Internet

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.849 
Internet
it's<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.620> deeper<00:03:26.100> questions<00:03:26.720> really

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
it's the deeper questions really

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.340 
it's the deeper questions really
fascinating<00:03:28.859> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
fascinating the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.170 
fascinating the
they<00:03:29.530> fascinate<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:31.770> so<00:03:32.770> not<00:03:33.490> only<00:03:33.700> have

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
they fascinate you so not only have

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.290 
they fascinate you so not only have
people<00:03:34.510> moved<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.140> relation<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> UFOs<00:03:36.400> but

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
people moved on in relation to UFOs but

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.240 
people moved on in relation to UFOs but
I<00:03:37.540> think<00:03:37.870> people<00:03:38.080> have<00:03:38.320> moved<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.710> in<00:03:38.860> relation

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
I think people have moved on in relation

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.940 
I think people have moved on in relation
to<00:03:39.280> many<00:03:39.580> things<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.630> one<00:03:40.960> thing<00:03:40.990> is<00:03:41.440> science

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
to many things and one thing is science

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.800 
to many things and one thing is science
now<00:03:42.130> I'm<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.550> scientist<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.330> put<00:03:43.540> my<00:03:43.630> hand

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
now I'm not a scientist I put my hand

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.000 
now I'm not a scientist I put my hand
right<00:03:43.900> up<00:03:44.170> right<00:03:44.380> away

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
a lot of physicists we may have science

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.110 
a lot of physicists we may have science
I<00:03:47.260> know<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.890> do<00:03:48.070> some<00:03:48.430> scientists<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:48.970> this

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120

science<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.160> going<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.760> would<00:04:16.120> say<00:04:16.390> it's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
science is going and I would say it's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.590 
science is going and I would say it's
going<00:04:16.660> towards<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.620> mystical<00:04:18.130> very<00:04:19.120> very

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
going towards the mystical very very

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.090 
going towards the mystical very very
markedly<00:04:20.140> indeed<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.210> take<00:04:22.480> for<00:04:22.720> example

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
markedly indeed if you take for example

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.420 
markedly indeed if you take for example
the<00:04:24.100> whole<00:04:25.560> approach<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.620> matter<00:04:27.840> they<00:04:28.840> want

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
the whole approach to matter they want

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.870 
the whole approach to matter they want
is<00:04:31.020> astrophysicists<00:04:32.880> theoretical

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
is astrophysicists theoretical

physicists<00:04:34.710> stayed<00:04:35.710> pretty<00:04:36.100> well

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
physicists stayed pretty well

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.940 
physicists stayed pretty well
generally<00:04:37.540> now<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:38.680> only<00:04:39.160> 4%<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:41.140> matter<00:04:41.650> in

is the matter which must exist because

there isn't enough gravity in the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.590 
there isn't enough gravity in the
universe<00:05:17.220> from<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.310> bodies<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:19.180> doesn't

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
universe the galaxies would fall apart

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.119 
universe the galaxies would fall apart
solar<00:05:25.000> systems<00:05:25.480> with

solar systems with

solar systems with
to<00:05:27.279> separate<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:29.199> wouldn't<00:05:29.619> continue<00:05:29.979> so<00:05:30.489> they

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
to separate it wouldn't continue so they

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.179 
to separate it wouldn't continue so they
done<00:05:30.819> that's<00:05:31.089> there<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:31.839> they<00:05:32.589> also<00:05:32.770> know

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
done that's there and they also know

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.209 
done that's there and they also know
that<00:05:33.429> the<00:05:33.550> universe<00:05:33.969> is<00:05:34.149> expanding<00:05:34.349> and<00:05:35.349> that

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
that the universe is expanding and that

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.909 
that the universe is expanding and that
requires<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.969> force<00:05:37.389> which<00:05:37.929> they<00:05:38.169> can't<00:05:38.469> detect

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
requires a force which they can't detect

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.709 
requires a force which they can't detect
and<00:05:39.339> that's<00:05:40.059> dark<00:05:40.360> energy<00:05:40.809> so<00:05:41.019> that<00:05:41.679> is<00:05:42.149> 96%<00:05:43.149> of

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
and that's dark energy so that is 96% of

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.669 
and that's dark energy so that is 96% of
the<00:05:43.959> matter<00:05:44.649> I<00:05:45.330> would<00:05:46.330> say<00:05:46.779> that<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.229> moving

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:47.679 
the matter I would say that is moving

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.529 
the matter I would say that is moving
towards<00:05:48.009> a<00:05:48.069> metaphysical<00:05:48.610> processor<00:05:49.269> because

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
towards a metaphysical processor because

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.379 
towards a metaphysical processor because
it's<00:05:49.659> not<00:05:49.809> physically<00:05:50.409> detected<00:05:51.389> interesting

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
it's not physically detected interesting

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.059 
it's not physically detected interesting
enough<00:05:52.599> I<00:05:52.719> will<00:05:52.839> say<00:05:53.019> also<00:05:53.469> straight<00:05:53.800> away

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
enough I will say also straight away

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.489 
enough I will say also straight away
that<00:05:54.309> dr.<00:05:54.969> King<00:05:55.239> or<00:05:55.449> Vivian<00:05:55.839> mentioned<00:05:56.349> who

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:56.499 
that dr. King or Vivian mentioned who

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:59.100 
that dr. King or Vivian mentioned who
was<00:05:56.979> my<00:05:57.219> teacher<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.849> master<00:05:58.360> owner<00:05:58.569> and<00:05:58.989> I've

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
was my teacher and master owner and I've

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.980 
was my teacher and master owner and I've
talked<00:05:59.349> about<00:05:59.469> quite<00:05:59.919> a<00:05:59.979> bit<00:06:00.039> tonight<00:06:00.719> when<00:06:01.719> he

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
talked about quite a bit tonight when he

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.820 
talked about quite a bit tonight when he
lectured<00:06:02.289> back<00:06:02.769> in<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.099> 50s<00:06:03.610> and<00:06:03.759> early<00:06:03.909> 60s

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
lectured back in the 50s and early 60s

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.929 
lectured back in the 50s and early 60s
made<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.860> point<00:06:06.249> which<00:06:06.519> was<00:06:06.699> very

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
made a point which was very

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.070 
made a point which was very
controversial<00:06:07.659> at<00:06:07.929> that<00:06:08.110> time<00:06:08.819> which<00:06:09.819> was

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
controversial at that time which was

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.419 
controversial at that time which was
that<00:06:12.389> life<00:06:13.389> on<00:06:13.749> the<00:06:14.080> other<00:06:14.289> realms<00:06:15.009> of<00:06:15.219> this

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:15.429 
that life on the other realms of this

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:18.809 
that life on the other realms of this
world<00:06:15.759> life<00:06:16.269> after<00:06:16.779> death<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.279> those<00:06:18.279> people

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
world life after death to those people

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.699 
world life after death to those people
in<00:06:19.149> the<00:06:19.179> heavenly<00:06:19.749> spheres<00:06:19.929> or<00:06:20.349> the<00:06:20.439> higher

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:20.709 
in the heavenly spheres or the higher

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:25.859 
in the heavenly spheres or the higher
realms<00:06:21.599> life<00:06:22.599> there<00:06:22.959> was<00:06:23.229> physical<00:06:24.539> he<00:06:25.539> says

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:25.869 
realms life there was physical he says

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.769 
realms life there was physical he says
quite<00:06:26.199> off<00:06:26.489> it's<00:06:27.489> as<00:06:27.699> physically<00:06:28.329> same<00:06:28.569> as

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:28.779 
quite off it's as physically same as

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.549 
quite off it's as physically same as
this<00:06:30.029> so<00:06:31.029> then<00:06:31.269> is<00:06:31.539> just<00:06:31.809> operating<00:06:32.110> on<00:06:32.529> a

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:32.559 
this so then is just operating on a

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.769 
this so then is just operating on a
higher<00:06:32.860> frequency<00:06:33.129> and<00:06:33.759> that<00:06:33.819> is<00:06:34.179> really

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
higher frequency and that is really

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.729 
higher frequency and that is really
where<00:06:35.379> science<00:06:36.039> is<00:06:36.159> moving
