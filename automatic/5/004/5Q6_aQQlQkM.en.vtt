welcome to PC which gets tech talk today
we're<00:00:13.200> looking<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.469> something<00:00:13.799> new<00:00:13.980> from

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
we're looking at something new from

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.550 
we're looking at something new from
Arctic<00:00:14.610> cooling<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> freezer<00:00:15.960> extreme

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Arctic cooling it's the freezer extreme

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.630 
Arctic cooling it's the freezer extreme
reversion<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:20.039> CPU

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
reversion to now this one here is a CPU

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150 
reversion to now this one here is a CPU
cooler<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.330> reviewed<00:00:21.869> video<00:00:22.529> cards<00:00:22.920> that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
cooler but I reviewed video cards that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.859 
cooler but I reviewed video cards that
had<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.150> Arctic<00:00:25.109> cooling<00:00:25.529> fans<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.869> heat

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
had the Arctic cooling fans and heat

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
had the Arctic cooling fans and heat
sinks<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.220> be

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
sinks on it so it's going to be

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
sinks on it so it's going to be
interesting<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> review<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> CPU<00:00:30.570> cooler<00:00:30.929> today

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
interesting to review a CPU cooler today

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
interesting to review a CPU cooler today
now<00:00:31.710> looking<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> box<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> says<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
now looking at the box here it says that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
now looking at the box here it says that
it's<00:00:33.719> compatible<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.649> Intel<00:00:34.860> Core<00:00:35.040> i7

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it's compatible with the Intel Core i7

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.299 
it's compatible with the Intel Core i7
i-5<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.180> course<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> AMD<00:00:37.020> sockets<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.040> all

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
i-5 of course the AMD sockets so all

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.630 
i-5 of course the AMD sockets so all
your<00:00:38.489> AMD<00:00:38.730> CPUs<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.780> 160<00:00:40.739> watts<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.340> that's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
your AMD CPUs up to 160 watts so that's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549 
your AMD CPUs up to 160 watts so that's
terrific<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.020> using<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.410> with

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
terrific I'm going to be using this with

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
terrific I'm going to be using this with
the<00:00:43.680> six<00:00:43.920> core<00:00:44.129> processor<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.570> comes<00:00:45.750> pre

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the six core processor and it comes pre

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
the six core processor and it comes pre
applied<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.950> thermal<00:00:47.250> paste<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.730> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
applied with some thermal paste on it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
applied with some thermal paste on it
and<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.690> has<00:00:48.899> all<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.860> materials<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and it has all the materials that you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.720 
and it has all the materials that you
need<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> install<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.620> either<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.890> Intel<00:00:53.280> or

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
need to install it in either an Intel or

need to install it in either an Intel or
an<00:00:53.969> AMD<00:00:54.410> socket<00:00:55.410> board<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.430> worry<00:00:56.610> about

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
an AMD socket board so don't worry about

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
an AMD socket board so don't worry about
having<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> purchase<00:00:58.289> anything<00:00:58.500> else<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.250> fan

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
having to purchase anything else the fan

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
having to purchase anything else the fan
is<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.730> quite<00:01:00.149> quiet<00:01:00.449> only<00:01:01.230> goes<00:01:01.620> from

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
is actually quite quiet only goes from

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.630 
is actually quite quiet only goes from

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
800 to 1500 rpm there's what we've got

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
800 to 1500 rpm there's what we've got
in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> package<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.990> Intel<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.409> AMD<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in the package for Intel and AMD and the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
in the package for Intel and AMD and the
manual<00:01:08.510> straightforward<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:11.390> taking<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> look

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
manual straightforward and taking a look

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
manual straightforward and taking a look
at<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.130> pipes<00:01:14.400> there's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
at it here you can see the pipes there's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
at it here you can see the pipes there's
four<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> u-shape<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
four of them going in a u-shape down to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
four of them going in a u-shape down to
the<00:01:17.189> base<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the base and you can see that there's a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
the base and you can see that there's a
fan<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> middle<00:01:20.369> ok<00:01:21.030> sandwiched<00:01:21.570> in

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
fan in the middle ok sandwiched in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210 
fan in the middle ok sandwiched in
between<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> thermal<00:01:22.799> paste<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
between there's the thermal paste that I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
between there's the thermal paste that I
mentioned<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> comes<00:01:24.299> pre<00:01:24.540> applied<00:01:24.869> nice

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
mentioned that comes pre applied nice

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
mentioned that comes pre applied nice
copper<00:01:26.189> pipes<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.540> heat<00:01:28.020> transfer

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
copper pipes there so good heat transfer

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.880 
copper pipes there so good heat transfer
coming<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.439> course<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
coming in and and of course it has the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010 
coming in and and of course it has the
cable<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> power<00:01:33.119> management<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
cable for the power management of the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100 
cable for the power management of the
fan<00:01:34.530> power<00:01:34.950> managed<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> controlled<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
fan power managed and controlled and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.780 
fan power managed and controlled and
we're<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.600> using<00:01:39.600> obviously<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
we're going to be using obviously a

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
we're going to be using obviously a
bracket<00:01:41.790> okay<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.720> comes<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> bracket

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
bracket okay so it comes with a bracket

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
bracket okay so it comes with a bracket
that<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.430> depending<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that you would put on there depending on

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
that you would put on there depending on
the<00:01:45.180> type<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.540> CPU<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the type of CPU if you're using the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.819 
the type of CPU if you're using the
Intel<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.240> AMD<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.530> attach

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
Intel or the AMD then you would attach

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.380 
Intel or the AMD then you would attach
it<00:01:50.040> appropriately<00:01:50.579> there<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> sides<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it appropriately there to the sides and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
it appropriately there to the sides and
like<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.509> said<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> fan<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> actually<00:01:55.470> quite

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
like I said the fan is actually quite

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240 
like I said the fan is actually quite
easy<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.990> remove<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> wanted<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.100> only

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
easy to remove if you wanted the only

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.800 
easy to remove if you wanted the only
thing<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.460> didn't<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
thing I didn't like about it is that the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
thing I didn't like about it is that the
way<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> clips<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> flimsy

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
way it clips on it's a kind of flimsy

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
way it clips on it's a kind of flimsy
but<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:04.140> design<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:04.829> efficient

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but the design is very efficient

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
but the design is very efficient
actually<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.479> sandwich<00:02:07.110> design<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
actually this sandwich design with the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.410 
actually this sandwich design with the
fan<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> middle<00:02:08.520> works<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:09.030> here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
fan in the middle works very well here

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
fan in the middle works very well here
it<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> FN<00:02:10.860> out<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it is with the FN out so you can get a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.130 
it is with the FN out so you can get a
closer<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.629> mentioned<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.050> very

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
closer look like I mentioned it's very

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.250 
closer look like I mentioned it's very
quiet<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.140> results<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
quiet so I really like the results of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430 
quiet so I really like the results of
this<00:02:16.410> fan<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.910> end<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> design<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.170> just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
this fan and the end the design I just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.030 
this fan and the end the design I just
didn't<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.160> how<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:21.180> clips<00:02:21.900> okay<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> thought

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
didn't like how it clips okay I thought

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
didn't like how it clips okay I thought
that<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.520> way<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.420> clips<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.959> very

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that the way that it clips is very

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
that the way that it clips is very
flimsy<00:02:25.440> okay<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.150> could<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.360> done<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
flimsy okay and they could have done a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.970 
flimsy okay and they could have done a
better<00:02:27.629> job<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.319> attach<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.819> there<00:02:30.599> okay<00:02:31.290> as

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
better job to attach it on there okay as

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.030 
better job to attach it on there okay as
you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.550> here<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:32.879> took<00:02:33.030> off<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:34.040> plastic

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you can see here I took off the plastic

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.300 
you can see here I took off the plastic
covers<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.670> either<00:02:35.970> side<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.010> took

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
covers on either side and then I took

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.089 
covers on either side and then I took
out<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.810> fan<00:02:39.810> which<00:02:40.500> goes<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> middle

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
out the fan which goes in the middle

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.710 
out the fan which goes in the middle
there<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.670> need<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.910> actually<00:02:42.060> screw<00:02:42.540> in

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
there and you need to actually screw in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.479 
there and you need to actually screw in
two<00:02:43.019> screws<00:02:43.379> that's<00:02:43.980> why<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.220> need<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.459> take

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
two screws that's why you need to take

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.020 
two screws that's why you need to take
out<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> fan<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:46.280> let<00:02:47.280> me<00:02:47.370> show<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.550> briefly

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
out the fan so let me show you briefly

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
out the fan so let me show you briefly
here<00:02:48.420> what<00:02:48.599> I'm<00:02:48.690> talking<00:02:49.110> about

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
here what I'm talking about

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.729 
here what I'm talking about
will<00:02:49.950> install<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.700> my<00:02:51.110> my<00:02:52.110> test<00:02:52.349> system

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
will install it in my my test system

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.270 
will install it in my my test system
here<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.220> said<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:53.580> using<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.209> Intel<00:02:55.280> CPU

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
here like I said I'm using it Intel CPU

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.800 
here like I said I'm using it Intel CPU
sometimes<00:02:56.819> but<00:02:57.120> today<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.480> going<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.690> be

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
sometimes but today I'm going to be

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.540 
sometimes but today I'm going to be
using<00:02:58.140> an<00:02:58.260> AMD<00:02:58.849> 6<00:02:59.849> core<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.620> 1075<00:03:01.620> T<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.370> came

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
using an AMD 6 core the 1075 T that came

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.530 
using an AMD 6 core the 1075 T that came
out<00:03:02.700> recently<00:03:02.989> okay<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.519> I've<00:03:05.519> already<00:03:05.879> put

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
out recently okay and I've already put

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.050 
out recently okay and I've already put
the<00:03:06.720> CPU<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> board<00:03:07.830> applied<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.730> thermal

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the CPU on the board applied the thermal

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.119 
the CPU on the board applied the thermal
paste<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.260> next<00:03:10.470> thing<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.099> course

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
paste so the next thing to do of course

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.979 
paste so the next thing to do of course
is<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:12.239> install<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:14.000> CPU<00:03:15.000> cooler<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.750> we've

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
is to install the CPU cooler so we've

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.290 
is to install the CPU cooler so we've
got<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.319> fan<00:03:16.560> out<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.340> attached<00:03:17.700> these<00:03:18.090> two

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
got the fan out and I attached these two

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.990 
got the fan out and I attached these two
brackets<00:03:18.599> for<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.080> AMD<00:03:19.470> CPU<00:03:19.950> which<00:03:20.430> clip<00:03:20.790> on

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
brackets for the AMD CPU which clip on

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
brackets for the AMD CPU which clip on
to<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> motherboard<00:03:22.050> bracket<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.860> comes

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
to the motherboard bracket that comes

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.580 
to the motherboard bracket that comes
already<00:03:24.019> installed<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.200> your<00:03:25.319> motherboard

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
already installed on your motherboard

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.369 
already installed on your motherboard
and<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.819> one<00:03:27.000> sits<00:03:27.269> at<00:03:27.569> clipped<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:28.080> there

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
and that one sits at clipped on there

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.649 
and that one sits at clipped on there
then<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.010> next<00:03:29.220> thing<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.549> do<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.209> screw<00:03:30.510> in

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
then the next thing to do is to screw in

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.140 
then the next thing to do is to screw in
these<00:03:31.200> two<00:03:31.560> screws<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.159> go<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.430> either<00:03:32.670> side

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
these two screws that go on either side

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.770 
these two screws that go on either side
okay<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:33.989> they<00:03:34.290> give<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:36.540> know<00:03:36.569> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
okay so they give you you know the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.390 
okay so they give you you know the
chance<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.290> put<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.099> hopefully

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
chance to put that in and then hopefully

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.940 
chance to put that in and then hopefully
you've<00:03:38.519> got<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> screw<00:03:38.940> driver<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.269> can<00:03:39.450> just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
you've got a screw driver you can just

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.619 
you've got a screw driver you can just
put<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.129> two<00:03:41.310> screws<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.849> on<00:03:41.879> one<00:03:42.120> side<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
put the two screws one on one side and

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.600 
put the two screws one on one side and
the<00:03:42.900> other<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:43.349> here<00:03:43.590> at<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> top<00:03:43.980> okay

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the other one up here at the top okay

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.240 
the other one up here at the top okay
you<00:03:44.670> screw<00:03:45.030> those<00:03:45.209> two<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:47.040> it's

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
you screw those two in and and now it's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.210 
you screw those two in and and now it's
fastened<00:03:47.790> nicely<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.750> there<00:03:48.900> clip<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> fan

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
fastened nicely in there clip the fan

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.880 
fastened nicely in there clip the fan
back<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.760> there<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.439> you're<00:03:52.650> set

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
back in there and and then you're set

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.360 
back in there and and then you're set
now<00:03:53.400> like<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.730> said<00:03:54.140> I'm<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.200> very<00:03:55.379> happy<00:03:56.069> at

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
now like I said I'm not very happy at

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.520 
now like I said I'm not very happy at
the<00:03:56.519> way<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.879> fan<00:03:57.090> clips<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.659> there<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.110> find<00:03:58.439> it

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the way the fan clips in there I find it

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.580 
the way the fan clips in there I find it
kind<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.860> flimsy<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.700> either<00:04:00.330> way<00:04:00.810> with<00:04:01.409> this

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
kind of flimsy but either way with this

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.890 
kind of flimsy but either way with this
test<00:04:01.890> system<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.400> was<00:04:02.580> very<00:04:02.909> very<00:04:03.120> surprised<00:04:03.659> at

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
test system I was very very surprised at

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.839 
test system I was very very surprised at
the<00:04:03.989> results<00:04:04.560> okay<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.280> results<00:04:05.430> are

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
the results okay the results are

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.160 
the results okay the results are
excellent<00:04:06.709> on<00:04:07.709> idle<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.610> was<00:04:09.030> getting<00:04:09.269> about<00:04:09.420> 24

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
excellent on idle I was getting about 24

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.509 
excellent on idle I was getting about 24
degrees<00:04:10.680> Celsius

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
degrees Celsius

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.820 
degrees Celsius
now<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:12.030> very<00:04:12.420> very<00:04:12.629> low<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.080> then<00:04:13.620> on

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
now that's very very low and then on

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.570 
now that's very very low and then on
full<00:04:14.189> load

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
full load

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.819 
full load
41<00:04:15.180> degrees<00:04:15.390> Celsius<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.199> that's<00:04:16.380> terrific

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
41 degrees Celsius so that's terrific

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.210 
41 degrees Celsius so that's terrific
for<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.250> 6<00:04:17.489> core<00:04:17.699> processor<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:19.049> again<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.100> only

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
for a 6 core processor so again the only

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.789 
for a 6 core processor so again the only
thing<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.489> didn't<00:04:20.699> like<00:04:20.729> is

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
thing I didn't like is

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.559 
thing I didn't like is
fan<00:04:22.069> and<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.699> installation<00:04:23.180> could<00:04:23.330> have<00:04:23.449> been

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:23.569 
fan and the installation could have been

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:25.629 
fan and the installation could have been
a<00:04:23.599> little<00:04:23.870> bit<00:04:23.960> more<00:04:23.990> friendlier<00:04:24.500> but<00:04:24.740> still

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
a little bit more friendlier but still

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.309 
a little bit more friendlier but still
seven<00:04:26.060> out<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.210> ten<00:04:26.479> is<00:04:26.599> what<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> give<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.139> and

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
seven out of ten is what I give it and

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.649 
seven out of ten is what I give it and
I'd<00:04:28.009> like<00:04:28.159> to<00:04:28.220> thank<00:04:28.490> Arctic<00:04:29.210> cooling<00:04:29.509> for

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
I'd like to thank Arctic cooling for

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.119 
I'd like to thank Arctic cooling for
providing<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.289> I<00:04:30.500> hope<00:04:30.650> enjoyed<00:04:31.009> this

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
providing it and I hope enjoyed this

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.539
