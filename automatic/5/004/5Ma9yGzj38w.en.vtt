00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.290
 ah 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello everyone and ximena siles welcome 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.570
 to a new animal design tutorial 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.150
 crossing and today we are going to make the flowers 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.610
 of sakura 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.610
 the grayish tile 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.070
 we also forgot to take a low and 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.070
 we make the dot in the middle 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.490
 now we start a little inside the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.360
 with the darkest we give it below 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.650
 with I'm here we fill in the sides 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.629
 in the other side 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.629
 with this filling we give it away 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.110
 and with this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 and with this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.269
 we already have the sakura flowers now 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.459
 we will make the little ones the little ones 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.409
 they are the easiest 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.069
 we make a dark dot like that and with a 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.069
 lighter 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 okay now let's go for some dishes 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.750
 to make some petals 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.750
 we have this guy 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.300
 this guy and this guy do not forget 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.910
 make them some waves 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.700
 so that it is much more original now 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.190
 what we are going to do is the grass let's go 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.200
 to make a grass fill 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.680
 and the first thing I do is fill out the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.680
 corners 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.840
 of the eggs
