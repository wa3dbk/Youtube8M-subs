00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.490
 teach how to make an effective trap 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.589
 for mosquitoes although it is good for 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.750
 any insect we started the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 materials that we will need are a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
 plastic bottle the size that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.760
 you want a container with water to the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.680
 you will see so that the following material goes 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.740
 to be a little bit of yeast that you can 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.109
 find in any sugar bakery 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 me in this case elected dark and some 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.689
 scissors or anything to cut and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 of course a paper bag that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.510
 we started 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.989
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.940
 cut more or less the bottle that you have 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:46.059
 chosen to one third of its size we are 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.339
 cutting and when we have we take the 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.589
 part that we have left and we are going to put 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.449
 funnel mode on top of 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.129
 we remove them because you do not 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.559
 faults is the second step what we are going to 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.559
 perform is in the water mix we are going to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.640
 add the sugar and we're going to put it in 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.640
 one third of the bottle 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.130
 we add the sugar little by little in the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.119
 Water 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.119
 one 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.940
 let's see the second 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.230
 we mix so that the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.490
 mix and we add the second now what 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.440
 what we have to do is let rest 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 a little bit stirring little by little 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 slowly so that it is homogeneous as 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 we have already said 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.990
 Once this is done, you have represented 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.990
 either 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.820
 is to add it to the bottle 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.630
 little by little not to stain anything 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.189
 we add the mixture in the pot 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.520
 remove the container that we have 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.520
 serve on your site 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.600
 the plug we will not use it with which 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 we remove it 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.260
 Now what we have to do is add 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.130
 the yeast that is the ingredient 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 main let's say whose function is going to be 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.580
 let say 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.650
 synthesize co2 help how they are 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 coming out the little bubbles I do not know if it 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.930
 appreciate we will accept it a little more 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.900
 the air drawings as they come out good 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.130
 this is what mosquitoes detect and 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.290
 what is going to bring them to the trap 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.660
 Now what we have to do is put 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.530
 a little bit of zeal in this case because 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.920
 it would strain 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.010
 the funnel and we're going to put it on top of the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.720
 everything so that none go only 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.170
 we take two parts of heat and we put it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.110
 up and stick it in a body of water 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.520
 there it is perfect we stick it for 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.420
 that does not escape from below 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.180
 and now we only have to wrap 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.710
 the piece of bag I have chosen a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.170
 bag but you can choose any other 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.840
 material that is plastic to wrap 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.910
 the perimeter of the bottle 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.980
 in this case he got it white because it's 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 the one that best reflects sunlight 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.080
 and good 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.620
 but let's look at the perimeter of the bottle 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.790
 and that's where we let him be tense and 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.300
 finally we put a little zeal 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.820
 to hold it this trap is pretty 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.200
 effective since the co2 that synthesizes the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.170
 yeast 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.510
 lasts a few days and is effective 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.970
 from two or three hours so nothing 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.739
 I hope you make many mosquitoes that 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.950
 you liked it and you comment what you 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.440
 it seems a greeting and if you liked the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.739
 video subscribe if you're not already give it 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.870
 a like share and comment 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.110
 Greetings mates until the week that 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.110
 comes
