just<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> explain<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> little<00:00:14.519> bit<00:00:14.730> more

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
just want to explain a little bit more

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
just want to explain a little bit more
about<00:00:15.269> ridges<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.260> I've<00:00:16.560> been<00:00:16.740> talking<00:00:16.949> about

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
about ridges and I've been talking about

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.920 
about ridges and I've been talking about
ridges<00:00:17.369> over<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> last<00:00:17.730> few<00:00:17.970> days<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.539> we've

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
ridges over the last few days and we've

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.029 
ridges over the last few days and we've
got<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> Atlantic<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
got them out in the Atlantic it's a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
got them out in the Atlantic it's a
feature<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.910> weather<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.689> winter<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
feature of the weather this winter and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.900 
feature of the weather this winter and
there's<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> chart<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.369> look<00:00:23.730> it's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
there's one on the chart here look it's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.040 
there's one on the chart here look it's
that<00:00:24.000> feature<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:25.109> through<00:00:26.060> there<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.539> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that feature going through there so this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040 
that feature going through there so this
is<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.949> breach<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is the breach in here now what that is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
is the breach in here now what that is
is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.009> flow<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.579> 500<00:00:33.239> millibars

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is the flow at 500 millibars

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
is the flow at 500 millibars
so<00:00:33.899> imagine<00:00:34.620> we've<00:00:34.739> got<00:00:34.890> air<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
so imagine we've got air that's just

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
so imagine we've got air that's just
been<00:00:35.700> pumped<00:00:36.030> northwards<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.630> warm<00:00:37.020> air<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
been pumped northwards here warm air it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.729 
been pumped northwards here warm air it
then<00:00:37.530> sinks<00:00:37.860> AdWords<00:00:38.340> log<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
then sinks AdWords log through into the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
then sinks AdWords log through into the
into<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.730> case<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> northeastern

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
into on this case to the northeastern

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330 
into on this case to the northeastern
parts<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> Canaries<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.100> across

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
parts of the Canaries and then across

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
parts of the Canaries and then across
the<00:00:44.640> northern<00:00:45.390> parts<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> Africa<00:00:46.590> basically

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the northern parts of Africa basically

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
the northern parts of Africa basically
that's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.760> jet<00:00:48.000> stream<00:00:48.210> through<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.629> now

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's a jet stream through there now

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.590 
that's a jet stream through there now
but<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> called<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.280> amiga<00:00:50.940> high<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
but this is called an amiga high that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.500 
but this is called an amiga high that
shape<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.530> basically<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
shape there is basically the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
shape there is basically the
mathematical<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.469> Greek<00:00:55.770> mathematical

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
mathematical the Greek mathematical

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.779 
mathematical the Greek mathematical
symbol<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.680> Amelia<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> region

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
symbol for Amelia but it's this region

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
symbol for Amelia but it's this region
here<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> explain<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.410> bit

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
here that I want to explain a little bit

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
here that I want to explain a little bit
about<00:01:01.739> what's<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:02.640> ridges<00:01:03.629> are

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
about what's going on because ridges are

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
about what's going on because ridges are
topper<00:01:04.019> levels<00:01:04.379> obviously<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:05.369> tied<00:01:05.700> with

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
topper levels obviously are tied with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
topper levels obviously are tied with
high<00:01:06.720> pressure<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.320> low<00:01:07.530> levels<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:07.920> not

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
high pressure at low levels or not

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010 
high pressure at low levels or not
obviously<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.869> they

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
obviously really but that's what they

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
obviously really but that's what they
are<00:01:10.049> tied<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.220> Ridge<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.640> higher<00:01:11.850> levels

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
are tied with so Ridge at higher levels

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.350 
are tied with so Ridge at higher levels
is<00:01:12.770> similar<00:01:13.770> ish<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> ridge<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> levels<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
is similar ish to a ridge it levels in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.399 
is similar ish to a ridge it levels in
that<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.229> high

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that it's something to do with high

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
that it's something to do with high
pressure<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> explain<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
pressure but I just want to explain a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.340 
pressure but I just want to explain a
little<00:01:18.119> bit<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.900> we're<00:01:19.049> looking

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little bit more about what we're looking

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890 
little bit more about what we're looking
at<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> chart<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.900> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
at when we look at a chart like this you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
at when we look at a chart like this you
see<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> center<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> ridge<00:01:23.220> in

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
see we got the center of the ridge in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.030 
see we got the center of the ridge in
there<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.560> even<00:01:25.860> across

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
there and just down here or even across

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
there and just down here or even across
here<00:01:26.460> let's<00:01:26.729> say<00:01:26.939> we've<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.140> blue<00:01:28.439> color

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
here let's say we've got this blue color

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
here let's say we've got this blue color
and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> blue<00:01:29.100> color<00:01:29.250> indicates<00:01:29.790> low<00:01:30.420> height

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and the blue color indicates low height

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
and the blue color indicates low height
so<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> opposite<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so this is the opposite here so here we

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
so this is the opposite here so here we
have<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> center<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> high<00:01:33.659> heights<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.259> we've

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
have a center of high heights here we've

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
have a center of high heights here we've
got<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> center<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.070> low<00:01:35.700> Heights<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.390> what's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
got a center of low Heights and what's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
got a center of low Heights and what's
happening<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.500> air<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.890> pumping

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
happening here is that air is pumping

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.539 
happening here is that air is pumping
north<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.970> building<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.049> ridge<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.770> here

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
north it's building this ridge in here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
north it's building this ridge in here
air<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.060> pumping<00:01:42.540> south<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
air is pumping south and because it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
air is pumping south and because it's
cold<00:01:43.649> air<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.009> cold<00:01:44.460> air<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:44.970> dense<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
cold air that cold air is more dense so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.850 
cold air that cold air is more dense so
what<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> does<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> lowers<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> height

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
what it does it lowers the height

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.149 
what it does it lowers the height
whereas<00:01:47.729> add<00:01:48.030> towards<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> red<00:01:48.990> west<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
whereas add towards the red west in this

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
whereas add towards the red west in this
feature<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.270> ridge<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.930> increase

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
feature here in this ridge we increase

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
feature here in this ridge we increase
height<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.549> lower<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> heights<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
height here we lower the heights of the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
height here we lower the heights of the
500<00:01:55.049> millibar<00:01:55.350> surface<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.729> were<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
500 millibar surface so if we were to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
500 millibar surface so if we were to
draw<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> line<00:01:57.479> between<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:58.170> let's<00:01:58.439> say<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
draw a line between here let's say and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
draw a line between here let's say and
here<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.759> between<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> high<00:02:00.329> center<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
here so between the high center and the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
here so between the high center and the
low<00:02:01.140> Center<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.920> would<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.189> something<00:02:02.460> like

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
low Center it would look something like

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
low Center it would look something like
this<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.450> let's<00:02:03.960> say<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.350> we've<00:02:04.439> got<00:02:04.469> two

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this so let's say that we've got two

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
this so let's say that we've got two
height<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.450> side<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> graph

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
height going up that side of the graph

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.419 
height going up that side of the graph
there<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.710> that's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
there so that's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
there so that's
Heights<00:02:08.609> in<00:02:08.849> there<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.929> we've<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
Heights in there and there we've got the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
Heights in there and there we've got the
distance<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.549> there<00:02:11.730> we've<00:02:11.939> got<00:02:11.969> let's<00:02:12.359> say

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
distance so in there we've got let's say

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.020 
distance so in there we've got let's say
that's<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.959> point<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.409> that's<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.819> and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
that's a point a that's in there and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.259 
that's a point a that's in there and
they're<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.409> here<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.040> point<00:02:17.519> B<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.120> we've

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
they're just in here is point B so we've

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.649 
they're just in here is point B so we've
got<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.569> there<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.200> we've<00:02:19.829> got<00:02:19.859> point<00:02:20.459> B<00:02:20.969> there

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
got a there and we've got point B there

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.899 
got a there and we've got point B there
if<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.290> were<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.500> look<00:02:22.769> at<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> 500<00:02:23.579> millibar

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
if you were to look at the 500 millibar

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.660 
if you were to look at the 500 millibar
surface<00:02:24.359> you'd<00:02:24.750> actually<00:02:24.959> see<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.560> sloping<00:02:26.459> so

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
surface you'd actually see it sloping so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.929 
surface you'd actually see it sloping so
it's<00:02:26.849> sloped<00:02:27.090> from<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> high<00:02:27.780> down<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
it's sloped from the high down to the

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.729 
it's sloped from the high down to the
low<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.510> would<00:02:30.989> give<00:02:31.139> us<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.319> difference

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
low and that would give us a difference

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.949 
low and that would give us a difference
in<00:02:31.889> height<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:32.879> example<00:02:33.269> here<00:02:33.689> we've

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
in height so for example here we've

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.050 
in height so for example here we've
perhaps<00:02:34.349> got<00:02:34.590> term<00:02:34.980> heights<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.790> don't<00:02:36.000> know

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
perhaps got term heights I don't know

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
perhaps got term heights I don't know
it's<00:02:36.239> because<00:02:36.810> they're<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.019> marked<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:37.409> there

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it's because they're not marked on there

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.229 
it's because they're not marked on there
but<00:02:37.680> let's<00:02:37.829> say<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.400> heights<00:02:38.639> in<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:38.969> zone

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
but let's say the heights in that zone

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.860 
but let's say the heights in that zone
there<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.689> perhaps<00:02:39.959> five<00:02:40.379> four<00:02:40.799> six

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
there are perhaps five four six

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.319 
there are perhaps five four six
decameters<00:02:42.870> which<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.400> 5460<00:02:44.400> meters<00:02:44.730> they're

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
decameters which is 5460 meters they're

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.929 
decameters which is 5460 meters they're
within<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.930> zone<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.590> match<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.159> five

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
within that zone they match to be five

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.170 
within that zone they match to be five
to<00:02:48.689> eight<00:02:49.590> zero<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:52.069> 5,280<00:02:53.069> meters<00:02:53.669> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
to eight zero so 5,280 meters so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.270 
to eight zero so 5,280 meters so
basically<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.750> we've<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.049> here<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.560> warm

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
basically what we've got here is warm

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.670 
basically what we've got here is warm
and<00:02:56.579> less<00:02:57.299> dense<00:02:57.569> air<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.139> in<00:02:58.260> other<00:02:58.349> words<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and less dense air so in other words it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.020 
and less dense air so in other words it
occupies<00:02:59.510> more<00:03:00.510> space<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:02.219> we've<00:03:02.819> got

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
occupies more space and here we've got

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.929 
occupies more space and here we've got
cold<00:03:03.510> denser<00:03:04.290> air<00:03:04.500> which<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:05.069> more<00:03:05.549> compressed

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
cold denser air which is more compressed

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.959 
cold denser air which is more compressed
and<00:03:06.180> occupies<00:03:07.079> less<00:03:07.109> space<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.459> why<00:03:08.760> we

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
and occupies less space so that's why we

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.869 
and occupies less space so that's why we
get<00:03:09.150> these<00:03:09.689> high<00:03:10.319> ridges<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.219> we<00:03:11.579> get<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
get these high ridges here we get the

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.129 
get these high ridges here we get the
low<00:03:12.060> bridges<00:03:12.299> there<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.810> what<00:03:13.019> we're

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
low bridges there that's what we're

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.770 
low bridges there that's what we're
referring<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.709> when<00:03:14.159> we're<00:03:14.310> referring<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
referring to when we're referring to to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.099 
referring to when we're referring to to
the<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.049> idea<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.949> a<00:03:17.010> ridge<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.819> also<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> high

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
the the idea of a ridge and also a high

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.740 
the the idea of a ridge and also a high
height<00:03:19.709> Center<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.849> low<00:03:21.030> height<00:03:21.359> Center

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
height Center and a low height Center

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
height Center and a low height Center
that's<00:03:22.079> what<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.440> would<00:03:22.530> look<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.739> across

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's what it would look like across

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.159 
that's what it would look like across
the<00:03:23.400> atmosphere<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.510> why<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:24.959> also

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
the atmosphere and that's why we also

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.979 
the atmosphere and that's why we also
say<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.829> with<00:03:26.579> ridges<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.419> with<00:03:27.540> areas<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
say that with ridges and with areas of

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.679 
say that with ridges and with areas of
high<00:03:28.590> heights<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.760> per<00:03:29.939> levels<00:03:30.299> that's

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
high heights of per levels that's

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.990 
high heights of per levels that's
associated<00:03:31.049> with<00:03:31.409> warmer<00:03:32.250> air<00:03:32.400> through<00:03:32.909> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
associated with warmer air through the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.309 
associated with warmer air through the
atmosphere<00:03:33.359> not<00:03:33.540> necessarily<00:03:34.019> warm<00:03:34.199> out

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
atmosphere not necessarily warm out

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.559 
atmosphere not necessarily warm out
surface<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:35.099> warmer<00:03:35.430> out<00:03:35.579> through<00:03:36.479> the

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
surface but warmer out through the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.599 
surface but warmer out through the
atmosphere<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.139> why<00:03:37.500> we<00:03:37.949> say<00:03:38.129> that<00:03:38.159> low

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
atmosphere and why we say that low

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.399 
atmosphere and why we say that low
Heights<00:03:38.939> are<00:03:39.209> associated<00:03:39.750> with<00:03:39.840> cold

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
Heights are associated with cold

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.710 
Heights are associated with cold
atmospheres<00:03:41.009> so<00:03:41.189> not<00:03:41.849> cold<00:03:42.090> necessarily<00:03:42.659> at

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
atmospheres so not cold necessarily at

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.929 
atmospheres so not cold necessarily at
the<00:03:42.780> surface<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:43.530> colder<00:03:43.979> atmospheres<00:03:44.459> above

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
the surface but colder atmospheres above

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.089 
the surface but colder atmospheres above
it's<00:03:45.419> great<00:03:45.629> isn't<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.500> amazing<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
it's great isn't it it's amazing the

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.039 
it's great isn't it it's amazing the
weather<00:03:47.250> actually<00:03:47.879> works<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.629> just<00:03:48.870> wanted

weather actually works so I just wanted

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.330 
weather actually works so I just wanted
