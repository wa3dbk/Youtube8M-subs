00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.440
 new video as the developer studio 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.920
 double fine in february 2012 each 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 kickstarter campaign for one of fans 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.070
 funded point and click adventure 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 no one could guess online 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.680
 that her 400,000 us dollars strong 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 reach goal in just eight hours 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.810
 but as the campaign thanks 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 almost 90,000 becker at the end with even 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.130
 several million dollars completed 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.219
 it was clear this game was just the one 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 beginning of a completely new 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.360
 financing concept for developers with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.610
 brocade came the finished game of the mother 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 all kickstarter indie game projects 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 at the beginning of the year now on desktop 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 platform and recently joined 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 there is also an ipad version to ob 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.950
 the game now but now that's good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.950
 after the intro, you will experience a lot of fun 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 I want to start with the story because 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 which is quite interesting 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 been 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.400
 instead of a linear event ask who 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 from a main character song is there 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 at broken age, both of them equal two 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.460
 between her at any time back and forth 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 You can change on one side 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
 we have weller 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 She lives in a small bakery place 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.390
 and becomes an allegedly great honor 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.009
 granted 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 because there is such a huge one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.790
 monster and therefore not the city of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 the monster will be destroyed 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.799
 regularly the most beautiful and smart 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.650
 Girl sacrificed at a big feast 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.780
 while the inhabitants of the place included 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.090
 of all the chosen girls this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 think of tradition as incredibly great 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 if he prefers the monster but would 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.479
 fight and because they are on support 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.009
 can not count from the outside takes the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.009
 that also directly in the hand 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.480
 on the other side we have fast 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.940
 a boy alone with his 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.580
 Computer parents on a spaceship in the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.920
 experienced world he actually has everything 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.380
 He first needs a nice drink 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.930
 room but he feels very lonely 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.840
 And these missions are the computer 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.420
 to simulate entertainment like him too 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.550
 so slow on the bag but as 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 he one day one of this mission 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680
 intentionally failing to be discovered 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.370
 a strange wolfs shape invites him 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.170
 on a real adventure and tells 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 him that I'm all in a big one 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.690
 war and it would be his task 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.790
 to save the innocent victims 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.280
 Of course, you can not say twice 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.410
 and so he starts hiding from his 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.630
 computer parents the words of the wolf 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.220
 well, one of them now looks good 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 or others think what should I do 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.599
 now please with two separate stories 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.760
 in a game but the special one 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 Broken just that the two 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.880
 stories though different 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.590
 could hardly be 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.060
 always something to do with each other 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.840
 I want to be here now, of course 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 do not spoil 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.980
 but the way these worlds are 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.650
 has me connected 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.780
 already downright inspired by the style 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.880
 is brocade but a complete one 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.860
 classic point click adventure through 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.569
 and by my tip where to go 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.329
 Run wants to type people around with them 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.639
 to speak introduces conversation itself 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.959
 has an inventory of its content with you 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.819
 use the game world or 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.230
 can combine with each other and so on 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.420
 on and on 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.220
 These types of games are for tablets 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.829
 and pcs, of course, just perfect and 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.350
 also the field here positively on the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.299
 Control works just terrific 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.100
 Besides, one has, of course, also here 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.380
 the whole other aspects of the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.660
 genres with them like the riddles 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.150
 in one place in the game can to 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.460
 Do not run away from the example because the computer 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.970
 constantly notices that his bed somehow 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.260
 empty is if you but a found 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.660
 supposed inflatable boat with one 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.490
 combined air pressure bottle receives 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.680
 her a rubber doll if you then 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.360
 also lies in bed in chase 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.639
 the computer kidding and her 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.919
 can just disappear naturally 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.020
 It's not that hard to find out 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.139
 but in the game it does it over and over 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.610
 change again behind 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:01.620
 computer systems a huge one 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.020
 Attention was paid to broken aids though 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.090
 also put on the graphic because all 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.580
 Elements of the game were made by hand and 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.740
 now the special does not come 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.629
 drawn but painted the whole 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.539
 game 1 you have the feeling as 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.949
 you find yourself in a moving 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.860
 oil painting and that supports the 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.180
 The effect of the fantasy world is simply enormous 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.550
 It also looks easy, of course 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.349
 damn awesome off and on 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.300
 the case that one finds the sony stupid 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.129
 You will surely like this at this 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.710
 so strongly represented the artistic 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.310
 aspect just on the retina display from 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.650
 ipad 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.810
 By the way, the soundtrack is absolutely absolute 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.180
 a whole orchestra has been successful for 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.569
 the game dragged into a recording studio and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.069
 you just notice that beautiful melodies 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.520
 everything is included 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.529
 but the characters yes this still 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.110
 not just a class of its own sense 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.779
 person into the game all totally loving 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.099
 designed and witty 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.110
 personalities 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.539
 No, the English setting is no 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.219
 just absolutely brilliant double 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.110
 that's not a pity 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.789
 a true star for the project 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.129
 occupation 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.159
 next to jack black jennifer hero and wants 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.740
 offer is even good at the start 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.659
 You do not have to write a German notepad 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.550
 but refrain thanks to accordingly 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:35.009
 translate subtitles should then 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:37.199
 everyone in the story come up with it like that 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.020
 Often when an app reviews you notice too 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.250
 Here I am impressed by the game 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.319
 Nevertheless, there are a few 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.139
 Criticisms, for example, is the game 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.060
 then quite short you get so on 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.099
 his four to five hours playing time 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.860
 but in the end with such an extreme 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.319
 cliffhanger for the already announced 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.710
 to be left standing in the second act 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.940
 that already hurts the game became 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.030
 though for ios and android 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.790
 but not so far is mobile only on the 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.250
 ipad available all without apple tablet 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.230
 therefore have to go to a mac pc or 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.450
 linux-calculator 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.670
 but let's see how fast that will be 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.830
 I can change everything in one game 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.840
 but still on every platform only 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.000
 recommend some like the price 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.820
 maybe for something I hold but 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.680
 hey quality it's not free and 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.110
 I think the fun is the coal 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.370
 in any case in this sense thank you 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.380
 I am still very cordial 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.300
 for you to see for wish you still 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.130
 have fun with brocade and say now 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.130
 See you next time
