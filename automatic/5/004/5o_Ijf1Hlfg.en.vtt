00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.910
 when they ask us to interpolate terms 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.610
 they will always give us two numbers 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 any and we will have to find 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.990
 a series of numbers that are 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.730
 included between these two and that 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.710
 form an arithmetic progression 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.010
 so let's make an example that is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:31.369
 this one here where they give us one 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:35.270
 which is minus 20 and to 6 which is 5 and we 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.350
 they ask that we interpol four 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.899
 terms that's why it goes from 1 to 6 because in 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.840
 medium have to go 4 terms to 2 to 3 to 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.830
 4 and 5 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.330
 between these two figures thus to 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.880
 the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:57.190
 calculate the distance this will have 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.860
 arithmetic progression for it we 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.110
 we will fix well on the formula that was 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.730
 is here 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.830
 we will use the one below or we can 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.770
 use the first one because they give us one 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.210
 that will be minus twenty and six that will be 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.450
 five and with this formula we will calculate the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.720
 distance for it we'll put it here at 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.720
 side 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.799
 What we will do 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.799
 n is to 6 therefore it will be 5 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.860
 is equal to 1 that are minus 20 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.620
 plus 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.350
 parenthesis n which is the subscript of this 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.710
 term from here which is the sixth term 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.480
 therefore 6 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.300
 - one 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.040
 because we are using 1 subscript 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.040
 1 per d 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.789
 and I repeat again in this way 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.489
 we will calculate the distance that there will be 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.619
 between the terms and then if we know 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.140
 that distance is a specific number 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.150
 we will add by subtracting each one and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 we will know the terms that go in between 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.739
 first we make the parenthesis so 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.690
 that this stays the same 5 is equal to 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:31.480
 minus 20 plus 6 -1 are 5 d 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.550
 to isolate it from this 20 we pass it to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:45.180
 Another positive side so that 5 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:45.180
 + 20 equals 5 of 5 20 are 25 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.819
 and to isolate it from this 5 pass 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.819
 dividing 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.849
 and 25 match 5 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.849
 is equal to 5 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 so that this arithmetic progression 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.750
 that goes from minus 20 to 5 and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.000
 you have to have four terms 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.500
 between these two figures will have a 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.670
 difference of 5 is to say if I the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:27.960
 first number was at least 20 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:30.960
 to know the second I add 5 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960
 5 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.580
 so that minus 20 5 are minus 15 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 I add another 5 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.350
 and -15 5 are 10 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.350
 I add another 5 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.310
 and minus 10 5 are minus five we are 5 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.990
 - 550 and yes added five 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:16.810
 05 are 5 and see what we have left 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.140
 and at 4 numbers this minus 20 was the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.140
 one 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.170
 this will be the a 2 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.300
 to 3 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:32.740
 to 4 to 5 and the 5 that is what they gave us 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.740
 It was 6 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.590
 and in this is to interpolate in 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.050
 look for these values ​​that go between two 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.569
 any numbers so that it 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.569
 meets an arithmetic progression
