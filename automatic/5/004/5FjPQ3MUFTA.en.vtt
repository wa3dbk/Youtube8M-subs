September<00:00:20.760> 8th<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.539> coming<00:00:21.960> into<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.289> pretty

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
September 8th we're coming into a pretty

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.250 
September 8th we're coming into a pretty
intense<00:00:22.980> square<00:00:23.400> between<00:00:23.730> Mars<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.869> planet

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
intense square between Mars the planet

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.710 
intense square between Mars the planet
of<00:00:25.350> hot<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.830> Saturn<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> planet<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.119> cold<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
of hot and Saturn the planet of cold and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.439 
of hot and Saturn the planet of cold and
it's<00:00:28.500> late<00:00:28.949> tonight<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.310> early<00:00:29.580> tomorrow<00:00:29.760> and

it's late tonight or early tomorrow and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's late tonight or early tomorrow and
I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.439> sets<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> tone<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
I think that sets the tone for like you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720 
I think that sets the tone for like you
said<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> very<00:00:33.960> strange<00:00:34.350> day<00:00:34.680> well<00:00:35.399> usually

to<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.960> held<00:00:49.350> accountable<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.340> yet<00:00:50.969> there's

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to be held accountable and yet there's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.619 
to be held accountable and yet there's
some<00:00:51.449> weird<00:00:51.750> aspects<00:00:52.620> today<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
some weird aspects today that make it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
some weird aspects today that make it
difficult<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.440> feel<00:00:55.649> accountable<00:00:56.010> because

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
difficult to feel accountable because

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
difficult to feel accountable because
the<00:00:56.850> world<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.840> strange<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the world is just a strange and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
the world is just a strange and
unfamiliar<00:00:58.859> place<00:00:59.219> yeah<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.030> almost

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
unfamiliar place yeah it's it's almost

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
unfamiliar place yeah it's it's almost
like<00:01:00.840> there's<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.500> chess<00:01:01.980> game<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.030> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
like there's this chess game going on in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200 
like there's this chess game going on in
some<00:01:03.539> parallel<00:01:03.780> universe<00:01:04.760> we're<00:01:05.760> looking

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
some parallel universe we're looking

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
some parallel universe we're looking
here<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.600> our<00:01:06.840> world<00:01:07.260> following<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.430> rules

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
here in our world following the rules

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
here in our world following the rules
making<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> move<00:01:09.570> according<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> rules

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
making the move according to the rules

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.880 
making the move according to the rules
and<00:01:10.799> something<00:01:11.549> happens<00:01:12.000> totally<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.590> seems

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and something happens totally it seems

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.289 
and something happens totally it seems
like<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.340> nothing<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.060> anything

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like it has nothing to do with anything

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.230 
like it has nothing to do with anything
but<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.990> takes<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> entire<00:01:16.950> day<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> pulls<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
but it takes the entire day and pulls it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300 
but it takes the entire day and pulls it
in<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.479> direction<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> Bob<00:01:19.890> Dylan's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
in that direction I think of Bob Dylan's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
in that direction I think of Bob Dylan's
song<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> simple<00:01:22.200> twist<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.650> fate

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
song you know a simple twist of fate

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.039 
song you know a simple twist of fate
today<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> day<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.900> many

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
today is a day where there are so many

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.520 
today is a day where there are so many
sept-iles<00:01:26.040> based<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.689> seventh<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
sept-iles based on on a one seventh of a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
sept-iles based on on a one seventh of a
circle<00:01:28.920> aspect<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.750> many

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
circle aspect that there are so many

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.859 
circle aspect that there are so many
sept-iles<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> almost<00:01:32.400> assures<00:01:33.270> us<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
sept-iles that it almost assures us that

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.140 
sept-iles that it almost assures us that
things<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> happen<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.700> are

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
things are going to happen that are

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.289 
things are going to happen that are
fated<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.590> Mary<00:01:37.770> Poppins<00:01:38.100> wind<00:01:38.610> blowing

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fated it's the Mary Poppins wind blowing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
fated it's the Mary Poppins wind blowing
in<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.990> things<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.680> weird<00:01:41.040> things<00:01:41.820> are

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
in and things get weird things are

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.389 
in and things get weird things are
strange<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.500> why<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.189> are

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
strange and we don't know why they are

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
strange and we don't know why they are
and<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.530> can't

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and I think what that means is we can't

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.310 
and I think what that means is we can't
be<00:01:47.310> committed<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> controlling<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> outcome

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
be committed to controlling the outcome

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
be committed to controlling the outcome
right<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.670> control<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> around

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
right all that we can control is around

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.859 
right all that we can control is around
behavior<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> our<00:01:52.590> own<00:01:52.829> responses<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.939> being

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
behavior and our own responses and being

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200 
behavior and our own responses and being
responsible<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:56.280> about<00:01:56.579> having<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> capacity

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
responsible is about having the capacity

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.870 
responsible is about having the capacity
to<00:01:57.750> respond<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.040> may<00:01:59.159> even<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.759> do

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to respond and that may even have to do

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
to respond and that may even have to do
with<00:02:00.030> responding<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.899> weird<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.320> unexpected

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
with responding to weird and unexpected

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.969 
with responding to weird and unexpected
conditions<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:03.390> Jeff<00:02:03.750> shower<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.740> murk
