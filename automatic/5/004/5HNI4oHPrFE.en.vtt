00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 Ladies and gentlemen, I have been back in Berlin for some time now 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.030
 Hamburg take pictures here in the harbor 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.019
 today with two fixed widths of 85 and 35 millimeters 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.819
 Focal length and given occasion, it is in this video once around the term 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.969
 the focal length go up to this focal length at all photographically 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:26.539
 seen and how closely the focal length combined with the photographic perspective 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.720
 if we simplify a photographic objective as one concern 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.540
 imagine 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.660
 then the focal length is the distance from that lens to the focal point than to the focal length 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 Point where all parallel to the optical axis einfanden 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.690
 Bundle light rays behind the lens 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.060
 the focal length is therefore a measure of the refractive power of this photographic 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.690
 Appetite is 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.829
 at a long focal length, the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 Rays of light little broken that is, it takes longer to the rear of this 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.510
 Focus coincide 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 if you have a short focal length with this focal point forward because of that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 objectively or collect them 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 deflects the light rays more strongly 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 what does all this mean to us photographically 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.290
 at a lens with a short focal length 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.160
 Even the rays of light that are very decentralized so with a very 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.860
 very large angle on this lens still meet in the sensor plane 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.110
 be imaged 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.460
 that is, we have a very very objective lens with a short focal length 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 large picture angles so these are soon Winkler Welti wants the other way around 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.290
 a longer focal length, the light rays are less distracted 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 that is, only those fall 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.369
 the duty radiate at a very very small angle from the optical 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.479
 Axis into the optical system actually fall on the sensor 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.960
 that's eight focal lengths which are a very very narrow angle of view for themselves 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.100
 weigh 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.520
 The angle of view we are always talking about here is not just 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.369
 depending on the focal length but it also depends on the recording medium 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.500
 or the recording format 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.710
 a 50 millimeter lens Bailly for example on the small image sensor 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.499
 a picture angle Tyrol times from the approximately 45 degrees 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.560
 if you reduce the size of the sensor, logically also the size decreases 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.479
 Picture Dirk and all of the sensor and thus logically also the angle of view 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.270
 is this apparent focal length laying new German always with 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 Header goal called 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.639
 from the so related to the 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.730
 smaller digital cameras subject the speech is not the focal length remembers 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.659
 in the whole thing only the angle of view becomes Engert so to speak that that 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.089
 Recording format is simply a smaller one 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.760
 and now they go the angle of view respectively the focal length with the 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.799
 photographic perspective together 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.680
 and they do not actually do that to illustrate the whole thing in practice 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.069
 I took my picture of an old Mercedes 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.839
 Take 85 millimeters focal length as a relatively small angle 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.200
 and that a recording distance of about five to six meters and here could 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.880
 This recording already rudimentary to see what you are like the typical Teela 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.820
 objectively call perspective 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.450
 that means he has a very very compressed picture impression of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.129
 Foreground and background 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.040
 10 very very bad I pushed together or relatively flat 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.099
 pushed together 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.499
 and you see relatively little of the foreground relative to the foreground 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.260
 background 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.650
 the second picture I made from the same point of view the SVA with one 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.629
 in math of 35 millimeters and due to the lower focal length and 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.630
 Bild Winkels see here logically way left and right next to the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.790
 Car much more of the environment but the perspective itself is the same 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.189
 remained 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.859
 You can easily see this when looking at the 35 millimeter lens image 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:30.290
 now 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.260
 the center is zoomed out and in the image section digital, so to speak 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.249
 increases the same image section so the same 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.599
 Waving picture looks as before with the lens of 80 mm lens 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.070
 and here you see so except for the easy 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.790
 Variations of blur in the background that perspective exactly 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.649
 the same is as before objective with that of 80 mm 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.629
 the proportions of foreground and background are exact 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.180
 the same as the 85 millimeter lens 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.510
 that means the perspective is not dependent on the focal length 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.359
 the perspective is dependent 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.749
 Shape on the object's stand to camera 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.019
 so if I use the tool to lens the 30 millimeter wide-angle lens 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.189
 Distance to the object reduce until the front and again just as big 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.229
 is pictured 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.829
 as before with 85 millimeters then I want to see that I actually do so 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.919
 with perspective change 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.500
 that's what I mean in comparison to the previous day and rather background than 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.729
 before in this distanced in position with the longer focal length 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.599
 I have a much more plastic depiction of the distance from 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.520
 Foreground so background is exaggerated you can do that at this 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.380
 see elongated trunk lid and so that's a very very good 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.900
 Example of distorted perspective distorted playback 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.059
 a largely objective is the said not only by the use of a 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.060
 lower focal length comes about but just just that I 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.120
 did not give more to the object 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.690
 depending on which perspective effect I have in mind later 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.220
 I would like to wavy more than the wide range if I for example 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.530
 Buildings photograph this building should look bigger than in the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.340
 reality 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.930
 I use a wide angle or a lower wide angle to through the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.980
 perspective distortions to highlight the size of the building as possible 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.129
 in portraits, this kind of perspective distortion would be through 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.030
 an ultra wide angle of course he would be counterproductive to the nose 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.259
 Example very very big act on these pictures and that finch me there 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.249
 rather a few steps back and workers from that dance about 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.559
 four to six meters with a light to medium Thiele focal length in the 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:27.650
 Range from 85 to 235 millimeters 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.970
 So it does not hurt to turn the ring instead of nine o'clock in the evening 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.220
 To reduce or enlarge the distance to the object 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.910
 and to see how that affects the photographic perspective 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.430
 he hopes that all will serve a perspective as far as further perspectives are concerned 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.830
 This will make it a bit more photograph their Hamburg and Tel Hesseneck
