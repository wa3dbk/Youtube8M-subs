00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
if I could find a chemist that would

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.390 
if I could find a chemist that would
listen<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.610> me<00:01:04.229> come<00:01:05.229> up<00:01:05.379> with<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.590> formula<00:01:05.920> that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400

was<00:01:06.490> completely<00:01:07.030> different<00:01:07.180> than<00:01:07.390> all<00:01:07.720> the

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
was completely different than all the

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.600 
was completely different than all the
other<00:01:08.020> nail<00:01:08.259> polish<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.979> market<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.549> it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
other nail polish on the market so it

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.969 
other nail polish on the market so it
would<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.850> long<00:01:10.180> wearing<00:01:10.689> it<00:01:11.380> would<00:01:11.619> go<00:01:11.799> on

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
would be long wearing it would go on

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.810 
would be long wearing it would go on
like<00:01:12.009> silk<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.880> would<00:01:13.150> wear<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.480> iron<00:01:14.140> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like silk it would wear like iron and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.280 
like silk it would wear like iron and
women<00:01:15.820> wouldn't<00:01:16.390> have<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.660> worry<00:01:16.840> about<00:01:16.990> what

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
women wouldn't have to worry about what

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.840 
women wouldn't have to worry about what
their<00:01:17.440> nails<00:01:17.620> look<00:01:17.830> like<00:01:17.860> because<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.730> would

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
their nails look like because it would

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.900 
their nails look like because it would
wear<00:01:19.030> great<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.750> whole<00:01:19.960> week<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.170> ten<00:01:20.530> days

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
wear great for a whole week to ten days

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.210 
wear great for a whole week to ten days
