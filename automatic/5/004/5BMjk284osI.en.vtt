00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
cooling system finished and give it a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
cooling system finished and give it a
proper<00:01:52.920> run<00:01:53.220> clear<00:01:53.549> its<00:01:53.700> throat<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.290> if<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
proper run clear its throat and if this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
proper run clear its throat and if this
touchy<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.250> governor<00:01:56.700> sorted<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.840> I'm

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
touchy little governor sorted as I'm

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840 
touchy little governor sorted as I'm
moving<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> hair's<00:01:58.979> thickness<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
moving that a hair's thickness just to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
moving that a hair's thickness just to
get<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.170> idle<00:02:02.329> that<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:03.899> promising

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
get it to idle that it's very promising

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.219 
get it to idle that it's very promising
thanks<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:04.950> watching
