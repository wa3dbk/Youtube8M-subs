that's obviously 720p i'll i'll name it
as<00:02:05.570> 114<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.469> IC

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.940 

obviously<00:02:11.690> deadly<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.170> later<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.440> I'm<00:02:12.830> not

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
obviously deadly it later on I'm not

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250 
obviously deadly it later on I'm not
going<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.190> use<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.490> there's<00:02:13.850> 29<00:02:14.180> frames<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
going to use it so there's 29 frames and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.640 
going to use it so there's 29 frames and
obviously<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> bitrate<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.820> about<00:02:17.650> 16

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
obviously you up the bitrate to about 16

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.090 
obviously you up the bitrate to about 16
or<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:20.360> can't<00:02:20.570> even<00:02:20.750> do<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.830> just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
or you can't even do that so you just

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.680 
or you can't even do that so you just
max<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.490> out<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> most

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.290 

just<00:02:35.350> see<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> most<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.070> that's<00:02:36.340> 13<00:02:37.620> okay

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
just see the most so that's 13 okay

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.540 
just see the most so that's 13 okay
135,000<00:02:40.300> hosey<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.530> won't<00:02:41.740> be<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.280> best

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
135,000 hosey it won't be like the best

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.460 
135,000 hosey it won't be like the best
but<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> will<00:02:43.300> be<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.660> alright<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.200> I'm<00:02:44.320> just

oh just take a while so yeah let it just
do<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.940> video<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.270> done<00:03:43.830> rendering

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
do that so the video is done rendering

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.390 
do that so the video is done rendering
on<00:03:45.780> when<00:03:46.780> there's<00:03:46.930> me<00:03:47.080> make<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.320> i<00:03:47.620> do<00:03:47.830> not<00:03:48.220> use

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
on when there's me make up i do not use

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.040 
on when there's me make up i do not use
Windows<00:03:48.880> Movie<00:03:49.000> Maker<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> video

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
Windows Movie Maker this is a video

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.560 
Windows Movie Maker this is a video
specially<00:03:50.770> for<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.280> suggest<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.090> how<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.300> meant

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
specially for I suggest on how you meant

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.080 
specially for I suggest on how you meant
to<00:03:52.690> render<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.110> stop<00:03:53.290> at<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.310> i<00:03:54.520> can<00:03:54.580> open<00:03:54.850> in

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
to render and stop at so i can open in

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.760 
to render and stop at so i can open in
the<00:03:55.180> folder<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:55.870> play<00:03:56.110> it<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.620> i'm<00:03:56.709> just

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
the folder can just play it so i'm just

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.830 
the folder can just play it so i'm just
going<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> hit<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.280> play<00:03:57.580> button<00:03:57.840> obviously

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
going to hit the play button obviously

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.449 
going to hit the play button obviously
it's<00:03:58.930> going<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.110> open<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.160> as<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.400> can

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
it's going to open up and so as you can

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.420 
it's going to open up and so as you can
see<00:04:00.670> here<00:04:00.910> obviously<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.900> might<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> bit

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
see here obviously it might be a bit

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.340 
see here obviously it might be a bit
laggy<00:04:03.700> because<00:04:04.120> obviously<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.600> windows<00:04:05.050> 8<00:04:05.230> is

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
laggy because obviously the windows 8 is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.130 
laggy because obviously the windows 8 is
new<00:04:06.090> when<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.150> didn't<00:04:07.390> head<00:04:07.510> up<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.780> beginning

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
new when I didn't head up the beginning

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.960 
new when I didn't head up the beginning
bit<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:09.760> will<00:04:09.850> be<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:10.000> bit<00:04:10.209> weird<00:04:11.970> so

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
bit so it will be a bit weird so

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.960 
bit so it will be a bit weird so
obviously<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.239> see<00:04:13.600> if<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:14.019> like<00:04:14.650> rendu<00:04:15.640> videos

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
then obviously we'll come up with all

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.860 
then obviously we'll come up with all
the<00:05:17.130> kbps<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:18.000> have<00:05:18.270> your<00:05:18.480> frame<00:05:18.840> rate

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
the kbps and you have your frame rate

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.510 
the kbps and you have your frame rate
which<00:05:19.290> is<00:05:19.320> right<00:05:19.650> there<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.010> hit<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.280> frame

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
which is right there and hit the frame

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.150 
which is right there and hit the frame
rate<00:05:20.730> thing<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.810> says<00:05:22.020> how<00:05:22.590> much<00:05:22.800> frames

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
rate thing and it says how much frames

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.240 
rate thing and it says how much frames
your<00:05:23.490> video<00:05:24.000> recording<00:05:24.540> at<00:05:24.660> minus<00:05:24.980> 59.94<00:05:25.980> so

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
your video recording at minus 59.94 so

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.400 
your video recording at minus 59.94 so
you<00:05:26.340> might<00:05:26.550> not<00:05:26.670> see<00:05:26.730> like<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:28.110> end<00:05:28.320> bit<00:05:28.650> but

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
you might not see like the end bit but

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.910 
you might not see like the end bit but
it<00:05:31.410> depends<00:05:31.830> if<00:05:31.980> it's<00:05:33.110> 29.99<00:05:34.110> frames<00:05:34.530> if<00:05:34.680> its

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
it depends if it's 29.99 frames if its

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.160 
it depends if it's 29.99 frames if its
twenty<00:05:35.010> nine<00:05:35.250> frames<00:05:35.400> it's<00:05:35.760> actually<00:05:36.180> 29.97

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
twenty nine frames it's actually 29.97
