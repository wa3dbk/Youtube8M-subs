00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.470
 ah 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.650
 You have decided like the rest of your 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.110
 mates be in masterchef juniors 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.309
 how were the first contacts 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.309
 what is your feeling 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.690
 I am delighted for the end it is 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.030
 similar to professional master chef of 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.760
 the older ones but it's totally different 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.590
 because we have some children that 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.720
 come to learn come to pass the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.010
 same tests as the older ones but with 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.330
 another totally different attitude 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.140
 we want to be very didactic with them 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.670
 that they teach us to us 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.260
 teach them also but that we 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.360
 transmit those values ​​that the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 children what is that is the ability to 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 learn are sponges the ability to 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.750
 surprise us that shine in the eyes that 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.890
 be transmitted to us because today with 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.360
 the times that are running 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.540
 that positive attitude that attitude of 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.519
 learn to be creative in overcoming 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.559
 challenges and taking iron from others 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.330
 I think it's good and if it's 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.180
 important that they teach us and other things 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.580
 there are children pushed by their parents or they 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 really notice that enthusiasm among 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.090
 chosen 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.470
 it is clear that a child needs support 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.810
 of the parents and needs a little bit then 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.640
 the supervision of parents in certain 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.960
 way in the junior masters we will be a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.370
 little his parents 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.470
 we will try so that they do not hurt themselves 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.119
 that they do not have to be in danger but 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.890
 turn them to be themselves and that we 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.110
 teach then those things that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.450
 you really want to be perceived when 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 a child does something because he really does 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.280
 like or because they have said is not that I have 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.860
 to do it like that and me in the castings that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.630
 I have witnessed there is no child that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.229
 they would not see the little eyes and that really 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.090
 the kitchen catches your attention or the act 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.040
 of cooking that in the end we do not want either 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.369
 look for the best small chef in Spain 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 but that the young man in the child that 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.310
 show us that cooking is enjoyable is 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.020
 simple and it is an act that must be 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.170
 do because in the end eat we eat 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.170
 everyone 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.700
 tell us about the mechanics of the program 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.510
 many changes regarding the edition 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 of adults 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.230
 well the mechanics are similar 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 they are obviously children and what silo and what 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.040
 we will do according to that fact that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.630
 they are children but I believe that the great 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.130
 differential factor is that it is that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.440
 greater 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.330
 and they tell you that you want to be shares 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.550
 they say they want to know the world of 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.020
 restaurant or professional kitchen 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.780
 because they have not had the option and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.550
 we show it to you with the good and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 with what may be considered not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.500
 so good that is the pressure is the rigor 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.780
 is what the client demands you declared to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.760
 the kids all that we are not going to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.370
 demand we're going to try to be didactic 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 in giving that they learn and as I said 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.060
 at the beginning learn a lot from them 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.390
 because the kids have a lot 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.390
 designers 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.090
 the eliminations are four in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.200
 four and this is an edition 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.200
 pretty short 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.909
 rational in the end are in schools 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.030
 end are children if we want to do something 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.549
 special so to end the year with 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.340
 something entertaining fun and made with 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.579
 seriousness but what do you want 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.160
 we learn to transmit values ​​but with 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.280
 a smile gives 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.690
 there was a moment of reflection or do not doubt 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.820
 in participating in the junior version 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.820
 when the producer proposed it to you 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.470
 We do not like the challenges at all 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.600
 about thinking that I'm not very kids and 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.140
 in the first casting I already had a pipe 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.200
 with them 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.810
 in the end our attention is not to do 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.079
 nothing bad on the contrary taught those of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.540
 kitchen dignify the trade and in turn 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.870
 entertain with a format to the most profit 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.870
 possible
