00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
works very well so I'm just going to put

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
works very well so I'm just going to put
this<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> keep<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.700> on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this and I'm going to keep this all on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
this and I'm going to keep this all on
the<00:01:15.060> lid<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> doesn't<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.560> exact

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the lid this doesn't have to be exact

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
the lid this doesn't have to be exact
but<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:22.200> try<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> make<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> pretty<00:01:22.920> close

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
but I would try to make it pretty close

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
but I would try to make it pretty close
just<00:01:23.490> kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> crease<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> bit

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
just kind of go up in that crease a bit

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.950 
just kind of go up in that crease a bit
and<00:01:25.850> just<00:01:26.850> trying<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> make<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> pretty<00:01:27.540> even

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and just trying to make it pretty even

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
and just trying to make it pretty even
because<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.500> help<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.100> you're

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
