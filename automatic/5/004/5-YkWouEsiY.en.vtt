record the last few kills or the
beginning<00:02:39.070> few<00:02:39.250> kills<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> will<00:02:40.210> show<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
beginning few kills so I will show a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
picture I took with my phone at the end

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.850 
picture I took with my phone at the end
of<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.540> game<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.930> shows<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> nuclear<00:02:44.680> as

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
of the game and it shows a nuclear as

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.980 
of the game and it shows a nuclear as
well<00:02:45.040> as<00:02:45.220> 50<00:02:45.610> UNSTOPABLES<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> nuclear

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
well as 50 UNSTOPABLES and the nuclear

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.310 
well as 50 UNSTOPABLES and the nuclear
is<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.250> 30-30<00:02:48.250> gun<00:02:48.490> streak<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> then<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:50.200> one

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
is a 30-30 gun streak and then for one

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.260 
is a 30-30 gun streak and then for one
unstoppable<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.430> unstoppable<00:02:52.120> for

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
unstoppable you get one unstoppable for

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.870 
unstoppable you get one unstoppable for
every<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:52.690> kill<00:02:52.990> above<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.680> 30<00:02:54.160> gun<00:02:54.460> streak<00:02:54.670> so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
every one kill above a 30 gun streak so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.330 
every one kill above a 30 gun streak so
if<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.060> add<00:02:55.210> 50<00:02:55.990> UNSTOPABLES<00:02:56.680> plus<00:02:57.070> one

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
if you add 50 UNSTOPABLES plus one

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.010 
if you add 50 UNSTOPABLES plus one
nuclear<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.030> an<00:02:58.180> 80<00:02:58.450> gun<00:02:58.720> streak

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020
