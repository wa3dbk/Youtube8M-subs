00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
crowds start to dissipate this time of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.140 
crowds start to dissipate this time of
year<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.740> bonus<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.220> prices<00:02:03.119> for

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
year and as it as a bonus the prices for

a<00:02:03.420> lot<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> occasion<00:02:04.049> Reynolds<00:02:04.350> start<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
a lot of the occasion Reynolds start to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.319 
a lot of the occasion Reynolds start to
drop<00:02:04.829> considerably<00:02:05.460> over<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.970> next<00:02:06.180> couple

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
drop considerably over the next couple

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.479 
drop considerably over the next couple
months<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.810> definitely<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:08.040> time<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.399> be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
months so definitely a good time to be

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.270 
months so definitely a good time to be
down<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.570> have<00:02:09.600> some<00:02:09.840> activity<00:02:10.320> like

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
down here we do have some activity like

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
down here we do have some activity like
I<00:02:11.340> said<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.640> surf<00:02:11.820> doesn't<00:02:12.120> look<00:02:12.209> great<00:02:12.420> today

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I said the surf doesn't look great today

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
I said the surf doesn't look great today
but<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> chance<00:02:14.010> throughout<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
but there is a chance throughout the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.100 
but there is a chance throughout the
rest<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> week<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.540> could<00:02:15.840> pick<00:02:16.079> up

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
rest of the week that it could pick up

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.740 
rest of the week that it could pick up
significantly<00:02:16.920> looks<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.000> Hurricane<00:02:18.510> Irene

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
significantly looks like Hurricane Irene

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.009 
significantly looks like Hurricane Irene
has<00:02:19.350> formed<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:19.950> off<00:02:20.420> Haiti<00:02:21.420> right<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
has formed it's off Haiti right now so

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.900 
has formed it's off Haiti right now so
it's<00:02:22.140> still<00:02:22.320> moving<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:22.980> forecasts

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's still moving up in the forecasts

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.250 
it's still moving up in the forecasts
are<00:02:24.000> still<00:02:24.209> questionable<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.110> sure

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
are still questionable not really sure

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.479 
are still questionable not really sure
where<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.769> head<00:02:25.950> looks<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.370> it

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
where it's going to head looks like it

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.830 
where it's going to head looks like it
could<00:02:26.700> come<00:02:26.910> pretty<00:02:27.090> close<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.660> outer

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
could come pretty close to the outer

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
could come pretty close to the outer
banks<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.950> know<00:02:29.100> only<00:02:29.340> time<00:02:29.610> will<00:02:29.760> tell

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
banks but you know only time will tell

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.490 
banks but you know only time will tell
those<00:02:30.239> hurricane<00:02:30.630> tracks<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.079> change<00:02:31.320> pretty

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
those hurricane tracks can change pretty

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.199 
those hurricane tracks can change pretty
pretty<00:02:32.040> quickly<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.489> pretty<00:02:32.670> significantly

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
pretty quickly and pretty significantly

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.330 
pretty quickly and pretty significantly
so<00:02:33.720> we'll<00:02:33.870> keep<00:02:33.989> an<00:02:34.110> eye<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:34.709> as<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so we'll keep an eye on that but as it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.619 
so we'll keep an eye on that but as it
does<00:02:35.520> get<00:02:35.700> closer<00:02:35.970> looks<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.599> to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
does get closer looks like it's going to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.670 
does get closer looks like it's going to
be<00:02:36.720> towards<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.020> end<00:02:37.110> o<00:02:37.170> week<00:02:37.200> maybe<00:02:37.530> friday

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
be towards the end o week maybe friday

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.770 
be towards the end o week maybe friday
or<00:02:38.129> saturday<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.849> looks<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> surf

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
or saturday and looks like the surf

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.130 
or saturday and looks like the surf
could

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
could

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
could
pick<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.350> significantly<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.550> sure<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
pick up significantly not sure if the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.340 
pick up significantly not sure if the
wind<00:02:42.240> will<00:02:42.390> match<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:42.990> looks<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.260> we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
wind will match but it looks like we

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.480 
wind will match but it looks like we
could<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.680> whole<00:02:43.800> bunch<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.130> swell<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
could have a whole bunch of swell in the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.820 
could have a whole bunch of swell in the
area<00:02:44.760> by<00:02:44.940> Friday<00:02:45.209> or<00:02:45.390> Saturday<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.350> keep<00:02:46.680> an

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
area by Friday or Saturday so we keep an

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.920
