00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
concerns but i think the best guarantee
of<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.729> risk<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> stick<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.810> with

of that is risk to stick with what with

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
tendency at least hit I see it here this

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.550 
tendency at least hit I see it here this
morning<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.480> not<00:03:24.660> unique<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.110> think<00:03:25.410> to

morning but it's not unique I think to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.740 
morning but it's not unique I think to
this<00:03:25.680> particular<00:03:25.890> industry<00:03:26.610> as<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.510> know

this particular industry as you know

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.020 
this particular industry as you know
there's<00:03:28.440> always<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.890> tendency<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.549> use<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
there's always that tendency to use the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.110 
there's always that tendency to use the
system<00:03:30.299> down<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.840> last<00:03:31.140> inch<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:32.610> maximize

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
system down to the last inch to maximize

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.620 
system down to the last inch to maximize
profit<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.459> stock<00:03:35.459> price<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.299> it's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
profit and stock price and so on it's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.570 
profit and stock price and so on it's
human<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.230> mean<00:03:37.650> I'm<00:03:37.739> not<00:03:37.920> suggesting<00:03:38.100> needs<00:03:38.519> to

human I mean I'm not suggesting needs to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.789 
human I mean I'm not suggesting needs to
