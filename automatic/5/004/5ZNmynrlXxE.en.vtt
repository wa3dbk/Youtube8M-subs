00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 today we have the backbone of the tablet 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.990
 computer acer iconia tab w700 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.990
 home game console 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.360
 the fact is that many people have 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.250
 prejudice against home consoles and 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.880
 This is due to the fact that the games for them are 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.130
 expensive 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.650
 they need to patch to do something else and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.540
 Therefore, most players in Russia and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.489
 CIS plays with the help of personal 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 computers but it is not always convenient 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 so today we will spend 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.300
 eccentric transformation experiment 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.629
 windows tablet but home gaming 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.629
 console 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.330
 in the role of the subject stands out from Iraq 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.330
 In the summer of w7 , this one is a tablet 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.040
 it's loaded with the newest intel processor 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.989
 core i5 with intel hd 4000 graphics 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.780
 then pull many modern 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.030
 toys however it won't do right away 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.160
 his home game console needs more 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.800
 few interesting steps in the first 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.330
 queue we brought the image to the monitor 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.100
 behind me 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.530
 all home gaming consoles 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.300
 display the image on the big screen 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.280
 next we used the shops 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.860
 steam that allows you to purchase games 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.140
 and play them on different computers 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.270
 working under linux windows or mac os 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.670
 and of course the same attribute for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.070
 all home game consoles is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.590
 gamepad controller in our case this 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.990
 Once master to triggers your Jan van 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.610
 performed in playstation 3 style from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.490
 Playstation controllers 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.950
 it is distinguished by the presence of two full 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 kurkov 4 full fonts but on 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.759
 front panel standard pretty 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560
 a set of buttons for gamepad times 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.590
 celebrated in games that are compatible 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.399
 only x-box 360 controllers we 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.530
 took advantage 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.720
 emulator it is available on the fan cass site 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.280
 dot org in the section useful software 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.080
 Today we will try several popular 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.989
 games they all worked together perfectly 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.360
 gamepad work through steam are displayed 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.350
 on this one here is the monitor and practically 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 all at 1280 by 720 pixels then 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.640
 there is a standard hd 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390
 or 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 showmetal 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.400
 go to full volume i'm more 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.730
 his foot will compete either 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.060
 still choose about 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.060
 wonderful subaru 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.130
 Once again playing on tablet 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.680
 computer and ussr iconia tab w700 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.310
 calling thrustmaster dual gamepad 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.830
 trigger 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.320
 truleman we offer some Larse 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.750
 Alex she as man for whom we 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.750
 we can follow 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.650
 try to get around on turning people but 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:49.620
 here I lose control and find myself 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.599
 again I try to smoothly leave the tail 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.609
 this is skidding reducing speed on 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.680
 turning so not very well passed it 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.799
 it's all very unusual for me to play 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.590
 racing simulators with gamepad 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.959
 because before that I played for a very long time 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:12.060
 either with the wheel or with the keyboard 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.670
 one of the main advantages in gamepad 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.410
 he allows not to gas 100 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.669
 percent like lets do 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.229
 the keyboard from can be fitted smoothly and 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.889
 so do not lose controllability 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.889
 the car 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.930
 Well, unfortunately, I'm in fourth place, but 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.810
 there was no goal to win 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.810
 so for now, we agree with that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.810
 0 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.530
 minisinks 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 geely 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.270
 milly mally 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.680
 great 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.949
 but also 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.710
 me 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.160
 but not 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.440
 maybe 1 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.290
 Well, we understand how it is played soon 2 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.130
 trailer 2 on acer tablet computer 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.260
 iconia tab w700 and be different 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.550
 so we have a famous game 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.130
 borderlands 2 on we have the plot here 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.750
 such an adventure shootout may 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.500
 last a very long time for the reason that 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.090
 not found damn far and in them so 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.120
 just can't get there they already started 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.220
 throw grenades 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.310
 remove it comfortable incendiary 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.260
 a gun here we have shown that 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.260
 this is probably what we were looking for a cross between 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.710
 accept 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.320
 they are so hardcore on 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.129
 uk words 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.719
 I think now you know exactly what 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.840
 play borderlands 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.389
 on an ester iconia w7 tablet computer 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.000
 if you suddenly decide to make 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.310
 tablet pc something like 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.819
 home game console so before 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.520
 us 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.560
 toy which is called trayan 2 she 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.750
 talks about three heroes and 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.159
 magic artifact which is called 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.050
 triple unfortunately I have cubes 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.889
 pretty small and i can create 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.889
 only one die 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:04.080
 could highlight 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:07.169
 gate what if i create a drawer here 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.930
 which will stand here and in one 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:16.349
 I will climb here carve gigantic 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:18.210
 Does the fly now cheer us out of the water in 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:20.539
 which we boil weird 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.650
 soap bubbles can be normal 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:24.650
 climb up
