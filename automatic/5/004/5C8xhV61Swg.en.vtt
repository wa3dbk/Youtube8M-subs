where I am well in the United States I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
where I am well in the United States I
knew<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> basic

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
knew that I was on all of the basic

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
knew that I was on all of the basic
medications<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.880> pay<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.330> tried

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
medications that they pay out I've tried

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.849 
medications that they pay out I've tried
the<00:00:28.470> Avonex<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> Copaxone<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the Avonex in the Copaxone and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
the Avonex in the Copaxone and
everything<00:00:32.360> has<00:00:33.360> been<00:00:33.510> exhausted<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
everything has been exhausted it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.290 
everything has been exhausted it
actually<00:00:34.980> hasn't<00:00:35.190> been<00:00:35.489> proven<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.180> be

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
actually hasn't been proven to be

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
actually hasn't been proven to be
effective<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:37.050> people<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.559> secondary

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
effective with people with secondary

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.299 
effective with people with secondary
progressive<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> went<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> my

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
progressive and so when I went to my

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.650 
progressive and so when I went to my
doctor<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:43.260> Dallas<00:00:43.739> she<00:00:44.520> basically<00:00:45.000> said<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
doctor a in Dallas she basically said in

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
doctor a in Dallas she basically said in
the<00:00:45.780> United<00:00:46.079> States<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.710> nothing<00:00:47.100> else

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the United States they have nothing else

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
the United States they have nothing else
that<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.879> offer<00:00:48.030> me<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.320> point

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that they can offer me at this point

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.590 
that they can offer me at this point
except<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> switch<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> another<00:00:51.149> drug

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
except for the switch to another drug

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
except for the switch to another drug
and<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.489> knew<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.270> time<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and so we just knew that it was time to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.290 
and so we just knew that it was time to
reach<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.460> find<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.820> different<00:00:57.000> direction

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
reach out and find a different direction

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
reach out and find a different direction
I've<00:00:58.260> even<00:00:58.680> done<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> chemo<00:00:59.449> before<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> knock

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I've even done the chemo before to knock

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
I've even done the chemo before to knock
down<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.760> pms<00:01:02.760> symptoms<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:04.250> nothing<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
down the pms symptoms and nothing it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
down the pms symptoms and nothing it
might<00:01:06.180> slow<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.900> progression<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.710> but

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
might slow down the progression but but

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.620 
might slow down the progression but but
it<00:01:08.400> definitely<00:01:08.580> doesn't<00:01:08.970> stop<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it definitely doesn't stop the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
it definitely doesn't stop the
progression<00:01:11.360> i<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.810> i<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.590> using<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.310> walker

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
progression i was i was using a walker

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
progression i was i was using a walker
and<00:01:15.920> struggling<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.700> every<00:01:18.119> step<00:01:18.689> i<00:01:19.020> mean

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and struggling with every step i mean

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
and struggling with every step i mean
just<00:01:19.560> every<00:01:19.830> step<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> i<00:01:20.340> took<00:01:20.460> i<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.060> really

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
just every step that i took i was really

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.260 
just every step that i took i was really
at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:23.220> knowing<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.700> i<00:01:23.790> could<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
at the not knowing if i could make the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.749 
at the not knowing if i could make the
next<00:01:24.450> effort<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> i<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.159> ready<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
next effort at all and i was ready to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.020 
next effort at all and i was ready to
look<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.630> maybe<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> scooter<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.820> type<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
look for maybe a scooter or some type of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
look for maybe a scooter or some type of
a<00:01:30.390> wheelchair<00:01:31.049> which<00:01:31.200> i<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.220> want

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
