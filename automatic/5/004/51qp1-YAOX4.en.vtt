other building in the country you know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.109 
other building in the country you know
we're<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> blue-collar<00:01:28.860> town<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
we're we're a blue-collar town and I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.719 
we're we're a blue-collar town and I
think<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> big<00:01:30.990> comparison<00:01:31.500> between

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
think there's a big comparison between

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
think there's a big comparison between
the<00:01:32.729> blue-collar<00:01:33.329> work<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.470> team<00:01:34.710> does

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the blue-collar work that this team does

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and the community itself I think we've

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
and the community itself I think we've
made<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> name<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.220> ourselves<00:01:38.630> hopefully

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
made a name for ourselves hopefully
