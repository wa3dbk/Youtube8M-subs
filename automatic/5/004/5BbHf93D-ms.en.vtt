bobbin case a little notch which goes up
in<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:21.359> direction<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.289> want<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> take<00:00:22.710> your

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
in this direction you want to take your

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
in this direction you want to take your
thread<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.430> comes<00:00:23.640> over<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.240> bobbin<00:00:26.330> place

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
thread as it comes over the bobbin place

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.589 
thread as it comes over the bobbin place
it<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.640> then<00:00:29.640> pull<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> stops

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it in and then pull it into the stops

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.540 
it in and then pull it into the stops
because<00:00:30.840> you're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> pull<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.349> back

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
because you're going to pull it back

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
because you're going to pull it back
where<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:32.910> clump<00:00:33.239> pressure<00:00:34.040> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
where it's a little clump pressure and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.119 
where it's a little clump pressure and
you<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> locking<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.770> under<00:00:37.770> your<00:00:37.829> tab

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you get it locking in under your tab

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.619 
you get it locking in under your tab
there's<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> screw<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.510> an

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
there's a screw here for just an

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.229 
there's a screw here for just an
attention<00:00:40.340> should<00:00:41.340> hold<00:00:41.579> itself<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
attention should hold itself with a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.110 
attention should hold itself with a
little<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> tension<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
little bit of tension and as for the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.369 
little bit of tension and as for the
Machine<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:48.000> spool<00:00:48.300> pins<00:00:48.570> back<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
Machine the spool pins back here you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.020 
Machine the spool pins back here you
also<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.980> loop<00:00:50.960> another<00:00:51.960> thread<00:00:52.350> guide<00:00:53.030> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
also have a loop another thread guide of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.770 
also have a loop another thread guide of
course<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.750> thread<00:00:55.379> tension<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.420> couple

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
course your thread tension and a couple

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.349 
course your thread tension and a couple
more<00:00:57.899> guides<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.530> work<00:00:58.770> our<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.359> so

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
more guides as we work our way down so

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.020 
more guides as we work our way down so
four<00:01:00.629> starts<00:01:00.989> we'll<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.410> spool<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
four starts we'll put our spool on and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.870 
four starts we'll put our spool on and
we'll<00:01:03.390> hit<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.719> rear<00:01:03.989> guide<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.430> basically

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we'll hit this rear guide and basically

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
we'll hit this rear guide and basically
you're<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.060> coming<00:01:06.390> over<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> hook<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you're just coming over the hook and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.609 
you're just coming over the hook and
you're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.930> left<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.170> through<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you're going left to right through the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.750 
you're going left to right through the
hook<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:12.049> downward<00:01:13.520> put<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> little

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hook and then downward put a little

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.560 
hook and then downward put a little
thumb<00:01:15.060> pressure<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:16.439> sure<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:17.570> presser

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
thumb pressure on make sure your presser

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.740 
thumb pressure on make sure your presser
foots<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.970> then<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.330> your

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
foots up and then you go through your

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.460 
foots up and then you go through your
disks<00:01:23.840> om<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:25.939> thread<00:01:26.939> tensioner<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.020> then

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
disks om your thread tensioner and then

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.960 
disks om your thread tensioner and then
pull<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.939> there's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:31.790> there's<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pull up there's a little there's a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
pull up there's a little there's a
little<00:01:33.299> notch<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> get

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
little notch right here you want to get

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
little notch right here you want to get
into<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:37.159> then<00:01:38.159> our<00:01:38.310> thread<00:01:38.610> goes<00:01:38.930> through

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
into and then our thread goes through

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.280 
into and then our thread goes through
this<00:01:41.329> little<00:01:42.329> holder<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.320> then

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
showing you the thread take-up there but

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.850 
showing you the thread take-up there but
I<00:02:03.010> came<00:02:03.280> through<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.640> thread<00:02:03.880> take-up<00:02:04.860> going

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
I came through the thread take-up going

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.680 
I came through the thread take-up going
right<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.220> left<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> now<00:02:08.650> we<00:02:08.710> come<00:02:09.010> down<00:02:09.690> we've

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
right to left and now we come down we've

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.690 
right to left and now we come down we've
got<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.900> loop<00:02:11.110> here<00:02:11.380> where<00:02:11.620> we're<00:02:11.770> going<00:02:12.070> left

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
got a loop here where we're going left

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.260 
got a loop here where we're going left
to<00:02:12.850> right<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.540> clip<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.850> then<00:02:19.060> there's

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
to right to clip it in and then there's

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.080 
to right to clip it in and then there's
a<00:02:19.360> series<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:23.220> thread<00:02:24.220> guides<00:02:24.490> towards<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
a series of thread guides towards the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.510 
a series of thread guides towards the
bottom<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.510> first<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.990> here<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.260> a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
bottom here the first one here is a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.500 
bottom here the first one here is a
curlicue<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.640> basically<00:02:33.640> just<00:02:33.940> come<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.300> from

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
curlicue and basically just come in from

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.690 
curlicue and basically just come in from
the<00:02:34.600> back<00:02:34.780> side<00:02:36.510> pull<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.540> forward<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.080> down

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the back side pull it forward and down

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.760 
the back side pull it forward and down
then<00:02:39.700> you've<00:02:39.880> got<00:02:40.090> another<00:02:40.360> loop<00:02:40.630> at<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> top

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
then you've got another loop at the top

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.240 
then you've got another loop at the top
of<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> needle<00:02:42.640> bar<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.620> you're<00:02:44.620> going<00:02:44.950> from

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
of the needle bar and you're going from

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.180 
of the needle bar and you're going from
front<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.610> back<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:47.650> there's<00:02:47.860> one

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
