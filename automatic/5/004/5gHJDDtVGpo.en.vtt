00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.339
 so the staff is hopefully the quality 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 audio is a little better here 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 although hopefully not windy 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.000
 make lots of noise is just giving 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.570
 continuity, we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.670
 more about the difficulty in prayer is I 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.199
 I'll talk quickly I'm preparing 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.859
 here a surprise for the next 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.170
 weeks 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.560
 so the next videos will come out more 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.900
 dialogues and but today I did not want to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 stop having video is today is today is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 Sunday I'm recording on launch day. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 the video but I do not want to save 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.300
 fidelity so far I've never said no 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 I want to fail again with you then 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 I'll talk quickly today, the video I hope. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.280
 know shorter but come on 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 about difficulty in prayer life 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 a very common difficulty that occurs 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 Are people sleeping in prayer? 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.660
 A lot of people say that they are asleep. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 that it is only to make the sign of the cross that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 sleep that the person can deal with and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 that's how it works 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.110
 the first thing I want to say 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 stay calm about this, do not worry 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 sound is something natural god was who 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
 created he knows our weaknesses 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.400
 body and god is not will not stay 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.840
 upset because you slept in prayer 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 Now I'm citing you, but you? 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.189
 then looking in his bible in the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 gospel of john 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.400
 after the last supper jesus goes out with the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.250
 disciples and will pray is that scene that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.770
 jesus is anguished garden of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 olive trees he stopped circulating praying 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.579
 and the disciples sleep, and for two 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.869
 Sometimes Jesus returns the first time 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.659
 jesus come back 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.340
 he looks at the disciples and says so 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.689
 if you can not wake up one hour to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.250
 People wake up if they can not do it. 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.860
 one hour 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 Wake up, wake up , let's pray 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.689
 because the thing're hard for me to clear 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 that he said so, but I'm making of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 a more conversational form, let's say 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.409
 So Jesus returns to pray when Jesus 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.320
 come back the second time jesus does not wake up 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.830
 disciples that touched me a lot because 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.280
 jesus looks at him and it competes for them 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.069
 one more time it 's you 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.060
 sleep again, but now there's no more 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.720
 What to do 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.030
 The time has come and then Jesus sees those 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.819
 approaching and aids wakes up 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.840
 because those who came to arrest me already 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.790
 They came and they are already there it is for me this is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.830
 very remarkable because Jesus does not condemn 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.380
 When you decide if you can not 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.470
 To realize one hour we do not have 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.450
 disappointed even because they had 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.580
 just finished eating them 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.950
 had wine and Alex for the first time 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.510
 they are not Hungarian and the blood of 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.850
 sir but he was full of belly 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 they were tired it was late 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 night they slept jesus did not get 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.130
 disappoints them because they slept 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.130
 but jesus also the rope is what is the tip 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.390
 What do I give to you sleeping here? 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.340
 I want to say that I also give 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.940
 in prayer this is a great consolation for 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.620
 you 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.930
 Saint Therese also slept in prayer 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.970
 her staff then if santa terezinha 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.980
 she slept in her personal prayer and she went 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.350
 santa my friend and you we can 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.910
 Do not worry, either. 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.070
 relation to inventory 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.250
 so the tip I give the following is 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.209
 Are you sleepy try to try to pray? 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 walking 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.799
 There are some people who can get a 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.329
 room just for you to pray get up 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.790
 from one side to the other is the 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.930
 God is higher when you read aloud you 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.670
 react try to interact I talked in a video 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.880
 about praying with the word of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.489
 God if you interact with the word 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.890
 God you use your imagination if you 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.450
 to really put oneself in prayer is more 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.600
 difficult to actually sleep 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.850
 if you 're just sit and stay 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.739
 trying to wait for a motion of the spirit 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.920
 Saint suddenly saw you really go 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.350
 you will sleep to get work 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.970
 else is worth also once 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.620
 in when I can not get up 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.859
 will wash the face and continue the fight 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.680
 being awake to pray is also very 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:15.400
 valid because it will strengthen your 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.340
 decision I have a decision for god and the 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.239
 And this time it's for god I will not do it. 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.759
 nothing more but to be here before 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.160
 God is with probe I will not surrender 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:30.300
 sleep because god is more than mine 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.389
 Sleep understands is not an is and is not not 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.710
 You need to waste time asking for forgiveness. 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.289
 Why do you sleep? 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.509
 sometimes we sleep god 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.370
 forgiveness and sleep I did not go cover 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.740
 Then you start to accuse yourself 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.300
 knows how god knows 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.050
 if you sleep back where you 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.800
 It was and continues though forward 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 Understand, I think what's more 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.349
 important to realize is that sleeping is not 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840
 an extraordinary thing 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.599
 sleeping is something that is natural at all 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.860
 jesus human being had sleep again 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.710
 that passage 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.960
 jesus was in the park and slept in the middle 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.990
 of the storm 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.669
 Jesus, what is Jesus' problem? 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.569
 what is fatigue jesus knows that you are 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.949
 you tired you can sleep without 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.840
 feel condemned by him 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.949
 what can not is you just get 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.440
 to sleep 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.120
 simply let sleep take over and 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.169
 stay for it 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.590
 so that's the word I'm telling you now 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.710
 courage determined determination i 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.479
 I want to be detained and then you sing 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.219
 pray with the highest word of God 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.560
 You walk inside your room if you 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.570
 to get a more spacious place 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.190
 for more space and you talk to 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.960
 Jesus, it's okay, so this video is me 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.940
 I'm going to record a little bit shorter than 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.430
 last but I want to leave it a lot 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.430
 of course you do not worry 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.919
