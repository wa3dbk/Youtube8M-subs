going to look at the different zones and
how<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> achieve<00:00:08.880> different<00:00:09.269> land<00:00:09.660> values<00:00:10.019> in

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
how to achieve different land values in

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.030 
how to achieve different land values in
a<00:00:10.260> city<00:00:12.259> after<00:00:13.259> we've<00:00:13.440> built<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> foundation

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a city after we've built the foundation

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.490 
a city after we've built the foundation
of<00:00:14.580> our<00:00:14.670> new<00:00:14.849> city<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.509> part<00:00:15.780> with

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
of our new city in the first part with

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.099 
of our new city in the first part with
main<00:00:16.710> roads<00:00:17.010> power<00:00:17.520> water<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:18.869> few

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
main roads power water and the first few

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
main roads power water and the first few
zones<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.910> fill<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.210> those

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
zones we can now start to fill in those

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.990 
zones we can now start to fill in those
gaps<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:22.199> small<00:00:22.470> streets<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.789> about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
gaps with small streets and think about

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
gaps with small streets and think about
the<00:00:24.180> more<00:00:24.359> detailed<00:00:24.810> layout<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.410> our<00:00:25.560> city<00:00:27.949> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the more detailed layout of our city the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.890 
the more detailed layout of our city the
best<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> grow<00:00:29.789> those<00:00:29.970> small<00:00:30.240> streets<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
best way to grow those small streets is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.229 
best way to grow those small streets is
to<00:00:31.410> orientate<00:00:31.949> yourself<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> grids<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to orientate yourself on the grids that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
to orientate yourself on the grids that
you<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> floor<00:00:34.050> those<00:00:34.829> show<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you see on the floor those show you the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
you see on the floor those show you the
ideal<00:00:35.820> distance<00:00:36.329> between<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> different

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
ideal distance between the different

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
ideal distance between the different
roads<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> most<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.850> zoning

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
roads to get the most out of your zoning

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
roads to get the most out of your zoning
later<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.800> draw<00:00:41.040> them<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.430> close

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
later on if you draw them to close

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
later on if you draw them to close
bigger<00:00:42.600> buildings<00:00:43.020> won't<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.440> any<00:00:43.590> place<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
bigger buildings won't have any place to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
bigger buildings won't have any place to
grow<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.210> draw<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.539> too<00:00:45.750> far<00:00:46.020> away<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
grow if you draw them too far away of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
grow if you draw them too far away of
each<00:00:46.530> other<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.760> unused

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
each other there will be some unused

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.080 
each other there will be some unused
space<00:00:49.250> remember<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.340> Club<00:00:50.610> built<00:00:50.850> like

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
space remember that Club built like

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.900 
space remember that Club built like
schools<00:00:51.480> hospitals<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> need<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> bit

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
schools hospitals and so on need a bit

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.480 
schools hospitals and so on need a bit
more<00:00:53.940> space<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.079> expanded<00:00:55.440> later

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.000 

let's<00:01:03.150> put<00:01:03.360> some<00:01:03.540> residential<00:01:03.960> zones<00:01:04.350> here

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.290 

now<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.310> made<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:08.850> big<00:01:09.180> your

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
now that we made our first big your

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.120 
now that we made our first big your
neighborhood<00:01:09.690> we<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.260> decide<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.830> land

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
value we're targeting for this part of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.620 
value we're targeting for this part of
the<00:01:13.230> town<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:14.640> set<00:01:14.970> her<00:01:15.150> wealthy<00:01:15.510> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
sims are to move into this zone you can

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.610 
sims are to move into this zone you can
see<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.480> there<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.870> some<00:01:19.050> demand<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.590> a
