00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
two sides of that stitch you know my
fingers<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.350> wonky<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.920> put<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
fingers got all wonky there put that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.280 
fingers got all wonky there put that
through<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> bring<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> yarn<00:01:10.799> over

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
through I'm going to bring the yarn over

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.719 
through I'm going to bring the yarn over
so<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.799> bring<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> through<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so that I can just bring it through like

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
so that I can just bring it through like
that<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.600> fail<00:01:15.900> swoop<00:01:16.130> with<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> slip

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that and one fail swoop with a slip

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.030 
that and one fail swoop with a slip
stitch<00:01:17.869> now<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> bottom<00:01:19.830> half

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
stitch now you see that the bottom half

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.480 
stitch now you see that the bottom half
of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> stitch<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:21.540> together<00:01:21.890> but<00:01:22.890> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
of the stitch is not together but this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.260 
of the stitch is not together but this
essentially<00:01:24.150> closes<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> makes<00:01:25.409> our<00:01:25.619> loop

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
essentially closes and makes our loop

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.960 
essentially closes and makes our loop
and<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.509> will<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.900> later<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.799> we'll<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.820> our

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and what will do later is we'll use our

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
and what will do later is we'll use our
tail<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.280> stitch<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:32.880> two

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tail and we will stitch these two

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
tail and we will stitch these two
together<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.930> looks<00:01:34.430> connected

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
together so that that looks connected

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.929 
together so that that looks connected
fully<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.259> from<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.939> we

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
fully so what we do from here is we

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
fully so what we do from here is we
chain<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.740> we're<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> skip<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
chain one we're going to skip this

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.620 
chain one we're going to skip this
stitch<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.350> connector<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.630> slip

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
stitch that our connector and slip

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.100 
stitch that our connector and slip
stitch<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.340> attached<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.960> we're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
stitch is attached to and we're going to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.460 
stitch is attached to and we're going to
yarn<00:01:49.409> over<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:50.159> into<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.790> next<00:01:51.000> stitch<00:01:51.470> go
