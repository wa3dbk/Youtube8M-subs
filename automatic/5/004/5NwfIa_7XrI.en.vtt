00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.040
 the staff then let's show the tip to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.680
 you do not 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.900
 We'll order with radiator here already. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.969
 I knew a little here. Let's practice. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.679
 with a dirty radiator was used 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.630
 there about four five six months and then 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.260
 assemble each talent on it as it is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 will make a suggestion if you have not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.269
 did not want to wet so well 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.039
 I would do this here, just do the following if 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:35.420
 it was a little while here to raise a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.420
 little powder the hair you get 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.739
 together here with this is another roll in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.739
 little hand 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
 rolls 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 ready now you 're going to get this little 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350
 It will pass and that's how it is. 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 do not take everything here 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 and put it all together in Rome after at the robin 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.280
 Cutting is going already okay already 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.140
 Leave it all here, I'll add one more. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 the 13th with this objective is 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.330
 start from the side of there and leave everything alone 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.990
 It seems pretty cool magic , huh? 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.160
 Little bit, then, let's not go. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.160
 forget to wash your hand in 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.290
 O difference 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 did not go out there 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.590
 fully what this corner here already 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.590
 was clean or dirty as it was 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.490
 So that's it folks, now, just give the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.490
 fine adjustment here
