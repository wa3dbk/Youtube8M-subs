00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.530
 today so for registration 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.550
 active dominated season 5 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.670
 So it's Sunday, April 12th 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.460
 2015 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.200
 to 14 hours once I ask the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.580
 players to arrive kind 20 to 30 minutes 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.980
 before around 13h40 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.090
 we start to make the teams for not 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.400
 that we waste too much time and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.579
 really starts at 14h 14h10 it will be 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.860
 well it will be intimate of 5 so I 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.690
 lets you look at the rules in the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.670
 description we are going to go see them 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.260
 just now so to register 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.210
 it's very simple you have to answer to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.069
 a form that is really not one 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.719
 there are not many questions I have 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:49.129
 tried to reduce it not take that 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.109
 you are taking a lot of time so 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.399
 first way and teams the style 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.199
 you like it a lot but good 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.510
 we never did they have to 5 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.219
 the cat who never said no to solo 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.409
 but good solo game I do not like too much 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.059
 finally I prefer that it is in team 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.379
 of two three or four he will surely 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.630
 a solo season that will arrive soon them 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.150
 so do not worry about it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.159
 will be the type of team and five 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.370
 with seven types of 5 like that is 35 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.320
 players it's not too much and not good enough 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.820
 So you have to tick either if 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.440
 you are alone in the soft and intimate sense 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.190
 that because I will do I would have 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.380
 maybe three or four teams 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.690
 people who are solo so if he 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.220
 are subscribers here present you are 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 all alone down register a solo and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.200
 then you will put with others 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.300
 people be like that you can 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.010
 make a last game but very surely 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 six or seven people in these little ones 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.650
 because I know there will be 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.440
 people who will not be there so I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 would provide the replacements for you and 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.530
 and then if you are a substitute for 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.600
 disbursement sure to play because on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 the five players I think a sheet at 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.650
 least one or two who will not be there I 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 you will add skype so put your 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.900
 grocer that after you switch to our 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.790
 tools you fill 7 7 15 that if 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.030
 you checked team of 5 otherwise it serves 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.980
 to come where you can put one if 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 you people would take it at the worst yeah 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.740
 but you are a tool even if you put 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
 solo but hey it's not the most 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 important this not very serious so if these 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.800
 serious damage premium and Skype 's 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.000
 so you put yourself for example 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.110
