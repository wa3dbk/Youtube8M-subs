00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.920
 hey , hey, people here are crazy and today we are going 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.349
 bring the video of so requested and recording 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.719
 homemade hair that will leave your hair super 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:18.369
 soft and silky if you want to watch it 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.810
 I just saw kisses then we like 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.490
 I already said I was very excited to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.380
 make this video like you see it 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.449
 I'm not excited, right? 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.910
 And you, I'll tell you what first. 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.460
 Do you need a glass in one? 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.439
 cup that can be a cup a song 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.660
 so you can mix if you need 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.720
 a spoon or a spatula again 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.880
 to be able to mix and a conditioner 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.560
 of your choice I took the one that already 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.690
 I was here at the home of the sertanistas 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.910
 intense but again a conditioner 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.800
 normal if you want to take a 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.270
 treatment even better but if you have not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 can be a conditioner 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.620
 we'll use it at the time honey leaves 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.250
 hair more silky and hydrated and with 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.300
 much brighter and we'll also use 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.750
 along with honey the oil the oil serves 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.640
 because it is naturally a moisturizer 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.220
 very very powerful with dry hair 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.310
 that will help you get that 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.190
 feel your hair and need to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 a cut or anything like that 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.710
 can do this hydration or with a 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.080
 conditioner or with an air conditioner. 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.050
 treatment as I had already said or 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.840
 kneading an avocado that first step 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.880
 using one of the three components is the same 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.230
 I got my normal conditioner 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.720
 I put it in the glass 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.900
 now I'll get three spoons of honey 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.870
 and also put next to the glass 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.400
 now I'll get two spoons or two 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.220
 three spoons of olive oil there I put 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.390
 three but it can be two and I'm going too 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 put in the same container 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.070
 once all this is done it forms a 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.790
 Super mishap with a bad face but can 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.610
 can mix normal that will get something 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.950
 with a more or less similar texture 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.570
 You 'll see soon enough and you can stay 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.429
 calm oil honey will not be 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.020
 hard to get out of your hair exactly 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.010
 because we are mixing them with 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.959
 the conditioned 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.370
 By the time she came, my hair was 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.810
 supertranquil line 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.209
 so when I'm more or less 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.060
 that that way you had your hair 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.220
 in two sessions and each session of these 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.720
 you will split into two other sessions 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.010
 So if you're going to split your hair into 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.810
 four pieces in lock you I will going 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.900
 Why not spoon? 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.989
 when I put a spoon on I go 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.220
 passing in the wick and as I went 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.590
 thinking you need a little more 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 I'll put you need a little less 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590
 I already put it a little neutral. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.569
 you go 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.629
 measuring how much you need so that 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.760
 mew is very moist and you feel that the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.540
 and dating it is uniform in all 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.239
 wires 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.280
 what advice you do not pass are 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.379
 Seeing that I pulled all the hair to 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.739
 facing all the children because 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.599
 I do not like to pass this is good. 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.849
 stuck to the roots, you see that I am 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.170
 then leaving 10 cm root 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.209
 Where am I going to start at? 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.579
 hair that I think is healthier for 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.859
 its root one thing that I forgot to 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.870
 talk to us is the following you go 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.430
 measure the amount of conditioner or 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.040
 treatment condition that you will 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.139
 place about how you 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.790
 uses in the bath puts more or less 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.489
 double when how much you 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.099
 usually by remembering that if you 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.459
 want to use avocado is an avocado 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.989
 usually you will take the lump 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.190
 and will knead his content 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.169
 Now you see I passed the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.250
 my first half of the head in these 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.260
 two wicks 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.840
 now I'm going to get the top of the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.980
 hair and do the same thing by splitting 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.690
 in the middle and passing the content across 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:59.440
 mecha leaving the root a little without 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.109
 contact with hydration people will stay 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.699
 garmin because it is the one in which 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.109
 unfortunately you have to do more 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.109
 end result is worth it 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.659
 What am I doing now? 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.909
 I played all my hair 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.559
 let it loose and how I think the 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.599
 my accounts are much drier than 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:54.819
 than in any other part of the hair and 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.189
 but I do not want to waste any 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.860
 of the treatment that we did to people 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.799
 will get this little bit will release the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.529
 hair and will pass with more intensity 

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:07.839
 on the tips for those who treat the action 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.129
 very potent especially in the 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.129
 of the hair you need 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.819
 now you're going to get all your hair and 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.189
 next to him in a normal coke 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.739
 just because you're going to have to put it all together 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.839
 him to put him in a play which 

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:26.169
 It happens that the ideal is for you to have a cap 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.360
 to put on your hair more 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.189
 you do not have you can use a bag 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.399
 plastic that is what I use to talk to 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.860
 Truly a plastic grocery bag 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:40.779
 normal store you put it in your 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.369
 head will look very chic and it's the 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.559
 The way I have to learn is the 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:48.069
 Next you pick up on his straps. 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:51.639
 twisting and then tucking in 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.319
 to help only after they put a clamp 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.809
 without an entrepreneur just to stay 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.360
 holding you tight because you will be left with 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.759
 the cap or with a bag of hair in your 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.009
 head for at least 30 minutes 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.199
 This is the time that I like for you. 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.009
 let it do a very good effect and you 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.149
 can 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:12.969
 during that time reciting sheik romeu 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:15.249
 Julieta or what about playing a 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.879
 neighborhood more consistent with a mask 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:21.219
 from venice at last you just have to wait for the 30 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:24.069
 and when we are having 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.869
 last you will see well in the bath and 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.840
 wash normally 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:31.230
 we will see 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.940
 so girls here, my hair and I know 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.290
 that he normally and has heard children 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.030
 after I took out that one thousand tubes of 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.820
 super fashion of the head is as follows 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.120
 bath film bath shower usually goes by 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.290
 shampoo well to get the best 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.010

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.010

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.460
 it's here in the hair and we really do 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:00.270
 to feel such a gross difference ' 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.010
 so the hair is much softer 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.350
 because what happens i tried my 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.210

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.639
 Rope when I try to head face 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.910
 baling the packaging is something that 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.350
 leaves his son very dry so he was 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.450
 feeling even needed a 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.790

 spent a little more of the product too 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.479
 but yes and winners I finally approved 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.550
