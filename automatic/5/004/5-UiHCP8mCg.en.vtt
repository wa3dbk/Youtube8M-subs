00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
concept here is if I want to use a

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.010 
concept here is if I want to use a
camera<00:01:40.630> my<00:01:41.440> first<00:01:41.800> judge<00:01:42.070> job<00:01:42.690> who's<00:01:43.690> bent<00:01:43.900> the

camera my first judge job who's bent the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.180 
camera my first judge job who's bent the
camera<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.590> unlocks<00:01:45.070> them<00:01:45.510> okay<00:01:47.010> so<00:01:48.010> they're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
camera and unlocks them okay so they're

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.820 
camera and unlocks them okay so they're
gonna<00:01:48.400> save<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.970> camera<00:01:49.210> quite<00:01:49.600> nice<00:01:52.830> weave

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
gonna save the camera quite nice weave

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.220 
gonna save the camera quite nice weave
so<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:54.910> you<00:01:55.030> dive<00:01:55.210> into<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.600> camera<00:01:55.840> where<00:01:56.140> was

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
so if you dive into the camera where was

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.250 
so if you dive into the camera where was
I<00:01:56.320> going<00:01:56.350> there<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> lobster<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.750> dive<00:01:58.960> into<00:01:59.140> the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
I going there a lobster we dive into the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.090 
I going there a lobster we dive into the
camera<00:01:59.500> we've<00:01:59.740> also<00:01:59.950> added<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.610> feature<00:02:01.030> called

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
camera we've also added a feature called

camera we've also added a feature called
instant<00:02:03.100> capture<00:02:03.520> which<00:02:04.060> means<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.510> you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
instant capture which means that you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.530
