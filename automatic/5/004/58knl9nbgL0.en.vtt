00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.930
 I welcome you to hot stuff from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 Last time we know that the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.050
 Wheels of tune fed by hand 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 be pressed down and perfectly centered 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.699
 now we take nevertheless simply times the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.279
 tsr 22 and the tsr 30 more precisely under the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 magnifying glass 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.710
 basically can tune wheels 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.879
 according to the wishes of the customers 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 be composed 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.300
 we want the tsr 30 and tsr 22 something 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 have a closer look at permanents 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.239
 like the tunes with 70 and mac 170 and the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.549
 proven de store saving saab im 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.409
 distinguish this wheelset as well 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:53.640
 like the light stable and 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:57.120
 aerodynamic tsr rim with 30 mm height 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.000
 the with 70 front fork with 20 hole 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.979
 and the mac 170 rear hub with 24 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.549
 hole impress with appealing 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.850
 design 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:08.159
 but also proven stability the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 black anodized kpm de leit spokes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.549
 underline the concept ideally of tsr 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 22 comes as the name already 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.390
 let assume 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 in contrast to the tsr 30 with a rim 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 height of 22 millimeters therefore the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 further compilation can also be here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 individually selected 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.320
 in our wheelset are similar 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.369
 components as selected in ts er 30 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.420
 These are the quality differences 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.189
 barely noticeable 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.409
 only the weight is different 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.549
 both wheels still set clearly the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.450
 tsr 22 brings about 1,300 54 grams 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.880
 the balance with the tsr 30 with 1421 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.690
 gram can not quite keep up

 small rage on the tsr 22 das 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.210
 maximum weight should not exceed 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.430
 85 kilograms 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.970
 yes, what else is there to say there 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.740
 actually no wish open 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.429
 that was it from us and see you 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.429
 next time
