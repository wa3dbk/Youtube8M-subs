00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 greetings third part of the videos on how to solve the rubik cube 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.120
 lump therefore the bed is much better 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.569
 the objective 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:10.639
 of the 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.109
 third step 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.159
 is to place them 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.529
 2 corner 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.119
 coloma nothing would have left 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.099
 green line line 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.150
 green line peking mining analysts 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.890
 in those cities 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.669
 iñaki narros 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.259
 asprodema oneto 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.010
 to do this we go to the two prefabricated pro bird movements 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.920
 I had mentioned earlier 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.150
 the first movement 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 the first movement the next 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 I'm going to do it with this corner the first movement 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.820
 is to exploit the corners but it is not this that I do not like 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.740
 broken the corner 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.000
 crémer movement 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.170
 and seeing it this month we are seeing it in front 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.130
 bao the corner 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 white val but we have full wife 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.410
 lomu egg 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.780
 to the opposite side 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 he came back 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.270
 and now monte crosta moacir to give you the view of the obvious fact for 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.670
 to be able to see it like that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.710
 Likewise 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.140
 no less he 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.480
 oquendo 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.790
 low 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 the filomena if they are missing 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 broken to the right play to the left 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 he came back 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.120
 under this 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.880
 I returned white 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 3 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.610
 surely they could not see it I can not see it either in the first one is how 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.610
 make other 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 under the white 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980
 going to talk 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.020
 broken left 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.040
 returns blasco pardo assured of this manara the one that wishes 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.980
 under one side 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 the face to the attack I need a piece 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.530
 he stole all the left 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.109
 9º that connect the area 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.959
 roth usually the left 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.199
 returned to the target 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.899
 We are like before each piece 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.309
 good good 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.569
 under the home under the white 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.519
 and three blank 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.519
 well open rotates what motivates you not 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.869
 the other movement 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.869
 it's your beloved fall second move 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.419
 the second movement consisting of percent is much simpler under the 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.319
 corner 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.779
 let's see with this topic 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.859
 lower the corner 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.019
 mulete the left 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.039
 come back the corner 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.319
 the bottom died to walk the track that I 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.359
 wall again the bottom part once again 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.929
 to stay here 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:59.029
 and here is the one that in effect 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.149
 returned to the steering wheel and in mode the bottom one is 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.309
 to return to him 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.529
 this way the faces of the corner of the three corners will have been voted that is not 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.489
 honest 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.449
 this for what it serves 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.650
 percent 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.820
 but showed on the fourth finger because things of the hand 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.459
 that she did not limit age
