quarter circles and have to cut these in
it<00:02:52.980> also<00:02:53.130> involves<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.970> certain<00:02:54.630> amount<00:02:54.840> of

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
it also involves a certain amount of

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.960 
it also involves a certain amount of
paper<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:55.470> again<00:02:55.830> also<00:02:55.980> emphasized

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
paper in which again also emphasized

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.280 
paper in which again also emphasized
we're<00:02:57.540> always<00:02:57.660> looking<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.080> good

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
we're always looking for good

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.860 
we're always looking for good
apprentices<00:02:59.060> ticket<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.330> work<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.750> our

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
apprentices ticket to work in our

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.080 
apprentices ticket to work in our
industry<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> was<00:03:02.489> quite<00:03:02.640> interesting<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
industry so I was quite interesting to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:21.720 
industry so I was quite interesting to
see<00:03:03.300> how<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.450> gap<00:03:03.600> they<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.319> on<00:03:04.410> with<00:03:04.560> tasks

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.149 

and<00:03:22.480> basic<00:03:22.959> introduction<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> kids<00:03:23.980> have

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
and basic introduction to the kids have

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.190 
and basic introduction to the kids have
come<00:03:24.310> from<00:03:24.459> school<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.269> they<00:03:25.420> have<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.599> taster

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
come from school so they have a taster

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680 
come from school so they have a taster
of<00:03:26.409> the<00:03:26.830> different<00:03:27.069> trades<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:28.269> try<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.480> cover

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
of the different trades we try to cover

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.740 
of the different trades we try to cover
the<00:03:28.840> major<00:03:29.019> trade<00:03:29.409> brickwork<00:03:30.099> joinery

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the major trade brickwork joinery

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.259 
the major trade brickwork joinery
plastering<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:32.680> also<00:03:32.890> do<00:03:33.099> tiling<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.819> little

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
plastering we also do tiling a little

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.149 
plastering we also do tiling a little
bit<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.480> basic<00:03:34.810> plumbing<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.530> then<00:03:35.890> we<00:03:36.010> go

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
bit of basic plumbing and then we go

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.460 
bit of basic plumbing and then we go
into<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.640> theory<00:03:37.330> side<00:03:37.569> of<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.049> tasks<00:03:38.349> for

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
into the theory side of it the tasks for

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.880 
into the theory side of it the tasks for
today<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.239> look<00:03:40.360> at<00:03:40.569> it<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.290> basic

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
today is what to look at it it's a basic

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.789 
today is what to look at it it's a basic
shape<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.370> house<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.970> they<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.019> do

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
shape of a house and they have to do

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.009 
shape of a house and they have to do
different<00:03:45.370> types<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.790> joinery<00:03:46.030> cuts<00:03:46.480> there's

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
different types of joinery cuts there's

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.800 
different types of joinery cuts there's
setting<00:03:47.709> out<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.160> specific<00:03:49.030> measurements<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
setting out to specific measurements and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.649 
setting out to specific measurements and
then<00:03:50.560> there's<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.950> tiling<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.120> goes<00:03:52.299> within

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
then there's a tiling that goes within

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.110 
then there's a tiling that goes within
the<00:03:52.870> shape
