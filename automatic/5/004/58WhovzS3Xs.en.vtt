00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
this one's a quantum kbd it's it's got a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.509 
this one's a quantum kbd it's it's got a
flip<00:00:28.439> switch<00:00:28.679> here<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> flip

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
use different types of casting for

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.870 
use different types of casting for
different<00:01:58.750> situations<00:01:59.340> when<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.369> need<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.759> make

a<00:02:00.940> real<00:02:01.270> accurate<00:02:01.509> cast<00:02:01.990> but<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.380> might<00:02:02.530> but

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
a real accurate cast but it might but

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.160 
a real accurate cast but it might but
not<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.280> really<00:02:03.670> forecast<00:02:04.179> I<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> go<00:02:05.140> over

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
not be really forecast I like to go over

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.910 
not be really forecast I like to go over
him<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.099> that<00:02:06.539> okay<00:02:07.539> just<00:02:07.920> because

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
him just like that okay just because

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.280 
him just like that okay just because
that<00:02:09.700> makes<00:02:09.880> me<00:02:10.060> make<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.599> helps<00:02:10.990> me<00:02:11.140> make

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
that makes me make that helps me make

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.380 
that makes me make that helps me make
more<00:02:11.560> accurate<00:02:11.950> casts<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:12.970> might<00:02:13.360> not

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
more accurate casts but might not

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.020 
more accurate casts but might not
necessarily<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:14.200> long<00:02:14.500> casts<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
necessarily be long casts if I have a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.660 
necessarily be long casts if I have a
big<00:02:16.300> open<00:02:16.630> area<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:18.430> don't

what<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.360> mean<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.050> what<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:32.739> personal

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
what I mean it's all what your personal

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.460 
what I mean it's all what your personal
preferences<00:02:34.300> but<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:36.069> me<00:02:36.220> I'm<00:02:37.120> much<00:02:38.110> better

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
preferences but for me I'm much better

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.540 
preferences but for me I'm much better
for<00:02:39.069> long<00:02:39.400> cast<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.930> side<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.550> but

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
for long cast to the side like that but

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.740 
for long cast to the side like that but
it<00:02:42.640> might<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.819> be<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.750> don't<00:02:44.410> know<00:02:45.750> I'm

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
it might not be for you I don't know I'm

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.860 
it might not be for you I don't know I'm
not<00:02:46.900> saying<00:02:47.110> that's<00:02:47.349> for<00:02:47.500> everyone<00:02:47.800> it's<00:02:48.489> not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
not saying that's for everyone it's not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.460 
not saying that's for everyone it's not
but<00:02:49.870> yeah

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
but yeah

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.360 
but yeah
all<00:02:52.220> right<00:02:52.310> um<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.240> yeah<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.830> all<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
all right um so yeah so all you have to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.810 
all right um so yeah so all you have to
do<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:57.470> there's<00:02:57.620> another<00:02:57.680> cast<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.580> like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
do then there's another cast that I like

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.680 
do then there's another cast that I like
to<00:02:58.940> use<00:02:59.150> which<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:02.060> instead<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.480> like

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
to use which is the like instead of like

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.630 
to use which is the like instead of like
straight<00:03:03.140> over<00:03:03.440> hand<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:04.190> kind<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.490> like<00:03:04.580> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
straight over hand it's kind of like a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.980 
straight over hand it's kind of like a
diagonal<00:03:05.360> like<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:05.890> look<00:03:06.890> back<00:03:07.540> whip<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.570> and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
diagonal like this look back whip it and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.560 
diagonal like this look back whip it and
that<00:03:09.740> cast<00:03:10.250> also<00:03:10.520> goes<00:03:10.820> really<00:03:11.000> far<00:03:11.270> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that cast also goes really far and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.140 
that cast also goes really far and
sometimes<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.260> gets<00:03:12.290> too<00:03:12.830> accurate<00:03:13.100> places<00:03:13.670> so

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
sometimes it gets too accurate places so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.260 
sometimes it gets too accurate places so
that's<00:03:14.270> like<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> combination<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
that's like a combination of the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.240 
that's like a combination of the
overhand<00:03:17.270> cast<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.810> side<00:03:18.050> cast<00:03:18.350> vinyl

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.540 

that<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.400> about<00:03:22.780> 30<00:03:23.780> 40<00:03:24.290> yards<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:25.430> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
that what about 30 40 yards which is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.880 
that what about 30 40 yards which is
probably<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> farthest<00:03:26.330> i<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.630> get<00:03:26.890> all

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
probably the farthest i can get all

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.390 
probably the farthest i can get all
right<00:03:31.030> now<00:03:32.030> I'm<00:03:32.120> going<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.300> get<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:33.400> like

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
right now I'm going to get it to like

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.640 
right now I'm going to get it to like
you<00:03:34.520> should<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.820> backlash<00:03:35.300> all<00:03:35.810> right<00:03:35.930> here

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
you should get a backlash all right here

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.180 
you should get a backlash all right here
the<00:03:36.740> backlash<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.459> your<00:03:37.580> fake<00:03:38.030> ass<00:03:38.209> real

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
the backlash with your fake ass real

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.949 
the backlash with your fake ass real
that<00:03:40.190> shows<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.580> you're<00:03:40.790> trying<00:03:43.810> let's<00:03:44.810> go

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
that shows that you're trying let's go

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.400 
that shows that you're trying let's go
over<00:03:45.140> backlashes<00:03:46.480> I'm<00:03:47.480> going<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.690> suck<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.380> up

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
over backlashes I'm going to suck it up

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.590 
over backlashes I'm going to suck it up
and<00:03:48.530> do<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:53.140> that's<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.260> backlash<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:56.390> looks

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
and do it that's a backlash and it looks

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.360 
and do it that's a backlash and it looks
nasty<00:03:56.810> doesn't<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.310> nasty<00:03:58.690> but<00:04:00.370> for

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
nasty doesn't it and it is nasty but for

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.300 
nasty doesn't it and it is nasty but for
backlash<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.600> lot<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.810> cases<00:04:03.080> all<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.220> have

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
backlash and a lot of cases all you have

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.040 
backlash and a lot of cases all you have
to<00:04:04.370> do<00:04:04.519> is<00:04:04.730> let<00:04:05.150> out<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.360> bunch<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.720> wine<00:04:05.870> like

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
to do is let out a bunch of wine like

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.430 
to do is let out a bunch of wine like
this<00:04:06.200> we<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.410> fell<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:06.769> it<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:08.440> eventually

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
this we just fell on it and eventually

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.250 
this we just fell on it and eventually
the<00:04:10.040> backlash<00:04:10.430> goes<00:04:10.670> away<00:04:10.959> sometimes<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.170> it's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
the backlash goes away sometimes if it's

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.600 
the backlash goes away sometimes if it's
really<00:04:12.590> bad<00:04:12.709> you<00:04:12.890> have<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.040> use<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> backlash

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
really bad you have to use a backlash

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.699 
really bad you have to use a backlash
pick<00:04:13.880> or<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.330> have<00:04:14.450> even<00:04:15.080> have<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.410> cut<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
pick or you have even have to cut the

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.289 
pick or you have even have to cut the
line<00:04:15.860> which<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.160> terrible<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.790> hate<00:04:17.000> doing<00:04:17.150> that

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
line which is terrible I hate doing that

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.540 
line which is terrible I hate doing that
so<00:04:20.299> yeah<00:04:20.479> let<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.169> backlash<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.979> for<00:04:22.310> an<00:04:22.370> easy

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
so yeah let the backlash and for an easy

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.460 
so yeah let the backlash and for an easy
backlash<00:04:23.060> like<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.900> was<00:04:24.020> kind<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.229> needed

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
backlash like that was kind of needed

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.260 
backlash like that was kind of needed
backlash<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.100> all<00:04:25.280> I'm<00:04:25.370> going<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.550> be<00:04:25.760> doing<00:04:25.940> is

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
backlash so all I'm going to be doing is

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.180 
backlash so all I'm going to be doing is
just<00:04:26.479> letting<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.080> lot<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.380> line<00:04:27.560> out<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:28.070> like

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
just letting a lot of line out just like

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.230 
just letting a lot of line out just like
this<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.729> then

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
this and then

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:43.610 
this and then
you<00:04:30.360> doing<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.810> doing<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.259> you<00:04:31.319> do<00:04:31.560> it

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.500 

yes

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.380 

now<00:04:47.110> there's<00:04:47.290> no<00:04:47.380> backlash<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:48.190> just<00:04:49.120> let<00:04:49.300> it

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
now there's no backlash I just let it

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.590 
now there's no backlash I just let it
all<00:04:49.420> out<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.850> when<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.090> when<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.450> a

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
all out on and when and when you have a

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.630 
all out on and when and when you have a
backlash<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.350> let<00:04:54.070> out<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.490> line

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
backlash and you let out on that line

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.490 
backlash and you let out on that line
make<00:04:55.360> sure<00:04:55.390> that<00:04:55.600> when<00:04:55.930> you're<00:04:56.050> really<00:04:56.380> not

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
make sure that when you're really not

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.410 
make sure that when you're really not
all<00:04:56.740> aligning<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.640> hold<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.090> with<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.240> hand

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
all aligning you hold it with one hand

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.510 
all aligning you hold it with one hand
on<00:04:58.720> your<00:04:58.870> rod<00:04:59.020> like<00:04:59.260> that<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.130> goes<00:05:00.310> in
